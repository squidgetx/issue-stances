{"id": "1011079659.xml", "text": "<h2>Conservative cliches</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many of us who pontificate for a living, my column-writing colleague Jonah Goldberg apparently toils away in daily frustration that so many people fail to take his political advice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would explain his new book, which takes on one of the world's least threatening problems, the political cliches that many people utter as a substitute for original thought.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is titled \"The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas.\" With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like \"violence never settles anything\" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word \"never.\" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, \"Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer.\" Goldberg responds, \"So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?\" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like \"Diversity is strength,\" either. (\"Cool,\" he writes. \"The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!\") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\" Sure, he writes, \"if the other man is an idiot.\" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"We don't solve problems by throwing money at them.\" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.\" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare.\" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left.\" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"America: Love It Or Leave It.\" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?\" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, \"Reality has a liberal bias.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet. But give it time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board and blogs at chicagotribune.com/pagespage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>cpage@tribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @cptime</p>\n"}
{"id": "1022742622.xml", "text": "<h2>Vision quest</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1933, four years after a calamitous market crash, Americans were losing hope. But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. \"They have no vision,\" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, \"and when there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. \"I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,\" he said. \"I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of \"job creators\" and eliminating \"red tape that's strangling business.\" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a \"grand bargain\" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of \"austerity\" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving \"welfare queens.\" This was a continuation of Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, \"the vision thing.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\" His consulting firm, Westen Strategies, is not working for either candidate in this year's presidential race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:Danny Schwartz For The Times</p>\n"}
{"id": "1372854272.xml", "text": "<h2>Three Justices Bound by Beliefs, Not Just Gender</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON --  You can tell a lot about the Supreme Court by looking at who voted with whom. There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. \"They are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,\" said Pamela Harris, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown's law school.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court's liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from Scotusblog, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on \"60 Minutes,\" talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited \"Sesame Street\" and \"The View.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,\" said Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. \"Like the other two women, she's very comfortable up there, and that's a great thing for a woman like me to see.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People love her!\" wrote Lee Epstein, who teaches at the University of Southern California. \"She made a lot of money!\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Sotomayor's financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Ginsburg's form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an \"award recipient gift bag\" worth $2,500 -- a swag bag, in the lingo -- when she received Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said Lisa T. McElroy, a law professor at Drexel University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's important to note that the agreement was not on 'women's' or 'social justice' issues,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The female justices were divided in two of the term's biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of a challenge to California's ban on the practice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, \"they are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision allowing the police to take DNA samples from arrestees and in dissents from rulings limiting the use of police dogs to sniff for drugs outside homes and warrantless blood testing of people stopped for drunken driving.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,\" Justice Scalia told an audience at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia described their trip in an interview in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It was, unfortunately, not successful,\" he said. \"We got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn't get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"She dropped that doe with one shot,\" he said of Justice Kagan's exercise of her Second Amendment rights. \"Boom. Just like that.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship. \"I can't imagine Ruth hunting,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From Left, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.

{"id": "1761271674.xml", "text": "<h2>Ease the poverty penalty in college admissions</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harold O. Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a \"legacy preference\" to children of alumni. Even the \"athletic preference\" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and \"cold.\" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harold O. Levy</p>\n"}
{"id": "1878508466.xml", "text": "<h2>What to ask Judge Gorsuch; Look beyond politics and his resume. Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to \"the little guy,\" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an \"originalist,\" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to \"apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, \"text\" and \"history\" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the \"equal protection of the laws\" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an \"originalist\" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated \"well qualified\" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "1987023512.xml", "text": "<h2>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality. It is too painful to look at. Reality is too hard to accept.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mental health experts routinely say that denial is among the most common defense mechanisms. Denial is how the person defends his superior sense of self, her racially unequal society.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is how America defends itself as superior to \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa and elsewhere, as President Trump reportedly described them in a White House meeting last week, although he has since, well, denied that. It\u2019s also how America defends itself as superior to those \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d in Africa, to quote how liberal opponents of Mr. Trump might often describe them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump appears to be unifying America \u2014 unifying Americans in their denial. The more racist Mr. Trump sounds, the more Trump country denies his racism, and the more his opponents look away from their own racism to brand Trump country as racist. Through it all, America remains a unified country of denial.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reckoning of Mr. Trump\u2019s racism must become the reckoning of American racism. Because the American creed of denial \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not a racist\u201d \u2014 knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, affirmed that Mr. Trump did use the term \u201cshithole\u201d during a White House meeting on immigration with lawmakers. Mr. Durbin rightfully described Mr. Trump\u2019s words as \u201chate-filled, vile and racist,\u201d and added, \u201cI cannot believe that in the history of the White House in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump is no exception. In framing Mr. Trump\u2019s racism as exceptional, in seeking to highlight the depth of the president\u2019s cruelty, Mr. Durbin, a reliably liberal senator, showed the depth of denial of American racism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Begin with the eight presidents who held slaves while in the Oval Office. Then consider how Abraham Lincoln urged black people to leave the United States. \u201cEven when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race,\u201d Lincoln told five black guests at the White House in 1862. So \u201cit is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raging then as we are raging now, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison responded, \u201cCan anything be more puerile, absurd, illogical, impertinent, untimely?\u201d He added that \u201chad it not been for the cupidity of their white enslavers, not one of their race would now be found upon this continent.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d-praising Woodrow Wilson \u2014 and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said \u201cnigger\u201d nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban \u201chell\u201d of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words \u201call men are created equal,\u201d which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people \u201care inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump\u2019s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near \u201cdangerous\u201d black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture \u2014 all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to \u201cavoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by\u201d the \u201cracist appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism. It still holds fast after all these years. The vocabulary list includes these: law and order. War on drugs. Model minority. Reverse discrimination. Race-neutral. Welfare queen. Handout. Tough on crime. Personal responsibility. Black-on-black crime. Achievement gap. No excuses. Race card. Colorblind. Post-racial. Illegal immigrant. Obamacare. War on Cops. Blue Lives Matter. All Lives Matter. Entitlements. Voter fraud. Economic anxiety.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The denials using these phrases come from both conservatives and white liberals who think people of color are stuck in cycles of unstable families and criminal cultures, and that the deprivations of poverty and discrimination spin out bad people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump opened his candidacy with racism, calling Mexicans criminals and rapists. Since taking office, he has looked away from the disaster zone in Puerto Rico, he has called some violent white supremacists \u201cvery fine people,\u201d and he has described Nigerians as living in \u201chuts .\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When someone identifies the obvious, Mr. Trump resounds the beat of denial as he did before he was president: \u201cI\u2019m the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever met ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever seen ,\u201d that \u201cyou\u2019ve ever encountered .\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are ugly denials. But it\u2019s the denials from those who stand in strong opposition to this president that are more frustrating to me: denials that their attacks on identity politics are racist. Denials that the paltry number of people of color in elite spaces marks racism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those denials echo the same ones that frustrated Dr. King in 1963 as he sat in a Birmingham jail cell and wrote , \u201cShallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, I suspect, will go to his grave with his heart beating in denial of the ill will of racism. Many others will as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because we naturally want to look away from our ugliness. We paint over racist reality to make a beautiful delusion of self, of society. We defend this beautiful self and society from our racist reality with the weapons of denial.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being a racist. Feeding the stigma is how \u201cracist\u201d is considered almost like an identity, a brand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a racist is not who a person is. A racist is what a person is, what a person is saying, what a person is doing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racist is not a fixed category like \u201cnot racist,\u201d which is steeped denial. Only racists say they are not racist. Only the racist lives by the heartbeat of denial.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The antiracist lives by the opposite heartbeat, one that rarely and irregularly sounds in America \u2014 the heartbeat of confession.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/opinion/sunday/heartbeat-of-racism-denial.html?partner=bloomberg</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: IBRAM X.

{"id": "2065768718.xml", "text": "<h2>This Is No Time for Liberal Despair</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fight over President Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee is going to feel frustrating for Democrats. Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats \u2014 or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here\u2019s a three-step guide to doing so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump\u2019s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator \u2014 yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don\u2019t lose hope.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy\u2019s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement \u2014 creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can\u2019t afford to do so anymore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u201cConservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,\u201d Skocpol told me, \u201cso they built from the bottom up.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court\u2019s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies \u2014 like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering \u2014 that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections \u2014 as they\u2019ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans\u2019 voting rights \u2014 among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that\u2019s a fight for another day. Most experts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 scholars and people in politics \u2014 believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it\u2019s a hypothetical concern. \u201cThe potential center-left majority in this country \u2014 and it\u2019s very real \u2014 has to actually organize and elect people to office,\u201d Skocpol says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration\u2019s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee\u2019s Senate hearing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That\u2019s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p>\n"}

The program helped to get thousands of minorities into the middle class, where they promptly retreated into the comforts of whiteness. Your 180-degree turn on the issue radicalized college students.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias, most of all, for Proposition 187. You didn't author the 1994 measure, which declared war on immigrants in the country illegally and the people who helped them. But you jumped on the 187 bandwagon and took the reins as soon as you could to help resurrect your flagging reelection campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, Mexican Americans like me realized for the first time that a large part of society still considered us \"Mexican\" and not \"American,\" like we always believed ourselves to be. Most of us have identified with the former more than the latter ever since.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias to Proposition 187, MEChA bounced back. The Chicano high school and college group was slowly losing its power as more Mexican Americans began to identify as \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" and wanted no part with radical politics. Because of 187, MEChA members went on to reinvigorate the labor movement, introduce ethnic studies in high schools, and make Dia de los Muertos a thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring Latinos to enter politics like never before. And gracias for making the defense of immigrants their rallying cry. From state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra's zeal, to bringing back driver's licenses for the undocumented (which you took away), to declaring us a sanctuary state, it's all a direct response to your cynicism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gracias for inspiring two of the most hilarious death-metal songs ever: \"Matando Gueros\" (\"Killing White People\") and \"Raza Odiada\" (\"Hated Race\"), both by Brujeria.

{"id": "2212953270.xml", "text": "<h2>They Call Me Doctor Berry</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TERRE HAUTE, Ind. \u2014 I HAVE never been big on titles. Many people I interact with outside my job don\u2019t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I\u2019m Carlotta Berry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I\u2019m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like \u201cBone Saw.\u201d But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don\u2019t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many \u2014 though by no means all, or even most \u2014 there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it \u2014 anti-affirmative-action ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it\u2019s just a sense, a feeling I get from people\u2019s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I\u2019m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to in other classes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they\u2019re often surprised. It\u2019s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn\u2019t just about me \u2014 it\u2019s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won\u2019t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2230209410.xml", "text": "<h2>Editorial Observer; Hell Hath No Fury Like a Conservative Who Is Victorious</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lino Graglia was standing in a meeting room at the Mayflower Hotel, and he was hopping mad. The only question was, Why?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2234177127.xml", "text": "<h2>Abroad at Home; Hypocrites in Power</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been contemptible Congresses before, and historians can argue about which was worst. But I remember none in modern times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans, members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make student loans -- $692 million to one company alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They bleat about states' rights. But they push through a bill to override the physician-assisted-suicide law twice approved by Oregon voters, and another bill to bar state courts from hearing class actions brought against industries that make big political contributions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unable to do what they want through the regular legislative process, senators have tacked on to appropriation bills a dozen riders stripping away environmental protections. Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back.

A coalition of civil rights groups made the settlement possible by agreeing to pay 70 percent of the $433,500 judgment that Sharon Taxman won in a lower court for back pay and lawyers' fees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> thought that the Supreme Court, which was scheduled to hear the case in January, was likely to find the race-based layoff decision improper. They also feared the Court would have gone further and prohibited consideration of racial criteria in employment in general, thus jeopardizing voluntary affirmative-action plans in all workplaces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Avoiding a Supreme Court ruling, in this situation, was a smart move. The Piscataway case was a difficult one with unusual facts. The teachers, hired the same day, had equal seniority and comparable qualifications. The school district, forced to trim staff for budget reasons, chose to keep the black teacher because she was the only black teacher in her department. The district's goal of maintaining racial diversity was honorable, but its approach was clumsy. The Clinton Administration, which first supported the action, reversed itself this summer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At some point, the Supreme Court will address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in any employment decision, except as a remedy for actual discrimination. The Piscataway case, however, was a poor vehicle for that legal debate.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2236765173.xml", "text": "<h2>How to Save Affirmative Action</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p>\n"}

But the leaker didn\u2019t know, or wouldn\u2019t say, which way the case came out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It's an experiment providing a \"universal basic income,\" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be \"mothers of color.\" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny\u2014to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based affirmative-action programs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that \"this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color\" because they face \"the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p>\n"}

But it hasn\u2019t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom\u2019s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access \u2014 such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people \u2014 are at risk. We fear the state\u2019s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state\u2019s generous support of citizen engagement \u2014 its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials \u2014 that has led to this threat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it\u2019s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state\u2019s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state\u2019s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs \u2014 on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what\u2019s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p>\n"}

We used to be roommates long ago, and she's finally marrying her partner of 10 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When she told me she was getting married, she did all the usual things that people who are about to be married do. She showed me a picture of her dress, and we talked about the kind of cake they were going to get. In the end, she and her partner decided they'd have a quick wedding in Las Vegas and then do another, more formal ceremony back east in the city where we live. That's this evening, and I'm happy for both of them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I used the word \"partner\" in an attempt to be intentionally vague. But I'll tell you now that the bride is a cisgender woman. Her husband is a cisgender man. In short, it's the kind of wedding that conservatives believe is the only kind of wedding that counts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's a more complex aspect to their nuptials. She is bisexual and proudly so. It just so happens that she fell in love with a man. She has had many relationships with women. Had she fallen in love with a woman, it's quite possible that the seamstress could have refused to alter her dress, the bakery could have refused to make her a cake. But she avoided all of that by marrying a man.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Supreme Court has been very busy lately making clear which kinds of people it truly values. By striking down Roe v. Wade, the justices showed us how much they value the opinions of women who want a say in their own health care. By striking down <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, they showed us how much they value White over Black and Brown students. By striking down student loan forgiveness, they demonstrated how much they value those who don't have enough money to avoid the Ponzi scheme called student loans. And today they essentially legalized the unequal treatment of LGBTQ people by holding that discrimination is a small price to pay if it lifts up just one kind of love.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Supreme Court has become a conservative dreamland: Out of touch with the country and determined to satisfy conservatives who think they win only when someone else loses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lorie Smith, the Colorado web designer who refuses to make websites for LGBTQ people, may experience a boom in her business. This legal action was the best thing she could have done to make that happen. I don't know if she's a particularly good web designer or not, but I do know she will be lionized in some circles because she helped make people who conservatives don't like suffer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This need by conservatives is not about faith, really. It's about ensuring that Americans they don't know and don't like will suffer. They consider it a win for White people when Black and Brown people suffer. A win for men when women suffer. A win for older, richer people when younger, poorer people suffer. Everything in their minds is binary. We win. You lose. Black and white. And our current Supreme Court has become the favored weapon in their arsenal to bring about heartache for those they don't like.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it won't end here. Because whatever lines the justices may think they have carefully drawn during this term, their benefactors in the deep conservative world are just getting warmed up. Get ready for more: More behavior on your part that they will essentially outlaw. More things we're not allowed to teach. More roads for access unceremoniously cut off. More rights trampled on, and more barriers to discrimination lowered. Because the main priority of our conservative Supreme Court is to keep the status quo secure. Solid. And that means keeping certain people down.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, I will go to my friend's wedding in a few hours. And I will smile and have a good time, and I will be happy for her. There will be other LGBTQ friends of hers in attendance, and none of us would dream of sullying her day by reminding her that she's unintentionally made a choice that now, thanks to six people in Washington, places her above us in the American hierarchy of who matters most.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was never put in a position to have her right to the pursuit of happiness questioned.</p>\n"}

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities \u2014 the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC\u2019s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success \u2014 a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles \u2014 I\u2019m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don\u2019t enroll in and 85% don\u2019t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU \u2014 a historically Black college or university \u2014 in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We\u2019re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn\u2019t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn\u2019t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> world?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s just one way: one student at a time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we\u2019ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of \u201ccollege access managers,\u201d who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they\u2019re college ready.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students\u2019 need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not how high a student\u2019s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It\u2019s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students\u2019 own determination \u2014 the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it\u2019s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398955309.xml", "text": "<h2>Cross Country: A Tale of Two Daleys</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago -- Power, like yogurt and celebrity, is generally thought to have an expiration date. Not always, not everywhere -- and not, apparently, here in Chicago, where one family, the Daleys, has controlled the political action from City Hall for going on four decades. Richard J. Daley, or Daley pere, was mayor of the city from 1955 to 1976, and died in office; Richard M. Daley, or Daley fils, began his run in 1989, and it begins to look as if I, who am five years his elder, am quite likely to die while he is still in office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time a local politician makes a noise suggesting that he would like to make a run at the Daley dynasty, as by now it must be reckoned. Most recently, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who does a fair impression of a serious politician -- unlike his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who does a very poor imitation of Martin Luther King Jr. -- has criticized Daley fils for yet another of the small- and large-bore scandals -- this one having to do with affirmative-action contracts -- that are as indispensable to Chicago politics as nitrogen to plant life.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Jackson is on record as saying, \"I am concerned about the reports of rampant corruption and fraud and abuse in the city. I'm interested in our city restoring honesty and integrity in our government.\" (Pause here for chortle followed by yawn.) He also insists that he has no intention of opposing Daley fils in his run for his sixth term as mayor in 2007, though he wouldn't rule it out. (Pause here for raised left eyebrow followed by cynical smile.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet whoever might run against him in 2007 -- even if candidates were to include a combined reincarnation of Winston Churchill, Gandhi, Disraeli, and the Archangel Michael -- Daley fils will be, as they say in Vegas, a prohibitive favorite. To be sure, he has done some very high-handed things in office; the most impressive of all in this line was plowing up Meigs Field, the city's small downtown lakeshore airport the survival of which everyone else thought was still up for discussion, and doing it, as the mystery writers like to say, by dark of night. But most Chicagoans don't seem to hold any of it against him. Hey, the kid's OK.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption, like sexual satisfaction, is relative. Corruption under Daley pere was widespread and wide open. Everything that passed through City Hall was for sale: health and building inspectors, cops, judges, even in one notorious instance -- the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential election -- the White House. (I first heard the motto \"Vote early, vote often\" during this election, where it was more a modus operandi than a mere motto.) Some people see corruption as intrinsic to, if not inherent in, big-city government, and I'm afraid that I happen to be one of them, but then I'm an American, like the man said, Chicago-born.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has ever accused the Daleys, father or son, of being thieves. Their interest has never been in money -- only in what money can do to smooth the way to power, which for them has always been the real point and prize of politics. Critics of Rich Daley -- the father was known as Dick, a harder name for a more obdurate man -- say that politics in Chicago under him is business as usual. I don't believe this is quite so, but in any case if corruption has gone on during his administrations, he at least has provided real compensations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chicago was once a city distinguished by having not one but two skid rows: one on south State Street, the other on west Madison. Under Rich Daley both have been replaced by charming neighborhoods lived in for the most part by the go-go young. Once drab and dreary neighborhoods show new buildings, lots of rehab, and Starbucks as far as the eye can see. Where squalor once was, youthful gentry now reside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everywhere around the city flowers and trees have been planted. The new Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry outdoor concert hall, skating rink, modern sculptures, charming walkways, and fields for lolling is a great hit with everyone who has seen it. The Chicago of my youth, filled with gruff cigar-smoking pols in size 48 suits, suddenly seems a city for the young, who appear delighted to be in a city with so much to offer and themselves lend the metropolis a winning liveliness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the Daleys, especially when Harold Washington and his successor Eugene Sawyer, both black men, were in office, racial feeling in the city was raw and the confrontations between blacks and whites in the City Council was ugly. Rich Daley has done a good deal to eliminate that. No one, I think, would say that he is in the least racist. Cliche though it sounds, he really does seem to want to be the mayor of all Chicagoans. In the 2003 four-candidate mayoral election, he won 79% of the vote, though voter turnout was down to only 34%, expressing either satisfaction or voter apathy, or (most likely) confidence that he was unbeatable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rich Daley appears to have no theory of government, but merely a boundless appetite for governing. He is a fix-it, a problem-solving, man, treating the city of Chicago as if it were an unending episode of \"This Old House\" -- and he seems to be turning the old heap into a damn stately mansion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the real secret behind the Daley family success is the fixed but limited ambition of both father and son. Neither Dick nor Rich Daley ever aspired to rise any higher than Mayor of the City of Chicago. Dick Daley, doubtless, enjoyed being a kingmaker and a power in the Democratic Party; this would appear to be less true of Rich Daley, but then the age of king-making Democratic Party bosses seems to be over. A homeboy, the current mayor does not wish to become governor or a U.S. senator, or -- here's a thought to pass on to the search committee in Cambridge -- the next president of Harvard. That goes a good way to explaining why he is so good at his job and why he is likely to be able to keep it for as long as he likes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Epstein is the author, most recently, of \"Envy\" (Oxford, 2003).</p>\n"}

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in \"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was \"like bringing pornography to work.\" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. \"The Klan still rules Indiana,\" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of \"openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers.\" The statement, signed by chief <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this \"inflammatory topic.\" \"We conclude,\" the letter informed him, \"that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . .\" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was \"permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time.\" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the \"racially abhorrent\" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any \"future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action\" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address \"conduct\" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? \"Harassing behavior.\" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were \"a fairy tale,\" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' \"sly racist\" tactics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. \"We know the strategy,\" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say \"he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities.

{"id": "408321836.xml", "text": "<h2>The Power Ignored by the Press</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago there was a flurry of interest by the press in the activities of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations. Some, we discovered, acted as conduits for CIA subsidies to civic and educational organizations and subsidized the publication of various books and magazines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was all part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, although many recipients of the agency's cash didn't know that and didn't know their patron. Not much came from these disclosures. The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, \"The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The \"public interests\" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their \"public interest\" cousins on condition that they forswear any \"attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the \"public interest\" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents \"enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail.\" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, \"which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad.\" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they \"have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. \"But it was seldom noted {in the press},\" Skerry observes, \"that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) \"which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the \"civic journalism\" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of \"civic journalism\" is that the public, through polls and \"focus groups\" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with \"a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take.\" He puts Pew in that category.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations \"have no voters, no customers, no investors.\" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the \"main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.\"</p>\n"}
{"id": "408366163.xml", "text": "<h2>Foreign Affairs in Annapolis</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was \"a little taken aback\" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. \"You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,\" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, \"MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,\" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as \"enormously secretive and powerful\" and \"a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . \"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the \"tantamount\" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. \"The State Department testimony only helped me more,\" says Baker. \"They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it.\" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409060590.xml", "text": "<h2>Ashcroft The Activist</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the nominee is technically qualified for the job and is, moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole thing seems to be missing the point. I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would \"enforce the law fairly\" aren't much help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws \"fairly\"? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and \"crack\" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll \"enforce the law.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>) \"limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p>\n"}

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,\" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,\" Adler said, by enviros and \"pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? \"Poor communication,\" writes Adler. That plus \"the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,\" he said. \"If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were \"no industry beneficiaries\" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word \"arsenic.\" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps \"Rosewater?\" Or \"Passion Mist?\" Maybe \"Old Lace?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with \"fecal matter?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest. Our invite from all the Democratic women senators says they're holding a \"special reception honoring\" Sen.

But there's a problem for all those well-heeled PAC folks. It's \"Personal checks only.\" So if you want to see maison Clinton and those new decorations, it's going to come out of your pocket.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember the Dan Burton cuff links on eBay for $9.99 that got no bids for five days?

Heimbold Jr., deputy chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, to be ambassador to Sweden.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the early front-runner for Rome, Rockwell Schnabel, is said to have faded of late, and Charles Gargano, a favorite of the Italian American lobby, is moving out front. Another name heard in the mix is former New Jersey representative William J. Martini (R).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Roger Noriega, a top aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), is said to be the front- runner for ambassador to the Organization of American States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> here, the Bush administration says, but even so, 40 percent of Bush's announcements for top-tier positions -- those requiring Senate confirmation -- have been women and minorities, according to a review of Bush's first 158 picks by the Brookings Presidential Appointee Initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 25 percent of Bush's picks have been women and 20 percent are minorities: 11.4 percent are African American, 3.2 percent are Hispanic and 5.1 percent are Asian.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This compares to President Clinton's 37 percent women and 15 percent African Americans, according to a 1993 Knight Ridder study. Numbers of Hispanics and Asians were not available.

{"id": "409936292.xml", "text": "<h2>The Forces That Set the Agenda</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the grand scheme of things, Social Security isn't the nation's biggest fiscal problem. That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular \"grass- roots\" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the \"death tax\" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing. Interest groups float along, waiting for the perfect wave of public sentiment or official fiat to carry their issues to victory. They can't create the wave, but they can be ready for the moment when it comes. The key is to be prepared for that moment: Not every issue has an organization with the wealth and staying power to be in that position. Those that do have a shot at winning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Lobbying is subtle and complicated,\" says John W. Kingdon, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan who studies interest groups. But the most important attribute of a successful lobbying campaign, he says, is persistence --  something that only entrenched organizations possess.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It takes a sustained organization, mobilized followers and an immense amount of power to get onto a legislative agenda,\" agrees Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, interest groups have replaced political parties as the real influence brokers. Candidates for office rely on these groups for campaign cash, for campaign workers and, increasingly, for campaign issues  --  all of which had once been the domain of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican ground troops come from such diverse groups as the NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Family Research Council and the National Rifle Association. Democratic soldiers are recruited from places like labor unions, the trial bar and Moveon.org. \"The standard distinction between interest groups and parties used to be that parties were committed to winning elections and that pressure groups let elections happen and then tried to influence the people who got elected,\" Lowi said. \"Now interest groups through their PACs and a variety of other methods are very much involved in the pre- policy arena.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such involvement has become a prime factor in agenda-setting. Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as \"big government.\" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word \"nuclear\" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening. The common view is that elites run the show and sheep- like citizens allow them to. In fact, organized interests able to motivate blocs of voters really can make a difference, as long as they can stick around for a while.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, not every vital issue has a group or groups that are clever or rich enough to generate unrelenting support from back home. That leaves out of the mix too many people with worthy woes: the unemployed, the uninsured, the unaligned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's probably an opportunity there for yet another powerful interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kstreetconfidential@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Birnbaum is a Post reporter whose</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>K Street Confidential column on the intersection of business and politics appears on alternate Mondays in the Business section.

{"id": "410325615.xml", "text": "<h2>On Its 100th Birthday, Modern Israeli City Revels in Its Openness and Vibrancy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city's story starts south of town in the ancient port of Jaffa, where the Old Testament says Jonah departed on the voyage that took him into the belly of a whale and the New Testament says Peter sorted out some of the basics of Christianity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's only an opening act. On a morning walk, tour guide Karl Walter is moving toward more contemporary events.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the walls of Old Jaffa came down in the late 1800s, people started moving to the countryside, he said. Muslims went in one direction, Christians in another. The Jews went north, to a few plots of sand on which they built a school and some houses and started what would become Tel Aviv  --  the first modern Jewish city and a destination for the earliest waves of Zionist immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city celebrates its centennial this year, its role in the nation changed from point of arrival for emigres to notorious party town and cultural and financial hub  --  a bit Manhattan, a bit L.A., a bit Ibiza, as a morning-to-dusk-to-dawn walk will show.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are those who consider it a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's early Zionist vision  --  a Jewish city, yes, but one that has a strong bohemian streak, that's creative, tolerant and wide open in its politics. There are others who see it as a bit of an abomination, removed from the daily sense of conflict that runs through cities such as Jerusalem and a place, as one Israeli columnist called it, of \"mass Shabbat desecration.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 400,000 people live in the city proper. But close to half of the country's 7 million people live in Tel Aviv's suburbs or nearby coastal towns, so the dichotomy is a reflection not just of the city but of Israel itself.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tel Aviv  --  where David Ben-Gurion declared the Jewish state's independence  --  has seen its share of violence, including suicide bombings and Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the southern Tel Aviv waterfront, Walter pointed out the stone house that used to belong to one of Jaffa's Arab leaders. It's in a field where, he said, Jewish forces converged in a battle on the eve of Ben-Gurion's declaration. The house is now a museum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Arab families were forced out or fled to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and elsewhere. A few thousand remained, their descendants clustered in Jaffa neighborhoods that have since been incorporated into a combined municipality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as city conservation director Jeremie Hoffman said, the frame of reference is often different here than in other parts of Israel. Tel Aviv residents are as apt to identify with what's happening in New York and Paris as they are with the small towns of Israel, he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoffman's work is a case in point. In a country defined in some ways by ancient disputes, he is trying to preserve architecture that is only a few decades old  --  the Bauhaus apartments built by immigrants who imported the style from Europe in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's mid-afternoon, and Hoffman is strolling through downtown neighborhoods where the city has imposed strict rules on renovating hundreds of Bauhaus buildings. The United Nations has designated the area a heritage zone. Apartments that once housed new arrivals are now million-dollar investments. This is not where the new immigrants come anymore  --  it is a second or third step, Hoffman said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, said rising property values are on her mind a lot lately. There's discussion of rent-control laws to ensure the city remains affordable for young people starting their careers as well as middle-class families.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She sips a late-afternoon coffee near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. The world's focus more often rests on Jerusalem, she said, but she's among those who will tell you that Tel Aviv is the heart of Israel's story.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This was Herzl's idea of what the Jewish land should be  --  secular, liberal, pluralistic,\" she said, citing the city's efforts to boost welfare benefits, care for the homeless, and encourage tolerance toward gays and other minorities. She winces a bit when asked about the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, though she said the city has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> policies for hiring Israeli Arabs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Tel Aviv is seen as very left-wing, but it keeps its distance,\" Arab mayoral candidate Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka said during her campaign. Redevelopment of some of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, she said, risked gentrifying the few Arab sections that remain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She did not receive many votes, but one person who supported her was writer Avner Bernheimer, who felt putting an Arab woman in charge of the city might stir things up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is just past sundown on Friday night, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Jerusalem and other more conservative towns are locked up tight to observe the day of rest. In Tel Aviv, it's the start of a party that will run into the early hours.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernheimer and his partner, architect Eran Neuman, are talking over dinner about their projects. Bernheimer is writing a television movie about human trafficking through the Sinai desert. Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning. There are discos, clubs and bars tucked into so many alleys. People line up for the most popular.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Blackbook, two men in NBA jerseys and Elvis wigs are waving sex toys in the face of an unfortunate friend celebrating a birthday.

{"id": "419426239.xml", "text": "<h2>THOMAS' INSPIRING COURAGE</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every so often I question whether I've landed on the wrong planet. Or perhaps I've slipped into another dimension where perceptions are altered, where lies are truth, where yes means no, or the meaning of \"is\" is debatable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last Wednesday was one of those days. I was reading a New York Times columnist's accounting of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner honoring him, and I wondered whether someone had spiked my water with some reality-altering chemical at my table.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reliably witty Maureen Dowd described Thomas' speech as \"bellicose,\" \"self-pitying\" and \"self-aggrandizing,\" I described the same speech to friends as inspiring. Maybe it was the stirring rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" (I'm a shameless sucker for patriotic songs.), but I seem to have heard a different speech altogether.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true, as Dowd pointed out, that the 1,600-person crowd was mostly white; that red meat was served and, presumably, eaten; that Thomas talked and talked and talked. But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of \"duty, honor, country\" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked \"comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,\" as Dowd wrote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such \"black\" issues as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,\" he said. On issues of race, \"there was no real debate or honest discussion. When whites questioned the conventional wisdom on these issues, it was considered bad form; when blacks did so, it was treason.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honest people know these words to be true, yet some would revile Thomas for saying them. Knowing that in advance--understanding that contradictory words will be greeted with personal attack and saying them anyway--requires the sort of courage Thomas was trying to advance that night and which surely he had to muster in order to make that speech.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he made clear without bellicosity, it takes courage to participate in active citizenship. It takes courage to face down jeering crowds because you invite debate. It takes courage not to be cowed into the silence of self-censorship when brutes resort to in- your-face intimidation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows this better than Thomas, a black man who managed to navigate two American cultures, both black and white, in his odyssey from Pin Point, Ga., to the U.S. Supreme Court. That sort of journey takes courage. And though Thomas never said so, it also takes guts, which this man has to spare.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Parker is a syndicated columnist based in South Carolina.

{"id": "420158599.xml", "text": "<h2>'Mushroom' answers phone but little else</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A small miracle happened Tuesday. Al \"The Mushroom\" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,\" Grzyb said nervously.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm not with the city anymore,\" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means \"mushroom\" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a \"City Official A.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any opinions on it,\" Grzyb said. \"I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it. Thank you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,\" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know nothing about it, I tell you,\" Daley insisted. \"I know nothing about it, any other questions?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes. And a very large miracle brought the Duffs $100 million of your money.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p>\n"}

He did and he was.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't remember everything that John H. Johnson, the pioneer black publisher, said when he was honored by the National Association of Black Journalists in 1987. But I probably will never forget his three words of advice:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Make yourself indispensable.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to find three better words that sum up the successful business philosophy of John Harold Johnson, who died Monday at age 87.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To black Americans of my generation, Johnson's publications Ebony, Jet and Negro Digest were indispensable reading matter, offering a brighter and more prosperous vision of black America than most of the mainstream--also known as \"white-owned\"--media provided.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To advertisers, Johnson's pioneering publications broke through the myth that the black consumer market was not worth targeting through black-owned media.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the newsstands are filled with magazines niche-marketed to blacks or Hispanics, but that really began with Johnson back in the 1940s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to journalists, particularly black journalists, Johnson's publications provided employment, a training ground and a model for how people of color might be covered in a more complete fashion than simply crime, sports or show business stories.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His 1989 autobiography \"Succeeding Against the Odds\" reads almost like a business-school series of case studies in how to solve whatever problems life throws at you.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Arkansas refused to educate black children in his area past the 8th grade, his mother, Gertrude Johnson Williams, a cook and domestic worker, saved for two years to move her family to Chicago in the 1930s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Young Johnnie was working days at a black-owned life insurance company and studying at night at Northwestern University when he started up Negro Digest in 1942 with $500 that his mother raised by borrowing against the family furniture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When its circulation stalled at 50,000 a few months later, he persisted in requesting a guest column from Eleanor Roosevelt until she agreed, immediately boosting circulation to 100,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1945, Johnson launched Ebony, a picture magazine for blacks. Its initial press run of 25,000 copies was completely sold out. Pocket-size Jet magazine began in 1951. Jet helped launch the modern civil rights movement in 1955 when it published open-casket funeral photos of the mangled body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicagoan who was savagely murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its annual special editions focusing thoughtfully on major issues of black politics and economics, we black journalists, among others, often ridiculed the sugar-coated emphasis that Ebony and Jet put on the upwardly ambitious black middle class. Yet we also understood Johnson's reluctance to focus on negative news about black life, since there was so much of that in the mainstream media.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bourgeois flavor of Johnson's publications was a minor criticism in the life of a man who overcame tremendous hardships to fill an important vacuum in black life and become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With that in mind, his \"make yourself indispensable\" speech had special resonance. Speaking to his audience of predominately young and aspiring print and broadcast journalists, he offered us the example of Matthew Henson, the black man who helped Adm. Robert Peary reach the North Pole.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henson was not hired under any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> plan or out of the goodness of Peary's heart, Johnson pointed out. Henson was hired because he had taken the time to learn the language of the Inuit people, who were indispensable to their journey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Johnson did not mention was the equally fascinating story of how he gave an autographed copy of Henson's autobiography to Zenith Electronics Corp. chief executive officer Eugene McDonald, after hearing that McDonald was a fan of arctic explorers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McDonald was impressed enough by the gift and by a four-page Ebony feature on Henson that Zenith became Ebony's first major corporate advertiser in the 1950s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He helped persuade other major corporate advertisers to follow, a major breakthrough at the time for black-oriented media. Two decades later, Johnson was elected to Zenith's board of directors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Johnson's career was full of stories like that. His life presents case studies in leadership, which is, above all, the art of problem solving. While others might fret, moan or whine, he was a get-it- done kind of guy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understood that no one, black or otherwise, would patronize your business purely out of racial loyalty. Consumers in a free market want value, service and quality. He set a high standard for all three. Despite the changing times that his publications helped to bring about, he found ways to stay indispensable.

{"id": "420549304.xml", "text": "<h2>Courtesy of Don Imus</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's been some especially witty hallway chatter at Columbia College Chicago of late. A few students -- we won't pretend to know how many -- have been plotting a swell trick to lampoon the sometimes wretched excesses of political correctness on campuses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As far as that goes, who can complain? American academia wears no single ideological facepaint. But in the aggregate, the thinking of the professoriate (and often the earnest studentoriate, too) can self-censor dangerous thoughts. These thoughts include any suggestion that individuals or groups deserve to be critiqued let alone -- heaven forfend! -- criticized. So unless the group in question holds authority, or wealth, or is otherwise by definition oppressive, even honest critiques or criticisms tend to be unwelcome. Judgment can be, you know, so judgmental.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if your worldview is more impish than that, how best to make fun of the people, the cultural values, that others hold so sacrosanct?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One whispered proposal at Columbia is an \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative Action</span> Bake Sale,\" at which white or Asian students would be charged markedly more for pastries than Latino or African-American or Native- American customers. The point is to confront the college community with the purported silliness of discriminating -- favorably and unfavorably -- on the basis of race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not irreverent enough for you? How about a rollicking game of \"Catch an Illegal Immigrant\"? Players compete for a bounty by trying to corral a student who dresses up as, say, a Guatemalan border- runner. (Extra yuks if the \"illegal\" pours water down his back, thus rendering it wet. What a hoot!)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't think ill of Columbia. Peruse news databases and you'll find similar antics at elite universities by the dozen. Columbia's students are distinguished by restraint: They'd be late to this party.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ours being a free country, there's nothing illegal about insulting groups of people in ways that some individuals in those groups might find hurtful. But noted wit Don Imus has done all of us a courtesy by letting us see the pain that a moment of hilarity can cause others. The young women from Rutgers University had the perfect response to Imus' game. They wouldn't play.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ignoring obnoxiousness is such a marvelous retort that it's remarkable how rarely most of us do that. The typical campus reaction to bake sales and immigrant games is to form committees, and draft policies, and pronounce prohibitions -- exercises in correctness that, yes, only betray an overweening fealty to correctness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if spring frolics bring a clever bake sale or border game to a campus near you, let it be. And try to imagine how Don Imus felt when he realized how his momentary fun had wounded some college kids who aren't as fortunate as he.</p>\n"}
{"id": "421215181.xml", "text": "<h2>Teeth for Anti-Bias Laws</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of us want the same basic things out of life--a good job, a decent place to live, a great school for our children. We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, was eloquent in describing them: \"Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more \"testers\"--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race.

Not these days.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bench is where players are stashed who can step in for the first team--for a governor, a U.S. senator, a state attorney general. . . . The GOP currently has none of these top positions. Democrats occupy the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats and five of seven statewide partisan offices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of two statewide elected Republicans--Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush--has suffered a potential career-ending scandal. Scratch him as a future governor. The other--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Bill Jones--angered major GOP campaign contributors by defecting to Sen. John McCain after having committed to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Jones is now on the political disabled list.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is one healthy player, and he's not exactly a bench warmer. He's the new state Senate minority leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte, 44, is the most politically savvy, articulate Republican in the Legislature. Indeed, it's tough to think of a Republican throughout California who commands more respect among politicians of either party.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He makes things happen in the Capitol,\" notes GOP consultant Ray McNally. \"And he does it without surrendering his conservative principles. Without selling out.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Brulte's first political job was slapping on bumper strips for gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan as a 10-year-old. Eventually, he became an advance man for Vice President George Bush, worked for several politicians and was elected to the Assembly in 1990.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quickly rising to Republican leader, Brulte orchestrated the GOP's \"takeover\" of the Assembly in 1994. But three Republicans sold out to Democrat Willie Brown and Brulte was denied the speakership. In 1996, he moved to the Senate, became GOP caucus chairman and, when Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine stepped down as minority leader for family health reasons last week, Brulte succeeded him without a fight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's now his responsibility to improve the GOP's 25-15 disadvantage in the Senate--or at least keep the scarce seats the party holds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What drives Brulte is political conquest and legislative compromise, not any ideological cause. He brings to the arena congeniality. \"I don't provoke people,\" notes the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260- pound GOP leader.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means less legislative gridlock.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's not one to hang up a budget over, say, abortion funding. In truth, no recent GOP leader has, partly due to Brulte's coaxing. He's basically antiabortion but tries to avoid the divisive issue. Same with gun control; he mostly votes against it, but cautions Republicans that they are on the wrong side of history on firearms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked how his party got to this low point, Brulte replies: \"It allowed itself to be painted as intolerant. It picked issues that tended to divide rather than to unite. And we're now [in the Senate] trying to focus on issues that unite.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Issues like school accountability, lower college fees, transportation planning.

Today he's governor. . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Perception always trails reality.

Davis' chief strategist, Garry South: \"I think the world of Brulte. We're honest with each other. He's never sleazed me. I pick his brain. He picks mine.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My only concern about Brulte is he's had such a meteoric rise, he's going to think the next step is running for governor.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not likely.

{"id": "421591042.xml", "text": "<h2>Commentary; SAT's 'Halo Effect' Casts a Long Shadow</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The discussion emanating from the University of California regarding the SAT is an invigorating move for American higher education. It is long overdue. The SAT is ideally viewed as a yardstick of merit. It has been used for decades as a key criterion for admission to four-year colleges and universities. Yet, in reality, the SAT is a poorly defined test that reflects racial and economic privileges. It reproduces sex, race and class inequalities in access to the nation's educational resources that produce wealth and power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT affords a too-easy sorting of students' applications into the categories of admit, maybe admit and don't admit. The problem is that many of the students in the don't-admit category could succeed with flying colors if they were given the chance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The SAT creates a halo effect that colors the more holistic evaluation of applicants' statements of purpose and letters of recommendation. It creates a mind-set that is tough to overcome for students who don't have the \"test-wiseness\" to correctly fill the bubbles on questions that involve obscure vocabulary or reasoning that is embedded in white cultural trivia. Students might be expected to know Shakespeare or Voltaire, but they are safe if they are ignorant of Wheatley or Nkrumah. After more than 20 years of college teaching, I've learned that the single most important criterion for a student's success is his or her motivation and effort, attributes that are untapped by SAT scores.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've seen students with abysmal scores excel and students with stellar ones flounder. For millions of aspiring college students, the SAT tests students on material that they have not been taught. In the context of known racial inequalities in educational opportunity, the use of an inflexible yardstick such as the SAT is inherently racist. Ward Connerly, the regent who has led the movement to abolish <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> at UC and in the nation, suggested that he would not want the banning of the SAT to be a \"proxy\" for racial preferences. But the use of the SAT is, in fact, a proxy for maintaining the racial and economic advantages of rich whites.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard H. Atkinson is correct in casting doubt on the SAT, but he is wrong in suggesting that the SAT II, a subject- matter test, is an improvement. Students are advised to take the verbal and math sections of the SAT II (and a subject area of their choosing), which re-create the same biases as the SAT I. Standardized tests cannot assess merit in the context of non- standardized educational experiences. This is also true for the tests that act as gatekeepers to the professions, the MCAT (for medicine), the LSAT (for law) and the GRE (for the social sciences and humanities).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The under-representation of minorities who face discrimination in undergraduate programs dramatically worsens in graduate schools. Much is at stake in Atkinson's proposal because of the multibillion- dollar nature of the testing and test-preparation industries. Students waste valuable time and money in preparing for exams that are irrelevant to their success or failure in higher education. Students take the tests several times in hopes of improving their scores--a cost that is prohibitive to families that do not have financial resources.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SAT scores are weak predictors of first-year college success, explaining only 10% of the variance in grades, and have virtually no bearing on subsequent success or failure. Other measures of presumed merit, such as grade-point averages, are also problematic. GPAs are inflated by advanced placement courses that may produce GPAs above 4.0. We know that students in predominantly African American and Latino schools have less access to these courses, just as they have less access to books and experienced teachers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a perverse irony, African American and Latino communities support public institutions that they do not benefit from in proportion to their tax dollars. Admissions procedures must eschew criteria that have known biases and incorporate those that allow students' drive and determination to manifest themselves. They should emphasize the more important qualities of critical thinking, intercultural awareness and a healthy skepticism of the so-called knowledge items contained in the SAT.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of spending billions of dollars to exclude students, we should redirect those dollars to create more seats in more universities. At Pitzer College, students, faculty and staff have been engaged in an ongoing dialogue about the merits of the SAT. In a recent opinion study on the matter, the college's constituencies have been nearly evenly divided. Atkinson's bold proposal nudges us in the right direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Halford H.

Eurocentric Americans who oppose reparations for historically oppressed groups can count this new census data as a victory.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not \"beat around the (George) bush\" by pretending that this transparent attempt to pass off racism as multicultural acceptance is a good thing for American society. These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered \"white\" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such. Both my parents identified themselves the same way. However, if I were to get technical--as the census invites me to get- -I would have to check the box that said \"white, black, American Indian and Alaska native.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the white in my bloodline extends from slavery via non- consensual sex, white is still evident in my skin tone. Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages? Do \"blacks\" have to have a close white relative, be raised by one, or simply embrace everyone who has contributed to their genetic makeup in order to qualify for the \"white-black\" box?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of clarity on this question makes the data collected invalid for the purpose of drawing conclusions.

I doubt it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Modern political and economic forecasting is done through socio- economic lines more so than racial lines in today's culture. Perhaps we should abandon race identification altogether and inquire only about religion, education and income levels, all of which give us equally important information without race-baiting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the government clarifies the political need for these new 57 categories, all ethnic groups should continue to identify with the established traditional race categories.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whites are not asked to divide their community into 57 multiethnic groups to better represent their diversity, so minority groups should not be asked to do so either.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Felicia Clark is an educator with the Compton Unified School District</p>\n"}
{"id": "421978637.xml", "text": "<h2>Rehnquist's Mixed Legacy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sixteen men have served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting \"subversive activities\" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given affirmative-action program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most \"activist\" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p>\n"}

But there is no guarantee from Congress that the rest of the project would be fully funded by this 90-10 formula; the indications, in fact, have been to the contrary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I felt it would be instructive if I reproduced here the salient portions of the Transportation Department's spending list. Because of the length of that list, I chose half a million dollars as the cutoff point; those consultants who have received less should not feel slighted at being omitted here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas and subcontractors - the main engineers for the project ... $24,833,500 System Design Concepts and subcontractors - the main consultants, who became part of the state government and directed the project until recently ... $8,671,707</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mueser, Rutledge, Johnston & DeSimone - soil engineers ...  $6,163,184</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardesty & Hanover/Andrews & Clark (joint venture) - preliminary engineering designs ... $698,000</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ammann & Whitney - preliminary engineering designs ... $712,400 Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendorff - preliminary engineering designs ... $858,472 The Port Authority - monitor of a test boring and design consultant work regarding Authority facilities ... $595,625 Warren George Inc. - contractor for test borings ... $2,900,862 Clarke & Rapuano/Venturi Rauch & Scott Brown (joint venture ) - landscape architects for park design ... $995,671 R.T.P.

Unfamiliar with the surroundings in the dark, he bonks his head on the refrigerator and is out cold for three and a half years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he opens his eyes in 1992, refreshed after his long rest, he sees the face of White House chief of staff John Sununu peering down at him. Mr. Bush's first words are ''How fares the nation?''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Everything is in great shape,'' Mr. Sununu reports. ''Peace, prosperity without inflation, the kinder-gentler thing doing fine. One of Millie's grandpuppies just had her first litter, and the Post Office is delivering the announcement cards.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President warily asks for specifics: ''How much does it cost to mail a letter from Washington to California?''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Same as last year,'' shrugs Sununu, ''300 yen.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To discover if such complacency is rampant at the center of power, and to track down the source of a troubling new phrase, I visited Governor Sununu in his West Wing office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is, as they say, sharp. When I recalled hours spent in that corner office with a previous occupant, and added wistfully, ''Say what you like about Haldeman, nobody ever ran into his motorcades,'' Mr. Sununu smiled and replied, ''I'll mention that to Cheney.'' He had caught the obscure allusion to inept Presidential motorcading during the Ford Administration when Dick Cheney was chief of staff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, he is still insecure and wet behind his White House ears. In our interview, which was on foreground, he had his deputy sit in to take notes, sign of a player new to the big leagues and fearful of being misquoted. He had his secretary rush in with a message about being late for a meeting with the President, which he waved off to flatter his visitor but also to impress him with the value of the time being taken up. That hoary heave-ho technique is known to Oval Officiators as ''the 10-minute bounce.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about the perception of leisureliness in governance, the near-palindromic aide offered a fresh metaphor to explain the failure to understand the Bush approach: ''Ours is a different template.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Translation: You can no longer use the Reagan template on the keyboard of power. (A template in this sense is a plastic instruction sheet cut out to overlay the computer's keys.) The Bush template reflects a different processing system: if you hold down Alt and push F9, you will now get conciliation where you used to get confrontation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I take this to mean, for example, that the deal made with Speaker Wright to keep the contras fed while giving a policy veto on Nicaragua to Congress would be an unprincipled cave-in on the Reagan template, but is a net pragmatic gain on the Bush template.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief of staff ''had a little chat with'' Boyden Gray about the way the President's counsel, shut out of that Baker-Sununu-Scowcroft project, objected publicly. I think Mr. Gray was right in trying to stop an evisceration of Presidential power, but Mr. Sununu disagrees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was not trapped by what was artfully presented as a linguistic question. The phrase enhanced rescission is being whispered in the corridors of power. Sounds like a tricky euphemism; what does it mean?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's an alternative to the line-item veto,'' he said, suggesting Bob Dole as the best source about that, I presume to avoid letting it appear to be an executive initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power to impound - to not spend - funds appropriated by Congress was taken away from a weakened President in 1974; Mr. Reagan's counterattack, the line-item veto, never had a chance of passage. That leaves a middle ground of ''rescission,'' or getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations, to be ''enhanced'' by making unnecessary the current affirmative legislative action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The upshot would be a substantial giveback of executive authority, as evidence that the Tower appointment precedent and the contra-veto usurpation were not waves of the future. It would show, too, that the Bush White House was effectively at work behind the scenes, progressing without grandstanding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will Mr. Sununu and budgeteer Dick Darman win this for President Bush? I don't see how, if their standard becomes a white feather on a flapping doormat, but for my different template, I am willing to plunk down about 300 yen.</p>\n"}
{"id": "431493919.xml", "text": "<h2>A Lesson In Bigotry And Liberty</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p>\n"}
{"id": "431879654.xml", "text": "<h2>Polishing Columbia's Bad-Neighbor Image</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MEDICAL facilities that ignore poor people. Neglectful landlords. Battles over minority enrollment. In the imagination of many liberal New Yorkers, private universities like New York and Columbia are often at odds with struggling communities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Dr. Allan J. Formicola to contradict the usual image. Retiring this month after 23 years as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, Dr. Formicola, 61, used his position to attract minorities to the dental school and to bring high-quality dental care to Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola, a man with two wings of curly salt-and-pepper hair and a warm  manner, achieved this partly through a personality that makes him as comfortable in a boardroom as on a street corner. He reached out to minority alumni, some of whom had felt isolated at the dental school. At a time of falling enrollment at dental schools nationally, he sold Columbia on encouraging new black and brown faces and more local involvement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The grandson of Italian immigrants, Dr. Formicola was only 38 when he arrived at Columbia in 1978. But his resume included a stint in the late 60's teaching at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a city infamous for its treatment of black people. He describes himself as someone who was always enamored of the ideals of the Great Society and the civil rights movement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''He's got a tremendous amount of respect from the people in Harlem,'' said Paul Dunn, vice president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. ''He's a man who's had a lot of vision and a lot of commitment to bringing people together and building bridges.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia and Harlem, in particular, have had a fractious relationship. Most famously, the 1968 student protest was sparked by Columbia's plan to build a gym in Morningside Park. Recently, Columbia's Morningside Heights neighbors took the university to court over plans to build faculty housing and an elementary school on West 110th Street.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dental school, founded in 1852 and incorporated into Columbia in 1917, had its own history, mostly of indifference. Only 13 blacks graduated from the the school between 1923 and 1980. Dr. Formicola helped enhance minority enrollment to the point that out of a student body of about 300, each class has 6 to 10 blacks and 6 to 8 Latinos. Also under his guidance, Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood now have three community health centers, dental clinics in seven neighborhood schools, and a van offering dental care to children and the aged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Formicola's achievements are an implicit answer to a question behind the never-ending debate about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and other issues involving inequality: what do those in power owe those on the other end?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's hard to say when you're sitting in the midst of a community in need that our mission should be research and education,'' Dr. Formicola said as he sat in his immaculate office in Washington Heights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia's dental school now leads the nation in projects like community partnerships for clinics, said Dennis Mitchell-Lewis, an assistant professor at the school and the director of many of the outreach efforts. ''Dean Formicola has changed everything,'' Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said. ''He added community service to the mission of the dental school. He has a unique way with people. I've had him on 127th Street at 7:30 p.m, meeting with 14 women from a women's group from a little church.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Albert Thompson, a black graduate now in private practice in Manhattan, was one who answered Dr. Formicola's call in 1978 to help recruit minority students, faculty and administrators.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all the attention paid to drawing minorities into the professions, fewer than 5  percent of American dentists are black. And yet minority graduates are more likely to go to work in minority neighborhoods, where inadequate dental care remains a problem, resulting in everything from children with excessive cavities to disparities between white and nonwhite survivors of oral cancers. There are still no pediatric dentists or oral surgeons in private practice in Harlem, Dr. Mitchell-Lewis said, even as research shows a link between oral health and heart disease, diabetes and premature babies. ''We are still at the beginning,'' he added.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question now is whether the successes achieved under Dr. Formicola will continue. ''He's created the template,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''Hopefully, Columbia will continue the legacy.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Mark Matcho)</p>\n"}

That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad was \"kinda stupid.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with Newsweek's Jonathan Alter: \"It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"John's eaten up with envy,\" said one. \"His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Now somebody else is the celebrity,\" the colleague continued, while John looks in the mirror and sees his face marred by skin cancer and looks at the TV and sees his dashing self-image replaced by visions of William Frawley, with Letterman jokes about his membership in the ham radio club and adventures with wagon trains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama \"hasn't bled.\" He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to \"brush him back.\" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. \"I guess I beaned him instead,\" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter. McCain knows he's the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> scion of admirals who might not have gotten through Annapolis without being a legacy. Obama didn't even tell Harvard Law School that he was black on his application.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain upbraids Obama for being a poppet, while he's becoming a puppet. His mouth is moving but the words coming out belong to his new hard-boiled strategist, Steve Schmidt, a Rove protege, nicknamed \"The Bullet\" for his bald pate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schmidt has turned Mr. Straight Talk into Mr. Desperate Straits. It's not a good trade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "759996654.xml", "text": "<h2>High-tech lynching, redux</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1991, the world divided itself into two camps: those who believed Anita Hill and those who didn't. I fell somewhere in the middle: She may have told the truth, but so what?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On bended knee, give thanks if you are too young to remember. A brief summary: Hill testified that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her by verbally sharing his enjoyment of porn films and his sexual proficiency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, yawn if you must. This was scandalous, of course, because . . . well, I'm still not certain. You see, to be scandalized, one must be deeply sensitive to the mention of anything sexual. Indeed, in this case, one needed to be scandalized for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hill's testimony came several years after she worked for Thomas at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where the alleged harassment took place. In other words, she didn't protest at the time of these conversations, which were boorish, assuming they happened as she described. Or were they merely lame attempts at humor?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The context has never been clear. In any case, other options available to Hill included telling Thomas to get over himself. Or, at the very least, assuming deep offense, complaining to a higher authority. She did neither, apparently.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing was mentioned until Thomas was nominated to the highest court. Would an African American nominee of the liberal persuasion have been subjected to the same kind of interrogation? Only as precedent to riot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Thomas's \"offense\" had nothing to do with whether he did or did not say something off-color to a subordinate. Rather, his offense was being a conservative black man who had the audacity, among other things, to suggest that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> ultimately might do harm to those it was intended to help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now we are revisiting the Thomas hearings, sadly owing to the poor judgment of his wife, Ginni. As all surely know, she recently called Anita Hill and left a voice mail suggesting that Hill apologize for what she did. This jaw-droppingly odd lapse has prompted an unwelcome and sordid review of the past and a deluge of theories to explain Ginni Thomas's action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one, the same day of the phone call, a story ran on the front page of the New York Times about Ginni Thomas's new nonprofit group, Liberty Central, which aims to organize the Tea Party movement. She was trying to monetize the moment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's put a pause on nonsense and concede that the Thomas affair remains a painful memory and maybe, just maybe, the justice's wife needs resolution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, a new player has emerged in the drama: Lillian McEwen, a former Thomas girlfriend from way back, has decided that now is the time to set the record straight. Coincidentally, McEwen is shopping her memoir.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday night, McEwen sat down with Larry King on CNN (where I work) to share her own sexual past with Thomas and her belief that Hill told the truth. She told The Washington Post (where I am a columnist) that Thomas was \"obsessed with porn.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McEwen said she didn't mind the porn, she was just bored by it. She also told King that Thomas, who quit drinking while they were together, became ambitious and obsessed with physical fitness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thomas's history of drinking is no secret to anyone who bothered to read his memoir, \"My Grandfather's Son.\" He is brutally honest about his transformation from an angry boy abandoned by his alcoholic father, his upbringing by his grandfather and the nuns at his little Catholic school, and his battle with his own demons and lonely rages to become a thoughtful man deeply respected by fellow members of the court. As Supreme Court analyst Jan Greenburg wrote in \"Supreme Conflict,\" Thomas is the quiet force on the bench who brings others to change their minds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only the heartless would not be moved by Thomas's description of lying at home in a fetal curl, suffering the public humiliation of his hearing, and recognizing that the only route to survival was humility.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It had long since become clear to me that this battle was at bottom spiritual, not political,\" he wrote, \"and so my attention shifted from politics to the inward reality of my spiritual life.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proud Thomas said during those hearings that he was the victim of a high-tech lynching. Let's hope he has enough spiritual reserve to survive this second lynching  --  and a big enough heart to forgive poor Ginni.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kathleenparker@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "900173941.xml", "text": "<h2>The Ugliness Started With Bork</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Oct. 23, 1987 -- 24 years ago on Sunday -- Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court was voted down by the Senate. All but two Democrats voted \"nay.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is \"to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know.\" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a \"wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation\" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the \"systematic demonization\" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb \"to bork,\" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. \"If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,\" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, \"we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose.\" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as \"a right-wing loony,\" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing \"Robert Bork's America\" as a place \"in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,\" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give \"women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, \"Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability.\" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed \"as an extreme ideological activist.\" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
