Its answer, with some important caveats, has always been yes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was wise to reaffirm this principle on Thursday, ruling 4 to 3 in favor of an admissions process at the University of Texas at Austin that weighs race as one of many factors in filling some spots in its first-year class. The decision was the strongest reaffirmation of the constitutionality of a race-conscious approach in more than a decade, and should be the defining judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court has acknowledged over and over that universities have a compelling interest in achieving the social and educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body. But that precedent has remained under constant attack. The current case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied admission in 2008 and argued that the university violated the Constitution's equal protection clause by discriminating against white applicants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Texas uses two separate methods to achieve greater diversity: First, it automatically offers roughly three-quarters of its spots to students who graduated in the top 10 percent of every high school in the state. (This helps increase diversity because so many Texas high schools are either overwhelmingly white or minority.) The remaining quarter is filled using a \"holistic\" process that considers various factors, including an applicant's leadership qualities, talents, socioeconomic status and race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, rejected Ms. Fisher's arguments and said, \"Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Justice Kennedy cautioned that a university's goals \"must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them,\" and that officials must continue to monitor and change those policies if necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(Only seven justices participated in the ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because of her prior involvement in the litigation as solicitor general; Justice Antonin Scalia, who heard oral arguments in the case in December, died in February.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court considered Texas' holistic approach once before, in 2013, but declined then to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it sent the case back to the federal appeals court to examine more closely the university's rationale for considering race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That type of examination is exactly what the university did, in providing data showing that race-neutral policies were inadequate in achieving a diverse student body, and that the holistic approach made a significant difference. In fact, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, the university has been adjusting its use of race in admissions for 20 years. It developed its current approach in direct response to a 2003 Supreme Court ruling upholding the same process at the University of Michigan law school.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some justices continue to reject any consideration of race in college admissions. Justice Clarence Thomas dismissed the idea that students benefit from a racially diverse learning environment as a \"fchangeish theory.\" Justice Samuel Alito spent 50 pages -- more than twice the length of the majority opinion -- disputing every rationale offered by the university and its supporters. \"This is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> gone wild,\" he wrote, and argued that the top 10 percent plan produced enough diversity on its own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that plan, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent from the 2013 decision, is itself race conscious, since it relies on the existing and extreme segregation of Texas high schools. The holistic approach, on the other hand, considers race as a \"factor of a factor of a factor of a factor.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some insist simplistically that America is already a colorblind society or, even more perversely, that ending race-conscious policies would lead the way to such a society. Fortunately, Justice Kennedy, who has long  been a strong skeptic of affirmative-action programs, rejected that view. His vote in the Fisher case assures that universities will continue to have the right to shape their student bodies in a way that better reflects today's America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Lisk Feng)</p>\n"}
{"id": "1878508466.xml", "text": "<h2>What to ask Judge Gorsuch; Look beyond politics and his resume. Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to \"the little guy,\" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an \"originalist,\" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to \"apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, \"text\" and \"history\" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the \"equal protection of the laws\" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an \"originalist\" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated \"well qualified\" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "215497350.xml", "text": "<h2>For the sake of argument</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a great minder of Senate traditions and a stirring elected intellectual, perhaps Washington's last.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he sponsored no major legislation, was not the prophet he thinks he was - and never learned the difference between being right and being effective. By Jacob Weisberg</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India,. his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report - once infamous and now widely praised - on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) - among them, E. B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacque-, line Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough .to have been be-. stowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y, the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of \"ah-ah-ahs\" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, \"In ... what dec-ade ... of this century was the ran-dom patient ... with the random ailment ... encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?\" (His answer: \"Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. .. . Penicillin ... was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people.\") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and \"listening.\" In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New Fronierstan Moynihan serving as an adviser in the Kennedy administration, with Vice President Johnson.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaving the Left</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Robert Kennedy in 1967, the year he called the liberal left \"rigid and destructive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican Interlude President-elect Nixon announcing the selection of Moynihan as his chief domestic policy adviser.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pragmatic Intellectual</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan in 1981, during his first term as senator</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from New York. He was elected in 1976.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls \"the fisc.\" A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: \"You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport.\" With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. \"When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington,\" he wrote, \"one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO BEgan following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. \"Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him,\" the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and naivete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great .Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: \"the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a \"top administration official\": \"Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the \"roll over him\" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, \"I might just hold health care hostage.\" He went on \"Meet the Press\" to declare: \"We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis.\" Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill \"a fantasy.\" Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. \"I probably was more assertive than was in order,\" he says today, with considerable understatement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could - by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of \"cost disease,\" an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he now think he was wrong about all this? \"I guess I was,\" Moynihan told me. \"You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>if he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general - that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battie that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussign of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed - which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals - radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably - by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. \"I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles,\" he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a \"Meet the Press\" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as \"something I should never have done.\" He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: \"Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?\" IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLINTON WHO APpears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What went wrong?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan \"didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy.\" He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his fathey worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign forgovernor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>upstate Retreat</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan at his farm in Pindars Corners, about 70 miles west of Albany. The Irrelevant Senator With President Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clashes with the new administration put Moynihan on the outside in policy formulation, despite the disdain</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>he shared with Clinton for the traditional left.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.AK. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study \"One Third of a Nation,\" which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" a k a the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style - one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a \"matrifocal\" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a \"tangle of pathology.\" One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance \"the stability and resources of the Negro American family\" jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of \"community action,\" which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics,. many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was \"blaming the victim\"; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest - Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson - Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. @km- Wing the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change - at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. \"The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive Continued on Page 68 as any force in American life,\" he wrote in Commentary in 1967.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senior Statesman Moynihan walking the halls of Congress with Senator Patrick Leahy last year. After 24 years in the Senate, Moynihan did not seek reelection to a fifth term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER ROBERT Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvardpedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor famfly. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup - presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote \"The Politics of a Guaranteed Income,\" his longest and most serious book, lay.ing. the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. \"The time may have come,\" he noted, \"when the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign neglect.\"' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless - at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunety. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, \"The United States in Opposition.\" The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a \"racist murderer.\" This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more selfcritical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory. EARLY ON, HE EStablished what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to, his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.LA.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, \"Came the Revolution,\" Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that \"something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before.\" In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. \"I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,\" Moynihan said. \"One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years - and the record holder at four years on the job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-asyou-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as \"the Mexican ambassador\" (as in, \"don't bother him he's with the Mexican ambassador\").</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, \"Pat.\" Moynihan described himself as having \"almost first-class critical intelligence\" but \"secondclass abilities.\" This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of ED.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,\" says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. \"Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS HE APPROACHES REtirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, \"Miles to Go,\" fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (\"We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!\" Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse - something that can be said for what other senator of his time?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,\" says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. \"But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says much the same thing. \"The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,\" he told me. \"The other side really doesn't have anything to say.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old afterhours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has \"lost touch.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Television has emptied the Senate floor,\" Moynihan says. \"That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,\" says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock. That might be taken as a depressing valedictory for a politician who has squandered a vast influence. But what a sad comment, too, about the United States Senate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jacob Weisberg is chief political correspondent for Slate.

But I remember none in modern times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans, members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make student loans -- $692 million to one company alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They bleat about states' rights.

Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal commentator, put it exactly: ''The Senate's vote and the smearing of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.''</p>\n"}

{"id": "2414754878.xml", "text": "<h2>Roberts to Trump: Don\u2019t Take the Supreme Court for Granted</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week of decisions contained hidden and not-so-hidden messages from the court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suppose there had been a leak from the Supreme Court early Thursday morning: The court was about to issue its long-awaited decision in the DACA case on the fate of nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers; the vote was 5 to 4; and the majority opinion was by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the leaker didn\u2019t know, or wouldn\u2019t say, which way the case came out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

There\u2019s no official definition cast in bronze at the state Capitol in Sacramento.

Open land!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only in the last half a century have California\u2019s leaders started to rein in the predation by protecting the state\u2019s natural resources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet many of the leading Republican recall candidates seem to have no interest in maintaining the climate or environmental goals supported by this governor and are more inclined to seek policies that would make things worse \u2014 much worse. Several candidates have said, for example, they would seek expanded oil drilling and fracking operations, encourage more logging of forests and suspend environmental rules wholesale.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are already losing much of the beauty of California and its flora and fauna to the poor choices made by decades of short-sighted leadership. If we lose much more, it may not be worth saving.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, tolerance and equality</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From its early days, California has represented a meeting and mixing of peoples, a destination for risk-takers and refugees, entrepreneurs and escapees. But it hasn\u2019t been a bastion of tolerance and equality for most of its existence, as evidenced by the displacement of Indigenous communities, the embrace of the racist Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and ballot-box assaults on immigrant rights in 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in 1996 and same-sex marriage in 2008. But over the last decade, California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality that inspires the rest of the nation and, indeed, freedom-loving peoples everywhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the policies sometimes swing too far, such as when the Legislature banned travel by California state employees to states that passed anti-LGBTQ laws or when the governor bent over backward to ensure equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and ended up only temporarily delaying the rollout? ? Perhaps, but those are rare examples.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts the state has taken under Newsom\u2019s leadership to reverse discriminatory polices and ensure equal access \u2014 such as reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately affects people of color and supporting the creation of a panel to examine reparations to Californians descended from enslaved people \u2014 are at risk. We fear the state\u2019s position as a fighter against intolerance will end if Newsom is recalled, as many of the leading Republican recall candidates deny that racial discrimination and inequality even exist.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Embracing democracy</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Republican legislatures and governors in other U.S. states have passed laws to make it harder for citizens to vote, California has gone about as far any state to expand access to the franchise. (Colorado, which pioneered many of the voting reforms California adopted, is another.) It did this by adopting automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, early vote centers and generous grace periods for late ballots.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it is the misuse of the state\u2019s generous support of citizen engagement \u2014 its direct democracy system that allows the citizens to make and repeal laws, and to remove elected officials \u2014 that has led to this threat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least one of the recall candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), told the Los Angeles Times editorial board he supports voter ID, which is one of the main ways that Republicans in other states have sought to suppress voting among communities of color.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Support for the marginalized</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is an extravagantly wealthy state. But it\u2019s also a land of searing inequality and entrenched poverty. Homeless encampments and shantytowns should be an eternal source of shame. Caring for the state\u2019s inhabitants in need, regardless of their economic situation or immigration status, is one of the most fundamental of California values.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What this means in practical terms is an expansion of the safety net such as the state has done, including providing relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring sick pay for workers and pouring billions of the state\u2019s budget surplus into programs that help and house the unsheltered.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This also means continuing to reverse decades of counterproductive criminal justice efforts that have resulted in excessive sentences and crippling, unnecessary costs \u2014 on taxpayers, on communities struggling to recover from crime and on offenders who have learned their lesson and want to live responsible lives but remain stuck in prison.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newsom understands this. But if he is removed, would his successor? Probably not. Most of the recall candidates think the criminal justice reforms should be stopped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do we know these are values shared by Californians? Simple. These changes did not happen organically; they were shepherded by elected officials, such as Newsom, who were supported by a majority of Californians.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, what\u2019s on the recall ballot is the most important value of all: democracy.</p>\n"}

And I\u2019m not the only one.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than two decades, I've tried to make sense of political currents in both parties, often to the consternation of readers on both sides. I've been called a corporatist and Republican apologist; more often, I'm called an elitist who pumps out Democratic talking points.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all that time, I have not felt as utterly repulsed from the mainstream of both parties as I do right now. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job \u2014 a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich \u2014 who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote \u2014 that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did. For me (and probably a lot of suburbanites voting this fall), this is more than a backdrop to his presidency. It's a dealbreaker.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their zeal to beat back Trumpism, the loudest Democratic groups have transformed into its Bizarro World imitators. Tossing aside ideals of equal opportunity and free expression, the new leftists obsess on identity as much as their adversaries do \u2014 but instead of trying to restore some obsolete notion of a White-dominated society, they seek vengeance under the guise of virtue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the bibles of this movement is a book called \"How to Be an Antiracist,\" in which Ibram X. Kendi declares: \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not \u2014 as the celebrated author claims \u2014 an expression of support for Lyndon B. Johnson-style <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, which still makes sense to me. It is a case for the kind of social upheaval that occurred when foreign empires relinquished their colonies. It does not end well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals used to believe in civil debate about such ideas. But now, the arbiters of language are constantly issuing Soviet-style edicts about which terms are acceptable and which aren't (\"woke\" was okay, now it's not) \u2014 a tactic used for controlling the debate and delegitimizing critics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can disagree about whether this radical uprising is necessary or politically self-destructive. But it's clearly not in keeping with the principles that are supposed to unite the country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was taught \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that in the United States, we are bound not by common origin, language or culture but by a series of laws and values that make us who we are.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as you swear allegiance to those laws and values \u2014 racial equality, free speech, unfettered worship \u2014 then you're no more or less American than anyone else, and no less deserving of respect, protection and opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That we've failed to honor that promise over the life of the country, and are failing still, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and abandon the project. It means you rededicate yourself to the ideal of true equality, rather than reducing individuals to a box on a census form.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the ideology that both parties used to call liberalism. There is no longer room for it in today's stark political dichotomy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, it's a testimony to the damage that one shameless and unprincipled man managed to wreak on our politics. Trump always had a talent for bringing out the worst in everyone; more than a year after leaving office, he remains the decaying star by which everyone else in our political solar system must orient themselves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also the result of an antiquated primary system \u2014 at the presidential level and below \u2014 that plays to an ever-winnowing group of fervent believers in both parties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more people grow disgusted with extremist party politics, the more only those extremists are heard and the more power they exert on anyone who wants to run for higher office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is about the point where some (most likely some in my own business) will scream: \"Both sidesism!\" That's the now-cliche argument that any criticism of Democrats whatsoever must be some kind of journalistic reflex to equate the parties, when clearly one is worse than the other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is worse than the other. But that doesn't mean we have to feel jazzed about supporting a party that would grade our worthiness as people on a sliding scale of identity. It doesn't change the fact that the broad center of the American electorate \u2014 traditional conservatives and liberals both \u2014 no longer has a political home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where do we go?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, I've predicted the eventual triumph of an independent president, outside the two-party system.

What I do know is that politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum \u2014 and, one way or another, a force will arise to fill the space at the eye of our destructive political storm.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until then, you can call me a dissenter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "2633115690.xml", "text": "<h2>Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s racist killers are grotesque, but their \u2018hate crimes\u2019 prosecution was a show trial</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If fractious Americans can agree on anything nowadays, it should be that the punishment of thought crimes is the odious essence of totalitarianism. So, consider the constitutionally dubious conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's three murderers for having committed \"hate crimes.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The criminal justice system has now correctly concluded that his murderers were racists whose racism manifested itself in their actions. This conclusion, however, does not justify complacency about deciding that because the killers' gross acts reflected grotesque thinking, the thinking merits its own punishment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The killers chased Arbery \u2014 a Black jogger in a White neighborhood \u2014 and killed him with a shotgun. For this violation of Georgia's law against murder, a state court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Then this week, they were convicted in a federal court of violating a federal law that punishes those who violate a person's civil rights \"because of\" their \"race, color,\" etc. For this they can again be sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Jacob Sullum, senior editor of Reason, notes: It is therefore \"equally true that the defendants were convicted 'because of' their benighted beliefs. Condemning them as bigots was the whole point of this exercise, since they had already been condemned (and punished) as murderers.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This misuse of judicial proceedings was, Sullum says, possible because of two regrettable Supreme Court conclusions: The killers' \"second, symbolic prosecution did not amount to double jeopardy, because the state and federal crimes, defined by two different 'sovereigns,' are not 'the same offense.'\" And prosecutions of hate crimes are deemed consistent with the First Amendment, even if they impose added punishment for speech that, however scabrous, is nevertheless constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, the government can conduct trials for the purpose of virtue signaling \u2014 to announce, however redundantly, that it condemns particular frames of mind. A bigot's shabby mental furniture is, however, not a crime. Were it, what other mentalities might government decide to stigmatize by imposing special punishments? Arbery's killers had expressed their racism in speech (texts, social media posts, remarks) that no jurisdiction can proscribe. But their federal punishment will be imposed precisely because their speech demonstrated their bigotry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Proving the intent behind a criminal act is crucial. And no principle should prohibit ever making punishment proportional to the motive for a criminal act. However, deciding that an actor's heinous behavior is made more heinous because they had a bad attitude is dangerous. It is one thing for the law to hold individuals responsible for controlling their minds, which presumably control their bodies. It is quite another thing for government to inventory an individual's mind for the purpose of declaring how admirable the government's mind is, and perhaps by doing so to improve the public's mind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This impulse melds with what C.S. Lewis called the remedial theory of punishment, whereby government detains offenders until they are cured, as determined by government's \"official straighteners.\" Another totalitarian temptation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only an engaged judiciary vigorously applying constitutional protections prevents the woke from greasing this nation's slide into something like Europe's increasingly minute supervision of speech \u2014 and of the mentalities speech reflects. The European Court of Human Rights says governments may \"sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred.\" By \"even prevent,\" the ECHR evidently extends permission for preemptive censorship and punishment. Based on what?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In today's America, \"hate speech\" has become an elastic concept stretched to encompass any expression of ideas \u2014 e.g., opposition to race-based <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> or saying marriage should be between a man and a woman \u2014 that offends any of the plethora of easily offended factions. So, various colleges and universities have proscribed speech that might \"annoy or otherwise inconvenience\" anyone, and certain \"attitudes,\" and \"verbal harm\" from injurious \"assumptions\" or \"implications.\" They have guaranteed \"freedom from indignity of any type\" and protection from \"patronizing remarks.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional grandstanding includes the promiscuous multiplication of federal crimes, many of them duplicative of state crimes. From Congress's bottomless moral pork barrel comes proposals for niche hate crime legislation: The latest, the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, was signed into law May 20 last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government is failing conspicuously at many basic things \u2014 budgeting, preserving the currency's value, maintaining infrastructure, educating children, etc. Surely government should economize its exertions by not conducting show trials for the purpose of highlighting \u2014 perhaps for the public's moral improvement \u2014 that it is offended by certain thinking that can precede certain behaviors that are already criminalized and forcefully punished.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2778538694.xml", "text": "<h2>Why I'm Running for President</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America is in the midst of a national identity crisis. We hunger for purpose at a moment when faith, patriotism and hard work are on the decline. We embrace secular religions like climatism, Covidism and gender ideology to satisfy our need for meaning, yet we can't answer what it means to be an American.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party's top priority should be to fill this void with an inspiring national identity that dilutes the woke agenda to irrelevance. Instead, many top Republicans recite slogans they memorized in 1980 or criticize left-wing culture without offering an alternative. To put America first, we need to rediscover what America is. That's why I am running for president. I am launching not only a political campaign but a cultural movement to create a new American Dream -- one that is not only about money but about the unapologetic pursuit of excellence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may seem presumptuous for a 37-year-old political outsider to pursue the highest office in the land, but I am running on a vision for our nation -- one that revives merit in every sphere of American life.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit for who gets to come to America. My parents entered this country legally, worked hard and raised two kids who went on to create businesses that improved the lives of thousands of Americans. We need more immigrants like them, instead of those who break the law when they enter our country. That means securing the border unapologetically and eliminating lottery-based immigration in favor of meritocratic admission.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must embrace merit in who gets to succeed in America. The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn racial preferences in college admissions. As president I will eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> across the American economy. Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 mandates that federal contractors -- which employ approximately 20% of the U.S. workforce -- adopt race-based hiring preferences. Top companies now regularly disfavor qualified applicants who happen to be white or Asian-American, which spawns resentment and condescension toward black and Hispanic hires. I will rescind this executive order and direct the Justice Department to prosecute illegal race-based preferences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must revive merit in who gets to govern in America. Democracy depends on a simple principle: The people we elect to run the government must be the people who actually run the government. The next time unelected bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci or Merrick Garland reach beyond their legal scope, I commit to doing what the president is constitutionally empowered to do: fire them. I will repeal civil-service protections for federal employees, by executive order if necessary, and replace these managerial protections with sunset clauses. If the president can't hold his position for more than eight years, neither should most bureaucrats. I will call on Congress to repeal or amend the 1974 Impoundment Control Act and will stop funding agencies that waste money or have outlived their purpose. I will shut down agencies that can't be reformed and create new ones built from scratch to replace them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit in determining which ideas win in America. The best ideas are born when no ideas are censored. Yet our government pressures technology companies to censor disfavored political speech and gives them special protections to carry it out. Internet companies are bound by the First Amendment when they act in concert with state actors. As Elon Musk did at Twitter, I will release the \"state action files\" from the federal government -- publicly exposing every known instance in which bureaucrats have wrongfully pressured companies to take constitutionally prohibited actions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Viewpoint censorship extends beyond the internet and pervades our economy. If you can't fire someone for being black, gay or Muslim, you shouldn't be able to fire someone for his political speech. I will work with Congress to enshrine political expression as an American civil right, and I will enforce existing civil-rights laws to protect workers from invidious viewpoint discrimination. The federal prohibition on religious discrimination forbids employers from forcing employees to bow down to any religion, including secular ones as defined by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Seeger (1965) and Torcaso v. Watkins (1961). The modern woke agenda in much of corporate America fits that bill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once we revive our national identity around shared principles, we can muster the fortitude needed to defeat the greatest external threat to America: the rise of communist China. Unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, China today powers the modern American way of life. We must declare economic independence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must reclaim global energy leadership by rejecting the demands of a new climate religion that shackles the U.S. and leaves China untouched. We must achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency while vigorously protecting Taiwan. We should prohibit kids under 16 from using TikTok. We must use financial levers to hold China accountable for spawning the Covid-19 pandemic. We must even be willing to bar U.S. companies from expanding into China until its government abandons theft and other mercantilist tactics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can rise to this occasion if we rediscover who we really are. America's strength isn't our diversity but the ideals that unify us across our differences. These ideals won the American Revolution, reunited us after the Civil War, won two World Wars and the Cold War. They still give hope to the free world. If we can revive them, nothing will defeat us.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramaswamy is a co-founder of Strive Asset Management and author, most recently, of \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence\" and \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Ramaswamy for President?

{"id": "293028806.xml", "text": "<h2>At UCI, Worthy Attention to Diversity Chancellor Wilkening's Council Should Solidify One of the University's Selling Points</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC Irvine has spent more than eight months questioning, discussing and surveying its academic community on the question of diversity. Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who assumed the leadership of the campus nearly two years ago, is getting ready to determine who will be on the Diversity Council and what it will do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effort is worthwhile, and its timing could not be better. Last month a regent of the University of California, Ward Connerly, spoke out against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in the community and said he would try to propose a method of ending race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. Although diversity and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> are not the same thing, they do tend to get tangled up in the oft-heated conversations on those topics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A consultant told UCI officials that the campus seems committed to diversity at the top and at the grass roots, but needs more support for the concept in the middle. That will be the job of the Diversity Council.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCI has performed well off-campus in promoting diversity. One example was welcoming Fullerton high school students who wanted to learn more about people from different ethnic backgrounds. Those students then helped launch cultural diversity programs at their school. UCI graduates have been active in fostering diversity as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Huntington Beach, UCI graduate Alma L. Lopez has helped create a large mural at the art center that shows the various cultures in the county.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On campus too UCI has tried to blend students from varying backgrounds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its percentage of Asian students, 44%, is the largest in the University of California system. They benefit from events such as this month's 11th annual Asian Pacific Awareness Conference, which has the praiseworthy goal of explaining differences among the many cultures of Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, one area where the campus needs improvement is increasing the numbers of women and minorities it hires and promotes as faculty members.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since arriving on campus, Wilkening has consistently said she believes UCI's diversity is an asset and a selling point. Those beliefs resonate in the community as well. Last year the Orange County Annual Survey found that nearly four out of five residents said the county needed programs to increase dialogue among ethnic groups. That was a realistic assessment of the need for all residents to get along in an increasingly diverse Orange County.</p>\n"}
{"id": "293295109.xml", "text": "<h2>THE STATE; Politics Rears Its Disruptive Head in UC--and Students Suffer; CAMPUS CORRESPONDENT</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In January 1967, Gov. Ronald Reagan summoned UC President Clark Kerr to a private meeting in a UC Berkeley conference room. Six hours later, the popular and effective Kerr was fired as punishment for his soft stance on the Free Speech Movement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, a shocked Faculty Senate decried the \"repressive political atmosphere\" and worried about its effects on the quality of higher education in California. Students felt betrayed by what they considered Reagan's bald political aspirations. The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper, went so far as to ask: \"Just who runs this university, anyway?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost 30 years later, the UC system faces the same question. This time around, the cause of the trouble is not student protests or a war in Vietnam, but <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. Again, politics has reared its disruptive head in the realm of education, with consequences as troubling as those surrounding Kerr's ouster.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tug-o'-war began last July, when the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring. Regents were immediately accused of using the UC system to further the political ambitions of Gov. Pete Wilson. After all, Wilson and his Republican predecessors had appointed many of their closest allies to the board and his presidential campaign was in need of a boost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The controversial change in policy sent the nine UC campuses into a frenzy. All nine chancellors opposed the resolution, as did every student government. Activists called for non-compliance, culminating in a huge systemwide walkout on Oct. 12. Most important, the Faculty Senate called for the regents to reverse course, contending that their decision violated the concept of \"shared governance,\" in which regents, UC president, chancellors and faculty strive for consensus before major policy changes are set in motion. Enter Richard C. Atkinson.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five months ago, in the midst of the furor spawned by the regents' affirmative-action decision and accusations of political pandering, Atkinson was chosen the new UC president. His first big job was to implement the new policy and draft guidelines that would replace race and gender preferences with socioeconomic criteria.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most introductory political science professors know that if a bureaucracy opposes a new policy directive, that policy will most likely go nowhere. Thus, it wasn't all that surprising when Atkinson announced that he was delaying full implementation of the regents' policy, until fall 1998 for undergraduates, to allow his bureaucracy to come up with suitable alternative guidelines. Like the regents' action in July, politics loomed in the background: While chancellor at UC San Diego, Atkinson was a staunch supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wilson and especially his point man on the Board of Regents, Ward Connerly, contended that, as members of the majority, their policy-making powers were being usurped by the UC president. Atkinson's task, they insisted, was not to interpret their new policy but to enact it, as his job description mandates. Connerly and nine other regents called for a special meeting to review Atkinson's performance--the first such meeting since Kerr's fateful summons in 1967.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The threat was obvious and it worked, just as Connerly and Wilson had hoped it would. Atkinson officially apologized for overstepping his bounds and vowed to step up implementation of the new policies by one semester. The meeting was called off.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The squabbling among the high brass of the university will no doubt continue until the new socioeconomic guidelines are implemented, if ever. Yet, the problem of who is actually running the University of California is one that will probably never be resolved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Doubtless, the regents' action in July was, in part, motivated by Wilson's desire to energize his presidential campaign. But Atkinson's decision was no less political. The difference is that the regents have the state Constitution on their side.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state of California gives the regents full power to set policy and conduct all business relating to the university. The UC president, even though he sits on the board as one of its non-appointed members, is delegated the responsibility of enacting the will of the body as a whole. In this case, Atkinson had no right to go over the regents' head, and after realizing this, he retreated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the larger issue here is the consequences that this political battle will have for the university as it prepares to educate a new generation of students. After all, the regents' new policy also calls for more outreach programs to help increase the eligibility rates of underprivileged high school graduates, programs that cannot receive proper attention while the office of the president irons out its \"bureaucratic problems.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It will be the students who suffer most for the drawn-out arguments among Wilson, the regents and Atkinson. And the problem couldn't be happening at a worse time. The regents have given the university an opportunity to fix a systematic race bias and replace it with a program that will reward underprivileged students of all races and place them on the road to success. What's now needed are leaders who will steer our university into the next millennium, not stall it in the fast lane.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: MATT MAHURIN / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Matt Belloni, a junior majoring in political science and Spanish at UC Berkeley, is the opinion-page editor of the Daily Californian the independent student newspaper</p>\n"}
{"id": "307867242.xml", "text": "<h2>Affirmative Action's Limits . . .</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> is a program defended in the name of equality whose actual purpose is to redistribute inequality. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> does not seek a general expansion of incomes or opportunities. Rather, it tries to achieve a different apportionment of existing opportunities. It's the classic zero sum game.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> does not reduce the disparities between those at the top and everyone else. It effectively accepts those disparities and looks instead at whether the racial, ethnic and gender makeup of the people who hold coveted positions fairly reflects the makeup of society.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> is different from traditional redistributive programs, most of which involve spending sums of money. With the old-fashioned programs, you can split differences with relative ease. If we're arguing about how much money to spend to help the handicapped, the unemployed, the elderly or the very poor, you and I might propose different amounts. It's not so hard to agree on a number in between, or to compromise on how the taxes to pay for such programs should be apportioned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But you can't split differences so easily with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, because by definition it's applied to each individual job or college spot. Either you get it, or the other guy (or woman) gets it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the older redistributive programs defined groups not in terms of who they were (African Americans, women, Latinos), but rather by what their condition was (for example, orphans, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick, students in need of scholarships). Anyone -- of either gender, of any color, of any ethnic group -- might fall into the second set of categories. Programs for the poor or the unemployed may well set off fights between the lucky and the unlucky, the rich and the not-so-rich. But these are not fixed categories. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span>, on the other hand, rests on fixed definitions of which group you belong to.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the above might be taken as an argument against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. If one's central concern is for a more equitable society, it would seem to make sense to direct government-backed efforts not toward entire racial or gender groups but toward all those, no matter what group they belong to, who need the most help. Surely, for example, it makes more sense to direct resources and preferences to impoverished inner-city kids and not to the sons and daughters of the well-off in the black community. And it doesn't seem to make sense to give, say, the daughter of the president of a steel company a preference over the son of a white janitor at the same steel company. Cases like that may not be typical, but they are relevant to the issue of whether <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> is always just.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But matters do not stop there. The reason this issue is so hard was summarized by the sociologist Steven Lukes in a brilliant adage. \"Every way of seeing,\" he once wrote, \"is also a way of not seeing.\" So, for example, if you focus only on the injustices of class, you might well miss the injustices of race or gender. It is perfectly reasonable for an African American, even an affluent African American, to argue that the burden of discrimination he or she faces is qualitatively different from what might be faced by the white janitor's son. After all, the United States has been firmly committed by law to racial equality for only 31 of the 208 years that have passed since the adoption of a Constitution that permitted slavery. There is, to put it mildly, a lot of catching up to do, and the country clearly has an interest in making sure that African Americans have a good chance of inclusion at all levels of society.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Glazer, a sociologist who has been one of the most articulate opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, surprised many with an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal last week warning that simply wiping out <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> could have disastrous consequences. \"I am concerned,\" he wrote, \"that African-Americans will see the abandonment of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> for them as a terrible rejection by an indifferent and hostile society.\" Would they be entirely wrong?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the coming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> debate is to be something other than demagogic, each side needs to honor the other's truths. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> need to recognize that the standard they espouse, \"equality of opportunity,\" is not nearly as simple as it sounds. Guaranteeing equality of opportunity as between a very poor African American in the inner city and a well-off white suburbanite is a very big commitment involving all sorts of interventions (from prenatal care to adequate policing to decent schools). If you're for equality of opportunity, you have to be in favor of doing a lot more than is now being done to achieve it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> have to understand its limits. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> is doing very little to help those inner-city kids whose problems are now the largest cause of racial inequality. And supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> should not write off as racism or sexism the concerns that whites of modest means have over what <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> might do to their children's chances of advancement. Such concerns are rooted in rational worries about economic conditions that may make their kids' way harder than it would have been 30 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton is thinking about naming a blue-ribbon commission to study <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. If the commission is going to hand out a moralistic report telling us all how to think, it shouldn't waste its time. But if it sees its job as broadening the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> debate to a discussion of how to ensure something closer to equality of opportunity -- for an inner- city child and that white janitor's son alike -- it might do some good.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398441227.xml", "text": "<h2>Affirmative reaction</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Court cases percolate all over America, but California has staked out political leadership of the drive to take the spoils out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts there are occurring on three fronts -- at the University of California, in the legislature and through the initiative process. None, however, is assured of success.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who happens to be black and also a longtime friend of Gov. Pete Wilson, raised the issue of admissions quotas again last month, attracting considerable media attention. Mr. Connerly, who last year objected because some minority-group members apparently were \"admitted almost solely on the basis of race\" to the prestigious university's medical schools, this time widened his focus to the undergraduate enrollment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the June regents meeting, he asked administrators to consider alternatives to race-based admissions and to review federal laws and regulations that may constrain the UC. Mr. Connerly's direction, however, is clear: He doesn't like masked forms of \"government redistribution that takes from one and gives to another.\" He wants, instead, to \"market\" the university to groups that are underrepresented in the student body and assist them in preparing for application. As far as race and sex are concerned, that'd be it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Connerly makes his living as a consultant to public agencies and other entities, especially those concerned with land use, which is what brought him and Mr. Wilson together when they both worked in the statehouse two decades ago. He says he has never used minority set-asides to get contracts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Mr. Connerly's been a rather lonely voice on the regents. \"We need to put a little fiber in people who don't want to be perceived as racists or Uncle Toms,\" he says of his fellow board members, nearly all of them appointed by Republican governors. \"We're now at the point where the returns we're getting from this (preference policy) are little, but they come at a very high price.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That cost is the increasing bitterness of white and Asian-heritage students who find that merit isn't enough in what was long an objective process. On the other side, however, adamant defenders of quotas will spare nothing to defend their beachhead at the UC. In recent years, the legislature has passed mandates that the state universities admit in proportion with California's ethnic distribution. (They were vetoed.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legislative politics on this issue may be changing, as bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring and contracting now should get a fuller hearing. The main reason for this is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment flatly outlawing quotas that looms for the 1996 ballot. The legislature, still controlled by Democrats, may wish to pass statutes that steal some of the initiative's thunder while mucking up its succinct clarity with lots of lawyer-like language. Still, the citizen measure's sponsors are willing to go as far in the Capitol as they can.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, they will have to proceed to collect 615,000 valid signatures for a ballot placement next year. While many are predicting a polarizing and victorious campaign that will change the agenda of both state and national races, the fact is that backers face a daunting task. They will need about $1 million to qualify, and then will be up against an opposition including businesses that rely on quotas for their income.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By contrast, supporters are cash poor. Major corporations will sit this one out, fearing a public-relations hit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story of the failed California voucher campaign of 1993 is a reminder of how an underfunded proposal is susceptible to an expensive campaign of harassment and distortion. On the other hand, Proposition 187 this past fall, despite its faults, proved that an inherently popular, grass-roots drive (with gubernatorial support) can win against loud opposition. The Civil Rights Initiative has going for it, at least so far, the quiet support of many moderate Democrats who grasp what the racial wedge is now doing to their party and their society.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In sum, the California ferment stems from a bid to reclaim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>'s original standing: It is a way to boost those who need help competing on what is, at the point of competition, a level field. It's an attempt to pull the idea back from its current emphasis on institutional mandates and return the focus to where it belongs -- on individual achievement.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398530550.xml", "text": "<h2>Quota person</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more we look at President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman to be Labor Secretary the more we wonder what the White House could have been thinking. Amid a campaign-contributions maelstrom, they name a person -- the director of the White House Office of Public Liaison -- who is almost certainly at or near the eye of the storm (yes, we know, she was oblivious to it all, never came in contact, etc.). Now comes evidence of the rankest sort of quota-mongering by the person nominated to head one of the nation's most work-force-sensitive offices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House tells us that the chart below was part of a larger memo created for and \"in consultation with\" a working group headed by Ms. Herman during her White House tenure. The memo is titled \"Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996.\" Its existence was first reported by two weeklies, the Forward and Human Events.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, it is obviously appropriate for the White House to reach out to the African-American community, and aggressively, in a Presidential campaign. What is striking about this chart is the programmatic mind-set it displays. Indeed, the chart is of a piece with the very same sort of document that in August laid out specific quota assignments for delegates to the Democratic convention -- \"adopt and implement <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> programs with specific goals and timetables for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans and women\" (Review & Outlook, \"The Quota Convention,\" 8/26/96).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exculpatory response to all this might be that the Democrats' internal political arrangements are their own business. We agree. The more compelling image to emerge from these practices, however, is that of a party in thrall to its constituent factions' demands, no matter what moderate rhetoric is put out for broader public consumption. Indeed, it was widely reported that Mr. Clinton was under enormous post-election pressure in naming his Cabinet from \"women\" and \"labor\" and \"minorities.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet once Ms. Herman is Secretary Herman we're supposed to believe that all this Democratic reality goes away, that the operative theory is \"mend it, don't end it,\" and that in its formal submissions to the Labor Department Texaco won't have to produce a chart just like the one Alexis Herman generated for the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cases like Texaco's show, the 1990s are turning out to be the decade in which our national controversy over race moves beyond the academy to reside in the corporation. Along with the EEOC, the Labor Department is at center stage. Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regularly polices most Fortune 500 companies on their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> practices; through the federal contract connection, Labor has the power to regulate more than half of the economy. Precisely for these reasons, the Labor Secretary's job should go to someone with great judgment and sensitivity, two traits not obviously in evidence in this nominee.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n"}
{"id": "398538903.xml", "text": "<h2>Useful distinctions</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The phrase \"useful distinction\" seems to have lost its usefulness. It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of \"all or nothing.\" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate. Something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the California Civil Rights Initiative on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly and the other sponsors of CCRI have formed the American Civil Rights Institute to take their initiative campaign against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides nationwide. They're being bitterly opposed by the forces and groups who give the strong impression that merely to raise questions about the status of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> is to commit sin beyond forgiveness. But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's \"minority distress sale policy,\" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises \"complete control over the station's affairs.\" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved \"the important government objective of broadcast diversity.\" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently \"non-minorities,\" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added \"sweat equity\" and that he never gave up control of the company. \"It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,\" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies. But then when a CCRI-like effort emerges, its supporters are attacked as loonies beyond discussion. Under the circumstances, a revival of \"useful distinctions\" looks very much in order.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398630711.xml", "text": "<h2>ABA v. business</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The American Bar Association has gotten a lot of heat, and deservedly so, for its loony forays into non-legal matters. What's the ABA doing supporting abortion rights, endorsing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and now calling for a death penalty moratorium? Congressman Chris Cox wrote a trenchant article for the Weekly Standard recently exposing in detail how the ABA's liberal agenda skews its evaluations of judicial nominees. But another area where the nation's largest organization of lawyers has gone off the tracks hasn't gotten nearly enough attention -- the ABA is actively promoting an anti-business agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same meeting earlier this month where the ABA adopted the anti-death penalty plank, its House of Delegates also endorsed a resolution on class actions. The resolution favors making it easier to certify class actions for settlement purposes, and opposes a proposal to rein in \"coupon\" settlements unless the \"litigation's probable deterrence value\" is taken into account. In other words the ABA thinks the public is being well-served by settlements -- such as those in the notorious Ford Bronco II and airline price-fixing cases -- where the plaintiffs' lawyers reap millions while their ostensible clients collect coupons worth almost nothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nobody should be surprised, since the ABA has a long record of opposing any effort to improve the tort system. According to a summary compiled by the Federalist Society, the ABA opposes a loser pays rule; opposes any limits on pain and suffering awards; opposes a \"ceiling\" on medical malpractice damages; and opposes product liability reform. In effect, then, the ABA wants to let plaintiffs' lawyers continue extorting billions from American companies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As if to add insult to (personal) injury, the ABA has also gone on record  favoring a long list of government mandates on business: universal health care, protection from discrimination for HIV patients, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the like. The group has even called for the creation of \"a federal agency to advocate the views of consumers,\" a long-standing Naderite pipe dream. Is there any pro-business idea that finds favor with the pooh-bahs of the ABA? Oh yes, there is one: The ABA supported Nafta.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ABA resolutions aren't just empty words. The ABA has a corps of paid lobbyists who are authorized to support the stances taken by its House of Delegates. And these lobbyists were active in opposing Republican efforts to pass civil justice reform as part of the \"Contract with America.\" Who can forget the ABA president describing the new GOP Congressional majority in 1995 as \"reptilian bastards.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some will no doubt say: Well what do you expect from a bunch of lawyers? They want to preserve their honey pot, so they don't want to change the tort system. A realistic, if cynical, assessment. But the ABA itself claims that it's not merely a special pleader for lawyers; after all, it somehow finds the moral authority to instruct the rest of America on how to run foreign and social policy. The group even has a quasi-governmental function: It certifies lawyers and law schools, and regulates their conduct. The ABA also formally advises the President and Senate on judicial nominations. By backing the plaintiffs' bar, the ABA is not only casting doubt on its ability to carry out these functions fairly and impartially, but it's also sticking it to a large portion of its membership: lawyers who work for businesses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bunch of Fortune 500 general counsels were sufficiently alarmed about the ABA's drift that they convened a summit meeting last year with the organization's leaders. The powwow didn't accomplish much. The ABA, for instance, still refuses to adopt a proposal limiting contingency fees endorsed by heavyweights ranging from Robert Bork to Robert Pitofsky. This group wants the ABA, which already bars \"unreasonable\" fees, to stipulate that it's unethical for a lawyer to take one-third of a plaintiff's award if the case was so simple that he didn't have to do much work or take much risk. No dice. Apparently the ABA is more interested in opposing nuclear weapons than contingency fees, which happen to be the engine driving much of the liability explosion of recent decades.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But then the ABA doesn't believe there is a liability explosion. Not long ago, the group put out a lengthy pamphlet of \"Facts About the Civil Justice System,\" which claims there hasn't been an increase in personal injury suits. As evidence, the pamphlet points out that tort litigation has slightly decreased since 1990. The brochure doesn't bother to mention another fact: tort filings have increased dramatically since 1984.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such selective use of evidence reveals the ABA's deep and abiding bias in favor of runaway litigation. Given that slant, it's hard for us to see why anybody should take seriously the ABA's opinions on judges or any other subject.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: ABA's Solid Stand On Business Issues\" -- WSJ March 19, 1997)</p>\n"}
{"id": "398730713.xml", "text": "<h2>On Media Bias, Network Stars Are Rather Clueless</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dan Rather has been on television more than usual lately, popping up all over the place promoting his book about American success stories and along the way wearily denying that he's the left-wing devil some conservatives think he is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same old story as far as Dan is concerned. The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imagination. Case closed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, as just about everyone who lives between Manhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening newscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74% of Republicans spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47% of Democrats agreed, believing that \"most journalists are more liberal than they are.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of course, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the news and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. They're denying it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them if there's a liberal bias on their newscasts, they'd all say \"no\" and they'd all pass the test.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . . [a] negative sign on you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words \"left wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with with the anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> or pro-life lobbies?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media elites can float through their personal lives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealthy and sometimes downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the brilliant film critic at The New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Nixon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: \"Nobody I know voted for Nixon.\" Never mind that Nixon carried 49 states. She wasn't kidding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on liberal bias it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and Peter: Stop telling us that we're the problem, and start thinking about what liberal bias really means.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Goldberg was a correspondent for CBS News from 1972 until 2000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Reporters Need Course In Basic Capitalism\" -- WSJ June 5, 2001)</p>\n"}
{"id": "398881739.xml", "text": "<h2>The Incredible Shrinking Kennedy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It could have been a far different election season this fall for Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two summers ago, had Al Gore and his advisers stretched their imaginations beyond the hyperbolic \"ground-breaking\" choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the \"daring\" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's \"short list\" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, \"We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a \"positive\" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that \"Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less.\" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich \"opposes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> based on race,\" she said, \"Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that \"KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election.

{"id": "408345486.xml", "text": "<h2>When the Doors Opened at Central High</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years ago today, nine African American students took a long walk down a short block and integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Ark. Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon this will be true of California. And 40 years from now, there will be no majority race in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can look at statistics and know what America will look like in the 21st century. But we have to look inside ourselves to determine what America will be like in the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president is asking all Americans to join him in a national conversation about race to face one another honestly across lines that still divide us. Clearly, now is the time for honest dialogue, the time to build a society that recognizes the worth of all people and honors the dignity of every person.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until every American has real economic opportunity and first-rate educational opportunity, there will be disparities that will look like racial discrimination, whether they are or not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melba P.

{"id": "408354994.xml", "text": "<h2>The University of Michigan Case</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JENNIFER GRATZ'S lawsuit challenging the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy is a win-win proposition for opponents of affirmative-action programs and a significant headache for their defenders. If Ms. Gratz prevails in the lower courts, the university could be forced to dismantle its program, joining public universities in California and Texas that have adopted race-blind admissions policies and then seen minority enrollments plummet. On the other hand, if Ms. Gratz loses, foes of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> will have the opportunity to challenge the race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court at a time when the high court is notably unfriendly to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> generally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Gratz, who is represented pro bono by the conservative Center for Individual Rights, claims she was discriminated against when she was wait-listed and later turned down by Michigan two years ago because she is white. On its face, she appears to have a strong case. University admissions guidelines seem to instruct admissions officers to handle minority applications differently from those of white applicants, laying out a dual set of standards that could raise a constitutional problem under the Supreme Court's 1978 case University of California Regents v. Bakke. In Bakke, the court allowed race to be a factor in admissions but said it could not preclude any candidate from receiving full consideration. That is precisely what Ms. Gratz alleges happened to her, because the guidelines suggest that comparably qualified minority candidates generally should be admitted. These are disturbing guidelines, and it is significant that the university has since changed its admissions system to one that would be easier to defend under Bakke.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, it would be premature to pass judgment on a complex admissions system before all the evidence is in. It is difficult to demonstrate that any one student was rejected because of race as opposed to the myriad other factors that influence admissions at a large university, and the University of Michigan gives preferential treatment to students on bases other than race. Students from certain counties in Michigan get preferential treatment, for example, as do students whose parents are Michigan alumni. It is not logical to suggest that race can be a factor in admissions but can never play a decisive role in an individual admissions decision. Even a program that meets the Bakke test, in other words, is going to produce certain white victims -- like, perhaps, Ms. Gratz -- so the mere fact that such victims exist cannot necessarily mean that the program is constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The larger question, of course, is whether Bakke even remains the law of the land. Normally, the courts wait for the Supreme Court to renounce one of its own rulings before declaring the ruling dead. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit paid the high court no such deference when it ruled last year that the University of Texas could not use race as a factor in law school admissions. This was, in our judgment, a bad decision that jumped the gun on an important constitutional question. But it is also possible that the decision in Hopwood v. Texas correctly anticipated the direction that the Supreme Court, which declined to review the case, eventually will go on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in education. It is not obvious that this will be the case, however. While the court has narrowed the acceptable uses of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in recent years, the public university is a unique environment -- constitutionally as well as culturally. Allowing a university to foster diversity by factoring race into admissions decisions under certain narrow circumstances still seems to be a constitutional approach.</p>\n"}
{"id": "408366163.xml", "text": "<h2>Foreign Affairs in Annapolis</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was \"a little taken aback\" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. \"You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,\" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, \"MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,\" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as \"enormously secretive and powerful\" and \"a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . \"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the \"tantamount\" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. \"The State Department testimony only helped me more,\" says Baker. \"They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it.\" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p>\n"}
{"id": "408654746.xml", "text": "<h2>Mr. Lieberman's Debut</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOSEPH LIEBERMAN introduced himself to the American people last night, and was introduced by his wife and others, as a classic American story--the first in his family to graduate from college, the son of a father who worked nights and a mother who valued family and education. Much has been made of his status as the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president, but his message was the universality of the American dream and of the values that motivate him--faith, family, hard work, public service, equal opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was an affecting speech, well received in the convention hall. But the senator's challenge went beyond making a good first impression. Some of the very qualities that recommended him to Al Gore also represent sources of tension now that he is on the ticket. His reputation for integrity stems in part from his criticism of Clinton-Gore fundraising excesses and of President Clinton's ethical lapses. His reputation for innovative thinking and bipartisanship stems in part from questioning policies that remain sacrosanct in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Since his selection, the George Bush campaign has even portrayed Mr. Lieberman as closer to its views than to Mr. Gore's--somehow not a real Democrat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So last night Mr. Lieberman portrayed himself as very much in the mainstream of Democratic thinking. He wrapped himself in the language of civil rights and a fair distribution of national prosperity. Whatever differences he might have with some Democrats, he seemed to say--or with Al Gore--pale next to differences between the parties. In so doing, he glossed over some of his past independent stands. There was no mention of President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal, which the senator bravely criticized in the past, nor of the fundraising coffees at the White House, which Mr. Gore attended. Likewise, he endorsed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, which he has questioned, and was mute on tort reform or school vouchers, two policies that Mr. Lieberman has sympathized with. Tort reform is anathema to the trial bar, which donates lavishly to Democratic campaign coffers. School vouchers appall the teachers' unions; teachers account for some 12 percent of the delegates at the convention.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Sen. Lieberman emphasized areas in which he and Mr. Gore agree, such as health care, the Democrats' favorite issue this year. He sought to draw a distinction between Democrats and Gov. George W. Bush on the environment. He warned that the Republicans' tax plans would benefit the wealthy, slighting Social Security and Medicare. And on the crusade against indecency in popular culture, not popular in Hollywood, he claimed kinship with Al and Tipper Gore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lieberman in the past has been refreshingly willing to acknowledge the complexities of issues such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and the failings of public schools. One question now is whether the Gore ticket can offer new ideas without venturing outside the confines imposed by the Democratic Party's core constituents. Education is a test case, even though the federal role in this area is limited. Mr. Lieberman avoided the radioactive subject of vouchers, but he did declare that \"schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability.\" That may prove more radical than it sounds, depending on how it translates into policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats have held the White House for two terms in part by convincing Americans that they are the party that fights, as Mr. Lieberman said last night, to find \"room for everybody\" around the table of American prosperity. But they also have succeeded by separating themselves enough from their traditional positions to look fresh. They have become the party of fiscal responsibility and are willing to see that government programs must be enlivened with new management styles (hence Mr. Gore's talk of reinventing government) and with competition (hence the Democrats' support for charter schools). This openness needs to be preserved. \"We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree,\" one speaker declared on Tuesday night. That speaker was Jesse Jackson, in some ways the champion of traditionalists.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409108213.xml", "text": "<h2>Two Little Words: (1) Advice, (2) Consent</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives believe that every word of the Constitution should be \"strictly construed\" according to its \"plain meaning\" and the \"original intent\" of the men who wrote it. Every word, that is, except two: \"advice\" and \"consent.\" The plain meaning of these words is not hard to fathom, nor is their authors' intent. Senatorial \"advice and consent\" on the president's judicial nominations was a compromise between those who thought the president should appoint judges and those who thought Congress should do it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least when the White House is Republican and the Senate is Democratic, however, conservatives discover all sorts of doctrines in the word \"consent\" that are far from clear to the naked eye. Senators musn't consider the nominee's ideology. They must never ask or consider how the nominee might vote on specific issues or cases. As for the word \"advice,\" fuggedabadit. At Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Tuesday about standards for approving judicial nominations, all the energy on the conservative side was about piling limitations on the Senate's power of consent. Only a liberal suggested that maybe the Constitution is trying to tell us that presidents should seek the Senate's advice in choosing his nominees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's straighten out a few concepts here. Ideology can mean the sum of your views on all political issues: welfare, taxes, trade with China, etc. Yes, of course, senators should not consider a would-be judge's politics -- except to ensure as best they can that the judge won't consider them either in his or her rulings. But ideology can also mean your specific philosophy on judicial matters: the role of precedent, the meaning of the 14th Amendment, and so on. And senators of course can and should inquire about this kind of ideology and vote yea or nea on that basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives generally accept this distinction. But they muddle it by presenting their own preferred judicial ideology -- a flurry of bromidic phrases: \"judicial restraint,\" \"strict construction,\" \"original intent\" -- as a piety beyond legitimate dispute. So any liberal challenge to a conservative nominee is automatically \"ideological\" in the bad sense, while every conservative challenge to a liberal nominee is based on philosophical principle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conservatives' judicial philosophy is not beyond legitimate dispute. First of all, they themselves happily overlook it when it is inconvenient. \"Advice and consent\" is a ripe example. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative action</span> is another: Conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn policies of the elected branches. They sincerely believe, no doubt, that this is a case where the Constitution speaks clearly and judicial restraint is inappropriate. But that's the point: Their buzzwords don't provide an unfailing guide even for them, let alone a beacon of truth so bright that the path it illuminates is the only one worth taking. Waving a wand called \"strict construction\" can't fully illuminate purposely vague phrases like \"cruel and unusual.\" Invoking \"original intent\" won't tell you what the authors' original intent was about dealing with changing circumstances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If \"advice and consent\" is entitled to anything close to its plain, original meaning, the Senate is perfectly entitled to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject some on that basis. Scrutiny includes asking nominees their views and their reasoning about fairly specific legal issues, if not actual pending cases. Why not? After all, sitting judges write long opinions day after day telling us what they think about many issues that will come up again, but no one regards that as a problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Needless to say, it would be wrong for Senate Democrats to let considerations of sauce for the gander influence their thinking on this issue. President Bush would never let political considerations influence his judicial choices. When he campaigned last fall on a promise to nominate justices like Scalia and Thomas, he must have had in mind some other way in which those two gentlemen are alike.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for eight years of Republican harassment and blocking of President Clinton's nominees, Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed at Tuesday's hearing that this is entirely a figment of your imagination. That's right -- it never happened! His \"proof\": almost as many Clinton nominees as Reagan nominees ultimately got confirmed. Of course this says nothing one way or another about how many were blocked and had to be replaced.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clint Bolick, director of legal affairs for the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy and head of the so-called Institute for Justice, also testified on Tuesday. Bolick noted that his organization didn't oppose any of Clinton's Supreme Court nominees. He did not mention his ferocious campaign against Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's nominee for head of civil rights at the Justice Department. Ordinarily, a president's choices for his own administration are thought to deserve more deference, not less, than his nominations for lifetime appointments to the independent judiciary. But an Institute of Justice press release at the time (1997 again) argued that the advice and consent clause actually obliges senators to oppose nominees with erroneous views \"when the stakes are high enough.\" The stakes in this case were in essence that Bolick's group favored judicial activism -- judges overthrowing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> plans -- and Lee did not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Institute of Justice Web site describes it as dedicated to opposing \"racial preferences\" and \"the welfare state\" and as a \"courtroom champion\" for \"free market solutions and limited government.\" But Bolick testified Tuesday that \"mere philosophical differences\" shouldn't play a role in the Senate's approval of judges -- and, what's more, they never had. To start now would be \"a sea change,\" he said. Bolick quoted Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy in 1997 denouncing the practice of \"blue slipping\" -- individual senators blocking judicial nominees from their state.

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,\" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,\" Garrow said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The court operates according to a different rule,\" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. \"There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,\" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. \"He may still be finding things out himself.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's \"median voter,\" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, \"the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.\"</p>\n"}

The mayor of New York City, the governor of the state, the secretary of labor, famous actors, writers and ministers were among those who surfaced at New York's Riverside Church.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For sure, that was a sharp contrast to the 1965 funeral of her husband. Only a handful of prominent people surfaced for that, with many of the absences, including of civil rights leaders, notable and intentional.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The memorial for Shabazz was in sync with her exemplary life. Widowed at age 28, she was a mother of six daughters who later went on to earn a doctorate, become a college administrator and be an elegant civil rights proponent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the staff writer Hendrik Hertzberg suggest, her passing is a reminder of stresses within the black community over integration. There is ferment which expresses chagrin with the failure of busing to redress segregation in schools or improve the quality of education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shabazz was the \"unflamboyant carrier of her husband's political legacy,\" which repudiated the racial animus of the Black Muslims but at the same time did not embrace integration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And while the \"separatism associated with the name Malcolm X is not part\" of an emerging black consensus, which supports integrated workplaces and admits that \"not every black problem is the result of white racism,\" Malcolm X's hopes that blacks would play much bigger roles in society are.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The mourners at his widow's memorial service may symbolize those hopes, even as the manner of her death--with its echoes of the troubled family lives of so much of the black underclass--symbolizes one of the major threats to their fulfillment,\" the duo writes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"That separateness led to inequality was the great theme of the civil rights era.

{"id": "418768610.xml", "text": "<h2>USDA SETTLEMENT ADVANCES ARGUMENT FOR REPARATIONS</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the public's attention was diverted by the partisan spectacle unfolding in the U.S. Senate, something just as momentous happened on the other end of Washington: The federal government agreed for the first time since Reconstruction to pay reparations to African-Americans for the damages of past racism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A federal judge tentatively approved an agreement requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to black farmers because of the government's history of racial bias. The historic ruling settled a 1997 class-action lawsuit initiated by more than 1,000 black farmers that charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The settlement requires the USDA to provide at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who it agrees were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. One provision of the agreement also requires the federal government to return foreclosed lands to affected farmers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>African-Americans were 14 percent of American farmers in 1920 and today they are far less than 1 percent, according to John Boyd Jr., of the National Black Farmers Association. Boyd and other black farmers blame the USDA's discriminatory practices for that rapid land loss and several federal probes of the agency have supported those charges.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1982 study by the Civil Rights Commission predicted that black farmers would be extinct by 2000 unless drastic action were taken by the federal government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the 1.4 million people who operated or managed farms in 1995, just 8,000 were black, according to recent figures from the Census Bureau.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Total claims in the recent settlement are expected to exceed $375 million, but the exact figure is impossible to calculate until officials have a better idea of the number of affected farmers. The lawsuit sought $3.5 billion and many farmers are complaining that the settlement is too little too late to be of any real assistance. Despite the inadequacies of the specific settlement, however, it provides the rationale for a more extensive claim of reparations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black farmers initiated the litigation in 1997 after an internal USDA investigation found an entrenched history of anti-black practices, reaffirming what many previous probes concluded. Although the lawsuit focused specifically on the period from 1981 to 1996, it could well have picked any period in American history.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The suit argued that the current economic inequities of black farmers--as a \"class\"--are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias and that financial compensation helps redress the legacy of that history.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That logic also justifies reparations as compensation to African- Americans--as a \"class\"--to help redress 2 1/2 centuries of slavery, a century of official apartheid and decades of de facto discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The accumulation of disadvantages blacks suffered during this period--including a coercive diversion of wealth and cultural capital--provide a compelling explanation for current wealth and health disparities between black and white Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In attempts to redress the damage of that history, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has continuously reintroduced, since 1989, a bill designed to examine slavery's impact on African-Americans. His bill, The Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act, has failed to garner sufficient support and languished in the House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arguments favoring reparations not only are logical, they also offer a welcome respite from the acrimonious debates about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and other preference policies. The cost of federal reparations would be spread throughout the tax system and would be justified by both a cold economic calculus and moral responsibility.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sense of responsibility, for example, helps explain why few Germans complain about their country's payments of more than $100 billion to Israel in reparations for damage done to Jewish victims during the Nazi era.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the federal government issued land as reparations for racism was during Reconstruction, when Gen. O. O. Howard of the Freedmen's Bureau urged ex-slaves be granted \"40 acres and a mule.\" His suggestion was implemented on a tiny scale for a short time only on the Sea Islands, off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, but became a catch phrase for former slaves and their descendants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, halted that experiment in reparations with polices that ended Reconstruction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bill Clinton hailed the recent settlement with his administration as an important step in ongoing efforts \"to redress any harm that has been caused by past discrimination against African- American family farmers.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How ironic that the second president to be impeached has effectively resumed that experiment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: Salim4x@aol.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Margaret Scott.</p>\n"}

Education Today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of diversity has taken on new meaning since Sept. 11.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suddenly from a nation of atomized individuals we became a collective, in fear, mourning and awareness of having a common identity and perhaps a common fate as Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that collective it suddenly seemed very important that we had many kinds of names and faces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of us began seeing faces we hadn't noticed before. Non- Muslims became aware of Muslims as people to be encountered in an emotional, almost intimate way.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On college campuses students began flocking to classes on topics most hadn't much cared about before: Afghanistan, the Middle East, international relations, Islam, Arabic language.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most important, Americans, in looking in each other's faces and hearing each other's prayers, sought a renewed faith that differences of color or religion or ethnic background don't have to lead to implacable enmity and mutual destruction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context it is worth reconsidering the venerable arguments about whether furthering diversity on college campuses constitutes a compelling national interest to the extent that universities should consider race and ethnicity in their admissions policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A series of conflicting court decisions in the last year have brought the debate over what is called the \"diversity rationale\" to a fever pitch, and the U.S. Supreme Court may have the final say. Different federal judges have ruled that race-conscious admissions policies are permissible to foster diversity for University of Michigan undergraduates, but not at the law school.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other jurists have decided that such policies are fitting at the University of Washington law school, but not for undergraduates at the University of Georgia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Implementation of such policies is different at each school, and the varied techniques may have played some part in the decisions. But the arguments on both sides always come back to the issue of whether diversity is a compelling enough interest to warrant going beyond tests and numbers in the direction of race and ethnicity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The diversity rationale has taken the place of another accepted standard--remedying vestiges of past racial discrimination--because past bias is hard to pin down, especially outside the South. Diversity as a positive educational goal, beneficial to all students in an institution, makes a more compelling case.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is of immediate importance only in flagship public universities throughout the country, as other state schools generally admit the vast majority of applicants. Private schools, however, might be held to whatever standard is finally applied.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going to the right college, or to a top law or business or medical school, means a lot in this country. Not everything, fortunately, but still a lot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to insist that merit, determined by the test scores and grades, should be the only admission standard. We are all equal before the numbers, which are blind to color, gender and ethnicity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But merit obviously takes many forms, and numbers themselves can be relative. Is a 1300 SAT score by a New Trier student from a wealthy family really more meritorious than an 1100 by a low-income teenager from the South Side?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clearly there is some lower limit on capability: Students must be able to do the work. And some studies show comparatively high dropout rates for students admitted to selective schools through <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there also is evidence that such students actually do better at top schools than their counterparts (for instance, black students with similar test scores) at less-selective schools.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crucial question is whether, in a world in which pluralistic values suddenly seem so important, the top schools can afford to cut minority admissions. One landmark study says a race-blind policy could slice the number of black students at these schools to as little as a quarter of the current total.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor said in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that she has given the issue a lot of thought.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"How does one see that we're not all the same, that we haven't traveled the same path and that we have to be able to see the world from the other person's eyes? That for me is at the center of why I believe so firmly that higher education has to be diverse,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't naturally come to see other sides; we need to learn how to do that, we need to have the social context and the learning context where we can get outside of ourselves.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after Sept. 11, students felt vulnerable and wanted to reach out to others without quite knowing how, she added. And of course there were ugly incidents, including a brawl in a campus bar after an attack on an Indian student.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What I keep saying at events here is that it's terribly important in a crisis to see people as individuals and not as groups, not as a religion,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"For many of our students, college life is the first time they actually have a chance to live and work in a diverse environment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of the diversity rationale say you can have stimulating, diverse ideas without a diverse student body. Not so. There is no substitute for that direct encounter with someone whose difference is a challenge to the heart and mind.</p>\n"}

The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm not with the city anymore,\" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means \"mushroom\" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a \"City Official A.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any opinions on it,\" Grzyb said. \"I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it. Thank you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,\" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know nothing about it, I tell you,\" Daley insisted. \"I know nothing about it, any other questions?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts.

{"id": "420557855.xml", "text": "<h2>2 more years of endless campaigning; The length of election cycles tests voters' patience, but it also tests candidates' mettle</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>in Britain, Canada and other civilized places, national elections are often called, run and concluded within six weeks. In America, election campaigns go on forever. It used to be one year, now it's two. No one planned this, but like other evolutionary artifacts (the  founders applied intelligent design to the general makeup of the U.S. government but never foresaw formal political parties, let alone the endless campaign), this crazy improvisation embodies a certain wisdom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, it tests a certain kind of competence. Managing a national campaign in a country of continental dimensions requires exceptional organizational skills. A fairly narrow competence, to be sure, but of major importance in a country where the president must run the behemoth that is the federal government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second function of the endless campaign is to build party consensus and democratic legitimacy, both of which contribute substantially to the astonishing stability and longevity of the American system. The presidential primary season is essentially a prolonged intraparty dialogue. It recreates the Madisonian idea of factions and interests competing against each other, applied not to the legislature or the executive, but to the electoral process that produces both. The job of the parties is to create a kind of prelegislative consensus through the competition and conversation of the various factions -- ethnic, ideological, economic, geographic. The purpose of the endless presidential primary is to force the dialogue and, for all its haphazard meanderings and maddening trivialities, it does.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unscripted, of course, and much of it goes nowhere. But not always. Perhaps Barack Obama's suggestion during a television interview that we should be moving away from preferences based on race to preferences based on class will be ignored, but perhaps it will be taken up by an opponent or the media and provoke a historic debate within the Democratic Party on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and a transition to a new national consensus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, Rudy Giuliani wrestles with the abortion issue (and, in the eyes of many, loses). He will be asked the question repeatedly. He will have to answer repeatedly. Should he prevail as the GOP presidential nominee, it will perhaps represent a historic shift in the very self-definition of American conservatism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. Nothing is guaranteed, but we do have the striking example of welfare reform, the most significant social advance of our time. Its political origin was the first presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, who distinguished himself from the field as a New Democrat by pledging to end welfare as we know it -- thus giving him the legitimacy within the Democratic Party to carry out so radical a reform. When serendipity presented him with the Republican Congress committed to the same objective, the reform got done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final function of the endless campaign, and perhaps the most psychologically important, is to satisfy the American instinct for egalitarianism. We have turned the presidential campaign into a pleasingly degrading ordeal -- pleasing, that is, to the electorate. The modern presidential campaign is meant to be physically exhausting and spiritually humbling almost to the point of humiliation. Candidates spend two years and more on bended knee begging for money, votes and a handshake in a diner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why do we inflict such cruel and unusual punishment? Because our winner is not just chief magistrate but king. True, the kingship is temporary, but its glories and perks are beyond compare -- the pomp and pampering of a head of state, married to the real political power of controlling the most important state on the planet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bargain we offer the candidate is this: We will make you Lord, circling celestially above us on Air Force One, but because we are flinty Jeffersonian yeomen, we insist that you flatter us first with a very extended show of camaraderie and commonality with the Iowa farmer, the New Hampshire alderman and the South Carolina good ol' boy. Aboriginal tribes have slightly different rituals for those who pretend to kingship, but the idea is the same: ordeal before dominion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a columnist whose job it is to chart every jot and tittle of these campaigns, every teapot tempest that history will remember for not one second, I curse election years. Now, I have to curse the year before as well. But for all its bizarre meanderings, the endless campaign serves critical purposes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first two -- testing the candidates' managerial and consensus-building skills -- are undeniably useful. But like most Americans, I find it is the third -- the gratuitous humiliation of our would-be kings -- that makes it all worthwhile.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---------- Charles Krauthammer is a syndicated columnist based in Washington.

{"id": "420906077.xml", "text": "<h2>Nonprofits try to improve board diversity</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Phyllis Lockett had all of the right credentials: membership in the Chicago Network and the Economic Club; an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management; board experience at City Year Chicago; and the full-time title of CEO of the Renaissance Schools Fund, which works with business leaders to invest in new public schools.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for executive recruiter Charles Tribbett III, Lockett had the clincher: She was an African-American woman. Lockett knew that's why Tribbett, a respected civic leader and executive at search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, was vetting her to join the board of one of the city's largest cultural institutions, and she had no qualms about it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I thought it was wonderful, because when you look at the composition of board membership across our most treasured institutions, the diversity is abysmal,\" Lockett said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Chicago's nonprofits it's been an issue for a long time: How to recruit more (and different) minority representatives to boards when the pool of candidates who have the big job titles and wealth is still too small.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So for the last three years, about $400,000 has been spent placing nine highly qualified minorities, including Lockett, on the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits. Funded by the Joyce Foundation, Chicago-based Boeing Co. and The Chicago Community Trust, the program, called IMPACT, ended in December after 13 of the city's 25 largest institutions agreed to consider nominees from outside \"the usual suspects\" -- not from their immediate social network, said Peter Kuntz, the executive director of the Arts & Business Council.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many of the city's civic boards relied on a very small number of minority leaders who were well known by the establishment -- Valerie Jarrett, Desiree Rogers, Tina Tchen,\" said Adele Simmons, the former president of the MacArthur Foundation. \"When they went to Washington (to serve in the Obama administration), they left a lot of vacancies.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz said that these large institutions frequently reported, \"We just don't know how to find these people.\" Searching for \"a whole new group hiding in plain sight,\" Kuntz says, takes time. Furthermore, white men dominate corporate board rooms, which are the most fruitful recruiting ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A dream board is to have the CEO of every large corporation in Chicago,\" said Maureen Smith, one of the city's most active philanthropists. \"Because what we want are people with such seniority in their company that they can make a giving decision on their own, and don't have to ask someone up the ladder.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the IMPACT candidates were required to meet annual giving requirements, which ranged from $3,000 to $25,000. But it is never that simple, insiders say. Is there an unspoken, higher standard? Some minorities have departed boards, bitterly, after organizations abruptly enforced what previously were flexible standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid such conflicts, Ellen Alberding, the CEO of the Joyce Foundation, turned to Tribbett. Tribbett, who is black, says that \"seasoned\" minorities like himself -- he serves on at least four civic boards -- \"are all almost tapped out. There is a need for a new generation.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tribbett agreed to take on the project pro bono and assigned one of his employees, Lyndon Taylor, to help oversee the process. Taylor ultimately became a participant in the program, joining the board of Hubbard Street Dance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Everyone we placed was a peer,\" Taylor said. \"There was no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz justifies spending a large amount of money to find nine people by saying that he expects a snowball effect. These nine will be able to recruit more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the search began, the Arts & Business Council spent a year trying to persuade the institutions to join the program. More than half declined. Some said they were doing fine on their own; others didn't have any board openings. The recession forced a handful of recruits to withdraw, but of those who remained, all were voted onto six boards. The group includes seven blacks, one Hispanic and one Native American.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I kind of worked under the operating sense that Russell Reynolds and others wouldn't go to all this effort if we just looked at it as sort of a shopping list and said, 'Eh, I don't think so,' \" said Charles Katzenmeyer, vice president for external affairs at the Adler Planetarium, which added Kathy Hannan, a national managing partner at KPMG, and Lockett to its board through the program. \"As for fundraising, it can't be ignored because that person turns into a token.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melissa Harris, who wishes diversity didn't need a special program, can be reached at mmharris@tribune.com or 312-222-4582.

They didn't have the fire in the belly to compete. And that caused a lot of bellyaching within the political establishment--mostly among Democrats--about being stuck with the reserves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We deserve better. What a choice!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, time out. Quit the moaning. Like it or not, one of these four people will be California's next governor: Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, 51; or a Democrat--Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, 55; zillionaire airline exec Al Checchi, 49; or Rep. Jane Harman, 52, of Torrance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They've all got the fire--the energy and the courage--to fight for the most important elective office to be filled in America this year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as Checchi campaign manager Darry Sragow points out: \"The absolute truth is the republic will survive with any of these four at the helm.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's play could've-should've for a moment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 64, could have been a great governor. But she's very comfortable in her current job and dreaded getting roughed up in a gubernatorial race. She was flinching. So Feinstein is better off staying in the Senate, where she excels, and the state probably is better off too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leon Panetta, 59--former Monterey congressman and White House chief of staff--had promise. He could have been an excellent governor. But he wasted all last year deferring to fellow Democrat Feinstein. She didn't bow out until Jan. 20, too late for him to get organized. If Panetta actually had the fire, however, he would have spent last year traveling the state, showing concern for its problems, raising money and positioning himself to run.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, 67, teased the news media and basked in the begging before concluding that he was just too comfortable--to run or to serve. \"Be careful, you might get what you're going after,\" Riordan said he told himself. \"I love California, but Los Angeles is still my No. 1 love.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fine. Then he made the right decision to stay there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But please spare us the spin about how the mayor was a virtual cinch winner. First, he had to beat Lungren for the GOP nomination. Lungren is a good Republican; Riordan is a good Republican mostly in the eyes of Democrats. He endorsed Feinstein in 1994 and didn't support either the anti-illegal immigration or anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> initiatives. He was a fat target for Lungren. Plus, he's not very good on the stump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new open primary certainly would have helped. But we'll never know whether enough Democrats would have crossed over to nominate Riordan for the Republicans. That's awfully iffy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we're left with is a wide-open race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls show Davis leading in the Democratic contest. But Checchi--having already spent more than $4 million of his fortune on TV ads--is moving up fast. In mock general elections, both Davis and Checchi run about even with Lungren.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harman is the only woman in the race and that's presumed to be a plus. But she's a late entry and unknown outside L.A. She urgently needs to develop a compelling message and to spend millions of her own dollars getting it out on TV.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a myth that Harman also is the only moderate running. Davis still gets tagged as a liberal because two decades ago he was Gov. Jerry Brown's top aide, but basically he's a moderate. And Checchi? He wants to execute serial rapists. That's hardly liberal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've got a race between three experienced pols and an outsider--Checchi--who frequently hasn't even voted. However, he did spend all last year stumping the state boning up on issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe these aren't the best governors conceivable. But they're the most eager. They've got the fire and really want the job. The others refused to run. It's time to stop grousing and start choosing</p>\n"}

When I first came to Sacramento, there were only two women and six Hispanic members among the 120 legislators; now 26 women and 20 Hispanic members serve in the Capitol, and the numbers are growing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One area that has not changed for the better is the personal relationships among legislators. This decline makes the job less enjoyable and makes it more difficult to agree on public policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I first came to Sacramento, legislators worked together by day and socialized by night. Sometimes we argued, but it was always done respectfully. I was friends with rural, conservative Republicans and they were friends with me, a liberal Democrat from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I would umpire softball games between the Senate and Assembly (I admit I threw a few calls to the more \"mature\" and \"deliberative\" Senate players.) Legislators would get together at the Derby Club, a lunch organization established in 1953. The club has a strict rule prohibiting discussion of legislative business so people can to know each other as human beings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Frank Fat's, a 60-year-old Chinese restaurant three blocks from the Capitol building, often was filled with legislators sharing a meal or drink.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the atmosphere has changed. Years go by without a softball game. The Derby Club is ebbing because younger legislators have shown little interest in attending a weekly lunch. I see fewer legislators hanging out at Fat's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasingly, members of the Legislature do not take the time to get to know one another on a personal level. Socializing with a member of the opposite party is almost considered an act of treason among some newer, more partisan members.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The respectful courtesy that opponents once extended during floor debates has given way to petty bickering, personal insults and simplistic bombast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several factors have contributed to the change. Public discourse generally has become more crass, corroded by television sound bites, shrill talk-radio hosts and candidates promising easy fixes to complex problems.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Term limits have short-circuited the ability of legislators to develop relationships that will last beyond the next election. An increased number of competitive legislative districts has raised the political stakes as each party vies for control of the two houses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever the reasons, the erosion of personal relationships hurts the Legislature's ability to deal with the difficult issues ahead.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my view, the deterioration of relationships in the Legislature contributed to the disturbing racial undertones of recent ballot measures concerning <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, bilingual education and illegal immigration. It was heartbreaking to see legislators from differing cultural or racial backgrounds debate these issues with an utter lack of sensitivity or understanding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politics has never been an avocation for the meek. It attracts people with healthy egos and strong opinions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under these conditions, it is essential for legislators to get to know one another personally, off hours, to discuss nonlegislative matters. Learn about families, hobbies and upbringing. Discover hopes and motivations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the most diverse society in human history and the most complicated state in the nation, California needs legislators who will work hard at developing harmony.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good place to start is at lunch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: Herschel Rosenthal</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Herschel Rosenthal is a Democrat who has represented portions of the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles</p>\n"}
{"id": "421525331.xml", "text": "<h2>Commentary; COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES W. ROBINSON; Eight-Hour Bill Shows Davis' True Colors; Forget what he says about charting a centrist course. Look at the actions he's taken since he was elected last fall.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sooner or later it had to happen. After carefully cultivating the image that he is making good on his campaign pledge to lead California from the center, Gov. Gray Davis has taken a sharp turn leftward by signing legislation making California the only state except Alaska to require overtime pay after an eight-hour day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision unmasks a reality that state Republicans--still shell-shocked after last November's drubbing at the polls--have yet to effectively challenge Davis on, which is that the new governor's course is not nearly as centrist as he would like us to believe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flanked on the left by an unarguably liberal California Legislature and the labor, environmental and trial lawyer interest groups that backed his candidacy, Davis barely needs to break a sweat to look moderate by comparison. But he can't leave those constituencies completely empty-handed--and he certainly hasn't.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State labor laws across the nation generally require overtime pay after a 40-hour week. Employers are comfortable with that rule and report that most employees governed by it seem to enjoy the flexibility of working fewer hours some days and making up the time on other days. The bill that Davis signed on Tuesday was one of organized labor's top legislative priorities for the year. It reverses a decision by the Industrial Welfare Commission two years ago to scrap overtime pay after an eight-hour day in favor of the 40-hour rule.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Jan. 1, 2000, California will thus become one of two states to require overtime pay after eight hours, which in this state affects some 8 million employees and tens of thousands of businesses. California workers and companies alike will lose flexibility. Employees now working more than eight hours a day but less than 40 hours a week will likely lose pay. And California's business climate can now be justifiably indicted by other states competing for investment and jobs as having the country's singularly most rigid regulatory regime governing workplaces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While unions celebrated, Davis and his aides struggled to claim that, at the governor's insistence, employers' concerns were accommodated in the legislation with provisions allowing various exemptions. But those provisions offer nothing more than a fig leaf of flexibility, and neither Republican legislators nor the state's major business organizations bought it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom among Capitol-watchers has held that Davis alternates between tacking a little bit to the left, then a little bit to the right, keeping allies generally mollified, critics off-balance and his centrist image intact. Exhibiting the same message discipline they demonstrated throughout the campaign, Davis and his spinmeisters chant the \"I am governing from the center\" mantra virtually every day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But does the message match the record? Forcing state businesses to don a new regulatory straitjacket prescribed in the eight-hour legislation is not the first time in his young administration that Davis has veered off center. Union, environmental and trial lawyer activists have been rewarded with top appointments drawn from their ranks. Davis has orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> at the University of California. Despite promising a new relationship with Mexico, he is still on record opposing NAFTA and shows no sign of challenging his union supporters by backing other free-trade measures that can help California.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tougher challenges to Davis' moderate image lie ahead. Will he approve legislation piling new mandates on health care plans and allowing patients to sue HMOs? How far will he go on gun control, labor and the environment? As reported by The Times' George Skelton, the governor and his aides are alarmed that an avalanche of bills landing on his desk on these subjects could, with increasing frequency, force Davis to choose between his natural political allies and his pledge to govern from the middle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis is no flaming liberal. He seems to genuinely understand the limits of government power and especially the limits to the voters' patience for a return to the halcyon days of big government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sacramento is made up of more than just a governor, and a vast state administration is made up of more than one man. Union leaders, trial lawyers, environmentalists and activists who believe in regulatory expansion are in charge again. Every so often Davis tells them to slow down. But he doesn't tell them to stop.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James W.

It's probably the person the President accused of creating the impression of heartless foolishness by defining ketchup as a school-lunch vegetable. Instead of firing the culprit, they must have transferred him/her to Personnel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How else explain the move to select Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation? That is the already battered Federal program of aid for people who need lawyers but can't afford them. And how else explain the nomination of William Bell, a Detroit pol with no accomplishments in management or civil rights, to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission? This not the first time this Administration has looked to foxes to guard chickens, but the effort is becoming suspiciously obvious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Reagan team, to be sure, tried at first to kill the legal services program directly. But Congress, which is still supposed to write the laws, refused. The level of funding and terms of operation were then compromised, but the White House will not quit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although there is an ample supply of candidates with legal aid experience, Mr. Zumbrun has never been near that bar. He has denounced the law that he would now administer. He has vigorously opposed the program both as a California official and as president of the Pacific Legal Foundation. His preference in legal aid is helping those needy corporations that oppose Government regulation, clean water standards and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Zumbrun would devour his agency, Mr. Bell would probably just strangle his. He is black and has no known hostility to the idea of promoting equal employment. But the minority recruiting firm he leads hasn't placed a single employee this year. The Detroit company, Bold Concepts, Inc., has no phone listing. Its leader is little known in his own city and unknown to the civil rights community. His only recognized asset is political labor for Mr. Reagan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nomination of Mr. Zumbrun would insult the poor and the legal profession. The nomination of Mr. Bell is an insult to workers of any race or sex and also to managements that find themselves in job bias disputes. Instead of pressing these appointments, the White House headhunters had better find the saboteur in their own cave.</p>\n"}

''Should I get tougher on Clinton?'' he asked the crowd. ''You won't get mad at me if I get a little tougher?''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By yesterday, after 24 hours of further vacillation, Mr. Dole had firmly decided that he would take off the gloves in tonight's debate (though the word ''firmly'' must always be used with caution in proximity to either Presidential candidate). Now he must confront Bill Clinton in the most inhospitable debate forum for fisticuffs -- a town-hall meeting where he'll be surrounded by 120 ''real people.'' And he must do so on a night less than three weeks before Election Day in a year when the debates thus far have failed to draw audiences anywhere near as large as those of '92.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did Mr. Dole paint himself into this corner? Conventional wisdom blames the press for intimidating him into silence until now by threatening to shout ''Hatchet man!'' the moment he ''goes negative.'' But raising serious questions about Clinton Administration ethics, phrased precisely and respectfully, is not the same as railing about ''Democrat wars'' or crying ''Liberal!'' or invoking Paula Jones. The obvious questions Mr. Dole might ask tonight -- whether about the rifling of F.B.I. files, potential pardons for the McDougals or an influence-seeking Indonesian campaign contributor -- have been aired daily by the press itself. If Mr. Dole had articulately raised some of them weeks ago, he wouldn't so easily fit the Clinton/Gore playbook's current description of him as ''desperate.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being so indecisive about how to act on the Clinton character issue, Mr. Dole has not only given the President a free pass, he has dramatized a big character issue of his own. Mr. Dole's habit of equivocating and reversing himself has been a damaging pattern of his candidacy from the start on a variety of fronts, not just on the matter of challenging White House ethics. He's visibly wavered so often that his leadership capabilities are as much in doubt as who hired Craig Livingstone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the primaries, Mr. Dole waffled about how to go after Pat Buchanan's extremist views much as he has waffled about challenging Mr. Clinton, refusing even to criticize Mr. Buchanan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric. When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his ''not negotiable'' call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform. Most self-destructively of all, Mr. Dole abruptly reversed his career-long stands in favor of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and against supply-side economics to prove himself, as he put it, ''another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This recent history helps explain why so many Americans don't regard Mr. Dole as a leader, but as a split-the-difference Beltway legislative mechanic. If he can't stand up to fellow Republicans, not to mention his Democratic opponent, how will he stand up to a Saddam Hussein? If he can't command his own campaign, how can he run the country? Even his own conservative allies now raise the Dole character issue -- as typified by last week's Charles Kraut hammer column faulting Mr. Dole for lacking the ''political courage'' to match his ''physical courage'' of 50 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Dole's character failings hardly cancel out his opponent's, but they are devastating to his hopes of presenting himself as a plausible Presidential alternative. His equivocations, reversals and avoidance of confrontations fuel the polls in which voters doubt he is tough enough to push through a 15 percent tax cut and balance the budget at the same time. Dole admirers, by contrast, point out how appealing it is to find a politician who honestly expresses his ambivalence in public rather than sticking to a phony, robotic script. That's true enough. But while Hamlets can be appealing, their chances of inheriting the White House are by definition no more likely than their ascent to the Danish throne.</p>\n"}
{"id": "430898745.xml", "text": "<h2>Talking About Race in Akron</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>\n"}

One year after California passed a referendum banning the use of race and ethnicity in public college admissions, the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians admitted to the University of California's two top campuses has dropped precipitously, leading to concern about the resegregation of higher education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while the news from California is dismaying, a different, more encouraging story is being written in Texas, a state with political leaders who see diversity as a rich resource that benefits everyone, not only people of color.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, a Federal court outlawed consideration of race in higher-education admissions in Texas. At the time, the state had been using high school grades and Scholastic Assessment Test scores along with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> criteria to decide admissions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the ruling, a panel of professors and community activists joined a group of Hispanic and black lawmakers to persuade the State Legislature to adopt what has come to be called the 10 percent plan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This eliminated the use of S.A.T. scores for Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school class and automatically admitted them to the two most selective public schools, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M University.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At first, some critics objected that S.A.T. scores were indispensable measures of future success. But, as the advisory group of professors and activists pointed out, the best way to predict how a student will do in college is by measuring classroom performance in high school. This was borne out when achievement tests administered to the thousands of minority students admitted through the program showed that only a handful needed remedial education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far the Texas plan has produced many winners. As of March of this year, 7 percent more black and 21 percent more Mexican-American applicants were eligible for enrollment under this system than under the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> guidelines. And access to public education has increased for white high school graduates in rural parts of Texas -- students who also tend not to do well on the S.A.T. and so had been refused admission to the most competitive public colleges under the old system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No wonder a number of moderate white legislators joined the coalition in supporting the plan. As State Representative Irma Rangel pointed out, the 10 percent plan treats all groups equally, giving them ''the respect they deserve.'' Similarly, when Gov. George Bush, a Republican, signed the bill, he declared, ''We want all our students in Texas to have a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and this legislation gives them that fair shot.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas officials recognize that there is more to be done beyond rethinking college admissions policy. They have also formulated new ideas for improving primary schools. Schools and districts are now required to report test scores, attendance and dropout rates by race, ethnicity and economic standing. Each school is then rated according to the performance of the various ethnic and economic groups. This means more attention is paid to every student, and the entire class benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students are closing the achievement gap. On a national math test given in 1996, Texas fourth graders in various categories -- white, black and poor students -- all ranked first in the country. By contrast, California, where politicians have demonized issues of race, education and immigration, saw its fourth graders, including white students, finish near the bottom, ahead of those in only two other states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas's innovative approaches, and its less polarized environment, are helping to shift an increasingly narrow debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> into a wider public discussion on education. This also sends the message that access and diversity are not the enemy of excellence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Michael Bartalos)</p>\n"}

The relation between freedom and literacy became the compelling theme of the slave narratives, the great body of printed books that ex-slaves generated to assert their common humanity with white Americans and to indict the system that had oppressed them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the years since the abolition of slavery, the possession of literacy has been a cardinal value of the African-American tradition. It is no accident that the first great victory in the legal battle over segregation was fought on the grounds of education -- of equal access to literacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, blacks are failing to gain access to the new tools of literacy: the digital ''knowledge economy.'' And while the dilemma that our ancestors confronted was imposed by others, this cybersegregation is, to a large degree, self-imposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Government's latest attempt to understand why low-income African-Americans and Hispanics are slower to embrace the Internet and the personal computer than whites -- the Commerce Department study ''Falling Through the Net'' -- suggests that income alone can't be blamed for the so-called digital divide. For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms. Net promoters are concerned that the digital divide threatens to become a 21st century poll tax that, in effect, disenfranchises a third of the nation. Our children, especially, need access not only to the vast resources that technology offers for education, but also to the rich cultural contexts that define their place in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today we stand at the brink of becoming two societies, one largely white and plugged in and the other black and unplugged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the most tragic aspects of slavery was the way it destroyed social connections. In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls ''social death,'' slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illustration (Stephen Doyle)</p>\n"}
{"id": "431493919.xml", "text": "<h2>A Lesson In Bigotry And Liberty</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But moving on is not a straight course.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p>\n"}
{"id": "432267882.xml", "text": "<h2>Bonfire Of the Vanities</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's only one thing left for Trent Lott to do now. He will have to become a Democrat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pinata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing</p>\n"}
{"id": "432374988.xml", "text": "<h2>Why Justice O'Connor Could Be Affirmative Action's Unlikely Savior</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kirk Kolbo was just about to tell the Supreme Court that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> violates the Constitution when Sandra Day O'Connor cut him off. Universities use many factors in admissions. How did he know his client was turned down for being white? When he replied that race simply could never be used, Justice O'Connor said tartly, ''You have some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with.'' Moments later, she added, ''You are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There could have been little doubt among the spectators packed into the Supreme Court last Tuesday that history was being made. Outside, thousands of protesters marched with signs proclaiming ''Equal Opportunity for All,'' and, in the case of one young marcher, a photo of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School. The conservative Center for Individual Rights, which is backing the plaintiffs, spoke of the day being ''<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Affirmative Action</span>'s Alamo.'' The two cases against the University of Michigan -- one against its undergraduate program, the other against its law school -- came to the Supreme Court with five years of momentum. But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>'s unlikely savior.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses. Justice O'Connor, who asked at argument what impact California's anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> referendum has had on law schools there, is likely to worry about this real-world impact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is Justice O'Connor's inclination to look for herself in the litigants who appear before her. On the surface, Justice O'Connor may seem like the white plaintiffs in these cases. But she owes her place on the court not only to her immense talent and drive, but also to a governmental act -- in her case, by President Reagan -- that can only be called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span>. In the end, Justice O'Connor may take a close look at the hard-working, bright University of Michigan applicants who get a few extra points on their applications because they are minorities -- and see herself.</p>\n"}

The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But now my right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for ''the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.'')</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then to the affirmative-action angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired? Oh, we know your editors insist that ''diversity'' had nothing to do with it. But remember what Senator Dale Bumpers said about our impeachment of Clinton: ''When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex' -- it's about sex.'' This is about diversity backfiring.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's my reply to their Kulturkampf: For exactly 30 years, I have been supported handsomely for disagreeing with The Times's editorial page, which is dovish on defense, leftist on economics and (with the exception of civil liberties) resolutely wrongheaded. Never have I been silenced, and conservative thinkers have an ever-fairer shake on the Op-Ed page.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for news coverage being influenced by editorial policy, I evoke the name of my predecessor: that's a Krock. On occasion, a leftist slant on a story slips through the backfield, but with conservatives boring from within and fulminating from without, the news side soon straightens itself out. What is ''fit to print'' is the truth as straight as we can tell it, which is why Times people are so furious at this galling breach.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now about the supposed cost of diversity: A newspaper is free to come down on the side of giving black journalists a break if its owners and editors so choose. What's more, this media world would also benefit from more Hispanics and Asians coming up faster.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the 375 Times reporters who make up the greatest assemblage of talent and enterprise in the field of gathering and writing the news, I submit this hard line:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Self-examination is healthy but self-absorption is not; self-correction is a winner but self-flagellation is a sure loser. Let us slap a metaphoric cold steak over our huge black eye and learn from this dismaying example -- so that other journalists in the nation and around the world can continue to learn from ours.</p>\n"}
{"id": "432763623.xml", "text": "<h2>Hernandez v. Brown</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''Racism on Trial: The Chicano Fight for Justice.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With commemorations from coast to coast to remind them, most Americans already know that this week was the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Unfortunately, what they don't realize is that the country missed an equally important anniversary two weeks ago, that of Hernandez v. Texas -- the perennially overshadowed antecedent to Brown that was decided on May 3, 1954.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That case merits commemoration not just because the Supreme Court used it to finally extend constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans, important though that is, especially now that Latinos are the largest minority group. It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p>\n"}
