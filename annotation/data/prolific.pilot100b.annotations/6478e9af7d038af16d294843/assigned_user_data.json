Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would \"dilute decades of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,\" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was \"racial balance,\" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. \"Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,\" explains the Economist magazine, but \"these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,\" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. \"Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,\" explains the Economist magazine, but \"these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,\" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,\" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family \"fragile, deprived and often psychopathic.\" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for \"educational parks,\" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be \"independent and assertive\" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for \"black dollar days\" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at \"saving\" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of \"second chance universities\" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it. And in an era when politicians and community leaders believe that grabbing a photo-op or popping a sound-bite is leadership, King's vision and program still looks and sounds better than anything they offer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of \"Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class in America.\" E-mail: ehutchi344@aol.com</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.; A Visionary With More Than a Dream; Today's fuzzy icon had many practical ideas for improving the lot of blacks, some now taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The four words, \"I have a dream,\" seared into the nation's consciousness by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. almost 34 years ago, have been both a blessing and a curse. To many, they are a beacon still calling to the country. To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,\" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family \"fragile, deprived and often psychopathic.\" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for \"educational parks,\" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be \"independent and assertive\" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King.

Sebelius does he use the word \"integrity.\" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the \"integrity\" or \"legitimacy\" or \"reputation\" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was \"trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington.\" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for \"a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.\" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts \"been just an associate justice, and not the chief\" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a \"strike\" was changed to a \"ball\" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: \"Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: \"By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning \"sufficient political capital\" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed.
