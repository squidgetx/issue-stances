When Mr. Dole's campaign officials made the embarrassing gaffe of returning a $1,000 contribution from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, the candidate dawdled for months before finally chastising his own errant staff. On abortion, he has quickly retreated under fire on nearly every stand he has taken this year, including his ''not negotiable'' call for a tolerance plank in the G.O.P. platform.

When Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Kerry about a report that Mr. Bush's I.Q. was higher than his, how did he respond?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) But he doesn't even speak French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I've never misunderestimated his intelligence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) That's great.

In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen. What was the most common response?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) It swayed me to vote for the celebrity's candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) It swayed me to vote for the other candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>9. In the same survey, respondents were asked to name the celebrity whose endorsement was least likely to make them vote for a presidential candidate. Here are the four names mentioned the most often.

When Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Kerry about a report that Mr. Bush's I.Q. was higher than his, how did he respond?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) But he doesn't even speak French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I've never misunderestimated his intelligence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) That's great.

It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?

Joseph Lieberman as running mate, and tapped Mrs. Townsend instead, it's quite possible she'd be vice president today, stumping for Democratic candidates along with President Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lieberman's peak as a candidate in 2000 occurred on the very day he was chosen by Mr. Gore, with the expected mainstream media exultation at the \"daring\" selection of a Jewish man given the nod. Not only was the Connecticut senator overmatched by Dick Cheney in their one debate, but his hollow threats of censoring the entertainment industry, while accepting massive donations from Hollywood moguls, exposed him as a hypocrite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend was excluded from Mr. Gore's \"short list\" because of her inexperience -- one-and-a-half terms as Maryland's lieutenant governor and a failed congressional race in 1986 -- and presumably because her state is one of the most reliably Democratic in the nation. However, there's little doubt that her candidacy would not have cost Mr. Gore a single state he eventually won against President Bush. In fact, given her pedigree as Robert F. Kennedy's eldest child, with an extended family campaigning for the ticket, it's likely the team would've won New Hampshire, West Virginia and Florida, and thus the election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Mrs. Townsend, never a nimble candidate on her own, is struggling to fend off Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich in this year's battle to succeed the unpopular Parris Glendening as Maryland's governor. The contest has been mired in a statistical dead heat since mid-summer -- a Mason-Dixon Maryland poll last weekend showed Mrs. Townsend leading Mr. Ehrlich by a 46% to 45% margin -- as Mrs. Townsend has failed to lock up the state's large black electorate, a base of voters that's typically a given for a Democratic candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Townsend's political pitch has been less than perfect. In June she angered Baltimore City's black leaders by choosing retired Navy Admiral Charles Larson, a white former Republican, as her running mate. Mr. Ehrlich, meanwhile, a four-term congressman from Baltimore County, chose a black man, Michael Steele.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fairness, the current political environment, influenced as it's been by corporate scandals and a backlash against wealthy businessmen, doesn't make the most hospitable turf for a candidate born to privilege. In contrast to Mrs. Townsend, Mr. Ehrlich was reared in the blue-collar Baltimore suburb of Arbutus, where he earned an academic/sports scholarship to Princeton. He then returned to Maryland, spending eight years in the state's House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 1994.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The juxtapositions of the two candidates have been occasionally startling, and more than occasionally provided good campaign rhetoric for Mr. Ehrlich. Last July, when Mrs. Townsend had a fund-raiser for glittering contributors at her family's mythic Hyannis Port compound, Mr. Ehrlich held a $20 per person crab-and-beer fest in Anne Arundel County. He remarked at the time, \"We're having fun, obviously. The lieutenant governor is home, and I am home.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the polls tightened during the summer, Mrs. Townsend shed her pledge to wage a \"positive\" campaign and hired longtime Kennedy confidante Robert Shrum, the populist millionaire known for slash-and-burn advertising and rhetoric. Four years ago, Mr. Shrum orchestrated an attack against Gov. Glendening's GOP opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, that called her a racist, a charge that even Democrat and then-Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke repudiated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Beinart, editor of the New Republic, wrote in the magazine's Oct. 21 issue that \"Election 2002 does have at least one ennobling characteristic: Race has never mattered less.\" But in Maryland that's not true. In a late-September debate held at the predominantly black Morgan State University and sponsored by the allegedly nonpartisan NAACP, Mrs. Townsend attacked her competitor's opposition to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Mr. Ehrlich \"opposes <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> based on race,\" she said, \"Well, let me tell you something, slavery was based on race. Lynching was based on race. Discrimination is based on race. Jim Crow was based on race. And <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be based on race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can question Mr. Ehrlich's consent to debate Mrs. Townsend in such a setting -- his family was booed upon entering the auditorium -- but it's not clear that such demagoguery will work. A Democratic consultant in Maryland told me that \"KKT won the debate in the hall, but Ehrlich won it on TV because the performance of the NAACP and the mob in the auditorium turned off many white voters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither is it clear that Mrs. Townsend's caricature of Mr. Ehrlich as a Gingrich-style extremist resonates with voters. While he has voted with the Republican majority in the House 90% of the time, his moderate views on social issues -- qualified support for abortion rights, legalization of marijuana for terminal patients and pro-stem cell research -- hardly squares with her charge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result of this race might be determined by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan region, including Maryland's Democratic Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mrs. Townsend has aired television advertisements in the past week slamming Mr. Ehrlich for his record on gun control, while on the stump emphasizing her own family's well-known tragedies at the hands of lunatic assassins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this politicization of a hot-button issue invigorates her base supporters or turns off independents who believe she's exploiting the killings could decide the election. Even Maureen Dowd, the liberal New York Times op-ed columnist criticized Mrs. Townsend, writing on Oct. 16: \"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An even bigger question is whether citizens in Maryland -- especially in areas where the sniper has killed -- will be motivated to vote on Election Day if the assailant isn't apprehended by then.

That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular \"grass- roots\" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the \"death tax\" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent).

Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as \"big government.\" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word \"nuclear\" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening. The common view is that elites run the show and sheep- like citizens allow them to. In fact, organized interests able to motivate blocs of voters really can make a difference, as long as they can stick around for a while.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, not every vital issue has a group or groups that are clever or rich enough to generate unrelenting support from back home. That leaves out of the mix too many people with worthy woes: the unemployed, the uninsured, the unaligned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's probably an opportunity there for yet another powerful interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kstreetconfidential@washpost.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Birnbaum is a Post reporter whose</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>K Street Confidential column on the intersection of business and politics appears on alternate Mondays in the Business section.

That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular \"grass- roots\" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the \"death tax\" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing.

Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/427163446.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/427163446.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>ESSAY; Sununu's 'Different Template'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LEAD: A joke is told in politico-economic circles, attributed to Robert Strauss, about the unhurried deliberation - or lack of necessary urgency - that characterizes the Bush Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A joke is told in politico-economic circles, attributed to Robert Strauss, about the unhurried deliberation - or lack of necessary urgency - that characterizes the Bush Administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President is awakened by the sound of puppies crying in the night and goes down to the White House kitchen for a snack of pork rinds and a glass of milk.
