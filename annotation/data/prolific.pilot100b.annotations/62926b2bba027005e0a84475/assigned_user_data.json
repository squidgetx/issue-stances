The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the \"systematic demonization\" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb \"to bork,\" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. \"If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,\" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, \"we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose.\" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as \"a right-wing loony,\" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing \"Robert Bork's America\" as a place \"in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,\" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give \"women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair.

The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here\u2019s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump\u2019s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator \u2014 yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don\u2019t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy\u2019s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement \u2014 creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can\u2019t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u201cConservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,\u201d Skocpol told me, \u201cso they built from the bottom up.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court\u2019s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies \u2014 like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering \u2014 that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections \u2014 as they\u2019ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans\u2019 voting rights \u2014 among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that\u2019s a fight for another day. Most experts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 scholars and people in politics \u2014 believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it\u2019s a hypothetical concern. \u201cThe potential center-left majority in this country \u2014 and it\u2019s very real \u2014 has to actually organize and elect people to office,\u201d Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration\u2019s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee\u2019s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That\u2019s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms.

But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it.

Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it. That's a good sign.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a very good sign.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1987023512.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1987023512.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>The Heartbeat of Racism Is Denial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When our reality is too ugly, we deny reality.

Many people I interact with outside my job don\u2019t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I\u2019m Carlotta Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I\u2019m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like \u201cBone Saw.\u201d But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don\u2019t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don\u2019t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many \u2014 though by no means all, or even most \u2014 there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it \u2014 anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it\u2019s just a sense, a feeling I get from people\u2019s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I\u2019m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they\u2019re often surprised. It\u2019s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students.

Many people I interact with outside my job don\u2019t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I\u2019m Carlotta Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I\u2019m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like \u201cBone Saw.\u201d But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don\u2019t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don\u2019t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many \u2014 though by no means all, or even most \u2014 there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it \u2014 anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it\u2019s just a sense, a feeling I get from people\u2019s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I\u2019m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they\u2019re often surprised. It\u2019s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn\u2019t just about me \u2014 it\u2019s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans.
