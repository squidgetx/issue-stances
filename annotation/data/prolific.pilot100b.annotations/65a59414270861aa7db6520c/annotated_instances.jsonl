{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2236765173.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>How to Save Affirmative Action</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton Administration's reversal of position on a case that could be one of the most important of the Supreme Court's coming term has disappointed supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But given the tenor of the Court's recent decisions on racial preferences, the Administration has made a smart strategic move to preserve what can and should be saved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case concerns the decision of the Piscataway, N.J., school board to promote racial diversity by laying off a white teacher so that it could preserve the job of an equally qualified black teacher. Though the Administration had previously supported the school board, the brief it filed with the Supreme Court on Aug. 23 concedes that the board violated the civil rights of the white teacher.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In previous rulings, the Court has maintained that government use of racial preferences is constitutional only when such action is necessary to remedy a history of overt discrimination, or when the public goal being pursued is ''compelling.'' Moreover, the Court has said, the use of racial preferences must be ''narrowly tailored'' to meet the particular goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appellate court that heard the Piscataway case declared, in effect, that racial diversity could never be a compelling state interest. Should the Supreme Court completely uphold the appellate court's ruling, the use of race in decisions about hiring and firing public employees could, for all practical purposes, be prohibited.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Piscataway case, the avowed goal -- racial diversity within a single, small department of an otherwise diverse faculty -- does not seem ''compelling.'' And the way the school board chose to pursue its goal of diversity -- dismissing a white teacher solely because of her race -- was not ''narrowly tailored.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By acknowledging this, yet at the same time making a broader argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the Administration hopes to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The approach it has suggested in its brief is essentially a compromise. Even if the Piscataway school board was wrong in this specific instance in its use of racial preference, the Administration argues, there is still a place for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and not only to remedy past discrimination. Indeed, as it points out in its brief, there are times when taking race into account is the only way to further compelling public goals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A police department, for example, may need to recruit a diverse officer corps to carry on effective undercover work or to retain public confidence in neighborhoods where there are racial tensions. At schools and colleges, a diverse faculty may, through the example of its own collegiality, teach students important lessons about working across racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the absolutist opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have the upper hand, in the courts as well as in the broader public debate. California now outlaws the use of race in public hiring, contracting and education. And in a case challenging <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> at the University of Texas Law School, a Federal appeals court ruled last year that racial diversity in a student body could never constitute a compelling state interest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court declined to review that decision, but in taking on the Piscataway case, the Court has the opportunity to clarify the question of when, if ever, it is legitimate to use <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to achieve racial diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a grave error for the Court to adopt an absolutist color-blind view on the question of whether race should ever be a factor in decisions about public employment. Moreover, it is impossible to maintain such absolutism and still uphold a commitment to prevent racial discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider efforts to recruit job applicants that are directed toward minority candidates -- as when companies send recruiters to heavily black schools when blacks are underrepresented in their work force. Such efforts would clearly violate the color-blind principle. Even when the final hiring decision is made solely on the basis of an applicant's qualifications, without regard to race, these recruitment programs involve discrimination because they bestow the benefits of better job information and a greater number of alternative job offers on some individuals solely because of their race. Yet these programs are widespread in both the public and the private sectors, and they are needed to prevent discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to public employment, the Administration makes a strong case for considering race. Indeed, its argument could also be applied to the lifetime appointments to the Federal courts that interpret the constitutionality of race-based state action. The legitimacy of court rulings in this area would surely be undermined by the absence from the bench of nonwhite members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean that racial quotas should be used for judicial appointments. But as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned, there is a compelling public interest in racial diversity for its own sake. Perhaps the Justices who decide the Piscataway case will have the wisdom to see this point.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 7s "}}

The great secret is out: Liberals dominate campuses. Coming soon: \"Moon Implicated in Tides, Studies Find.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study of 1,000 professors finds that Democrats outnumber Republicans at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences. That imbalance, more than double what it was three decades ago, is intensifying because younger professors are more uniformly liberal than the older cohort that is retiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another study, of voter registration records, including those of professors in engineering and the hard sciences, found nine Democrats for every Republican at Berkeley and Stanford. Among younger professors, there were 183 Democrats, six Republicans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we essentially knew this even before the American Enterprise magazine reported in 2002 on examinations of voting records in various college communities. Some findings about professors registered with the two major parties or with liberal or conservative minor parties:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell: 166 liberals, 6 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stanford: 151 liberals, 17 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Colorado: 116 liberals, 5 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCLA: 141 liberals, 9 conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics reports that in 2004, of the top five institutions in terms of employee per capita contributions to presidential candidates, the third, fourth and fifth were Time Warner, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. The top two were the University of California system and Harvard, both of which gave about 19 times more money to John Kerry than to George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at Berkeley, denies that academic institutions are biased against conservatives. The disparity in hiring, he explains, occurs because conservatives are not as interested as liberals in academic careers. Why does he think liberals are like that? \"Unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice.\" That clears that up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A filtering process, from graduate school admissions through tenure decisions, tends to exclude conservatives from what Mark Bauerlein calls academia's \"sheltered habitat.\" In a dazzling essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bauerlein, professor of English at Emory University and director of research and analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that the \"first protocol\" of academic society is the \"common assumption\" -- that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, \"relevant.\" Bauerlein says that various academic fields now have regnant premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women's studies.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This gives rise to what Bauerlein calls the \"false consensus effect,\" which occurs when, because of institutional provincialism, \"people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population.\" There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls \"the law of group polarization.\" Bauerlein explains: \"When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs.\" They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle of belief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When John Kennedy brought to Washington such academics as Arthur Schlesinger Jr., John Kenneth Galbraith, McGeorge and William Bundy and Walt Rostow, it was said that the Charles River was flowing into the Potomac. Actually, Richard Nixon's administration had an even more distinguished academic cast -- Henry Kissinger, Pat Moynihan, Arthur Burns, James Schlesinger and others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academics such as the next secretary of state still decorate Washington, but academia is less listened to than it was. It has marginalized itself, partly by political shrillness and silliness that have something to do with the parochialism produced by what George Orwell called \"smelly little orthodoxies.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations -- except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies. In contrast, American campuses have more insistently proclaimed their commitment to diversity as they have become more intellectually monochrome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They do indeed cultivate diversity -- in race, skin color, ethnicity, sexual preference.

And America's. But what might an Obama victory mean for African-Americans in particular? Should we expect his administration to play a major role in black group advancement?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a century, black civic leaders have tangled over whether to pursue economic independence or focus their energies on integrating political, corporate and educational institutions. W.E.B. Du Bois, author of the groundbreaking 1903 treatise, \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" argued for the latter, while his contemporary, Booker T. Washington, said \"political activity alone\" was not the answer. In addition, insisted Washington, \"you must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence and character.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1960s, the black civil-rights leadership has sided with Du Bois. Between 1970 and 2001, the number of black elected officials in the U.S. grew from fewer than 1,500 to more than 9,000. And while impressive socioeconomic progress has been made, wide black-white gaps remain in educational achievement, homeownership rates, labor-force participation, income levels and other measures.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor should we conclude that civil-rights laws are responsible for the black progress that has occurred. For example, up until the 1950s, and in an era of open and rampant racial discrimination, the jobless rate for blacks was much lower than today and similar to that of whites in the same age group. In fact, blacks had higher labor-force participation rates than whites in every Census taken between 1890 and 1950. And in the decades preceding the 1960s -- that is, prior to the passage of landmark civil-rights bills and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> legislation -- there were sharp rises in black educational achievement, both absolutely and relative to whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economist Thomas Sowell has spent decades researching racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. and abroad. And his findings -- in books like \"Race and Culture: A World View,\" \"Affirmative Action Around the World\" and \"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?\" -- show that political activity generally has not been a factor in the rise of groups from poverty to prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Germans came to the U.S. as indentured servants during colonial times. And while working to pay off the cost of the voyage they studiously avoided participation in politics. Only after they'd risen economically did Germans begin seeking public office, culminating with the election of presidents Hoover and Eisenhower.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern can be found among Chinese populations in southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the U.S. In Argentina, where English minorities have done well financially and played a major role in the development of the economy, they've played almost no role in Argentine politics. And so it goes with Italians in the the U.S. and Jews in Britain: In both places economic gains have generally preceded political gains. \"Empirically, political activity and political success have been neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"Nor has eager political participation or outstanding success in politics translated into faster group achievement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans might keep in mind that in those rare instances where the political success of a minority group has come first, it has often resulted in slower socioeconomic progress. The Irish immigrants who came to the U.S. in the mid-19th century hailed from a country where 80% of the population was rural. Yet they settled in industrial centers like New York, Philadelphia and Boston and took low-skill jobs. Their rise from poverty was especially slow -- as late as 1920, 80% of all Irish women working in America were domestic servants -- despite the fact that Irish-run political organizations dominated many big-city governments.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Irish were fiercely loyal to each other, electing, appointing and promoting their own kind,\" writes Mr. Sowell. \"This had little effect on the average Irish American, who began to reach economic prosperity in the 20th century at about the same time when the Irish political machines began to decline.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If elected, Mr. Obama may well turn out to be a competent president, even an admirable one. But history gives us no indication that his political success will translate into black upward mobility. And given Mr. Obama's liberal leanings, there's every reason to believe that current obstacles to black progress will remain in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidate favors minimum-wage laws, for example, on the assumption that they help lift people out of poverty. But most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage. And most people who earn the minimum wage aren't poor. Minimum-wage laws are more likely to price people out of the labor market, especially younger and less educated workers, a large number of whom happen to be black. Today's economy places a premium on skills. If young people can't get an entry-level job because an artificial federal wage floor has made them too expensive to hire, they can't gain the skills and experience to move up the economic ladder.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take another example: Mr. Obama opposes educational choice, which will also have a negative impact on poor blacks, who tend to be the ones stuck in America's worst public schools. Mr. Obama opposes school vouchers that would allow low-income black parents to send their children to the type of private school where he sends his own daughters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In both cases, the only \"change\" that Mr. Obama would be bringing the Oval Office is the color of the person perpetrating bad policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Riley is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 41s "}}

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities \u2014 the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC\u2019s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success \u2014 a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles \u2014 I\u2019m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don\u2019t enroll in and 85% don\u2019t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU \u2014 a historically Black college or university \u2014 in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We\u2019re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn\u2019t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn\u2019t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we\u2019ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of \u201ccollege access managers,\u201d who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they\u2019re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students\u2019 need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not how high a student\u2019s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It\u2019s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students\u2019 own determination \u2014 the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it\u2019s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 54s "}}

RIGHT AT THE POLLS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet has made it easier than ever to find information, buy books, communicate with people all over the world, and goof off at work. Now it promises to simplify a dreary task that looms before us this year: choosing a president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, it does not provide the sort of \"help\" offered by glad- handing office-seekers who are eager to enumerate their heroic virtues and inspiring achievements--and to mournfully recite the many ways in which every single one of their opponents falls short. Between now and November, we will have plenty of middle-age men in blue suits doing their utmost to talk us into making a decision congenial to their interests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you would prefer to make a decision congenial to your interests, you can consult a couple of Web sites that serve the function for politics that the personal ads serve for romance: matching compatible partners. They give you questionnaires asking your views on various national issues, tabulate your answers, and tell you with whom you are most likely to find long-term happiness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these is selectsmart.com, where the range of choices goes from Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader, though it also includes all the sane people in the race. Candidates you have probably never heard of before, such as David McReynolds and Howard Phillips, are there, and the site provides sufficient candidate information to explain why you have never heard of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The questionnaire asks about abortion, crime, defense, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, education, taxes, foreign policy, and the like. I filled it out and was presented with a list of how my views compared with those of the candidates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the top of my list was Harry Browne, a Libertarian Party candidate who scored 89 on a scale of 100. No argument there: I voted for Browne in 1996, and I may do so again, more to express my general outlook on policy than because I really want his finger on the nuclear button. Tied for second were Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch (61), followed by George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, both at 53.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally interesting was finding out who would be most likely to cause me to emigrate to Canada should he ever get to the Oval Office. Moving down the list, I learned that I should vote for Donald Trump over Bill Bradley, and that my views would be better represented in the White House by David McReynolds, a Socialist, than by Al Gore. Only Warren Beatty, it seems, is further from my thinking than the vice president. Somehow, this last revelation did not come as a surprise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over at presidentmatch.com, the options are limited to candidates of the two major parties, and after I answered the quiz, I was informed that Alan Keyes and I were made for each other. Next was Steve Forbes, followed by George Bush. Coming in last, the blind date from hell, was none other than Al Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The main disagreement between the two sites was over the other candidates: selectsmart ranked John McCain better for me than Bill Bradley, while presidentmatch said I should run screaming from McCain, unless the only other option is the guy who invented the Internet. So if the contest comes down to Bradley and McCain, I'll have to flip a coin. Or shoot myself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all useful information, but it falls short of making the choice as easy as filling out the options you want on a new car, and it could be misleading for anyone who takes it too seriously. The matchmakers pay little attention to some important issues, like the federal budget, missile defense, letting China into the World Trade Organization, and the use of metal bats in baseball (Bush, bless him, would allow wood only).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Matters like experience in office get little weight, which makes Forbes and Browne look better than they really are. Temperament and political skills, in which Bush and Bradley might contrast favorably with Gary Bauer or Orrin Hatch, are not considered.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason Alan Keyes and I are classified as compatible is that neither President Match nor Select Smart gave me the chance to express my reluctance to vote for someone who appears to be out of his mind. Select Smart put Pat Buchanan in the middle of the pack for me, even though I would sooner pinch Mike Tyson on the bottom than vote for a raving anti-Semite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's something to be said for forcing yourself to contemplate which policies you favor--and for finding out whether the candidate you are drawn to for one reason or another is actually one who would head in the direction you want to go. By focusing on issues of substance, the quizzes are a good antidote to McCain's biography, Bradley's NBA career, Bush's rakish grin, and Gore's . . . well, Gore is probably his own antidote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if you want to make an intelligent choice in this election, you could do worse than to answer one of these questionnaires. And if you end up voting for Harry Browne, don't blame me.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 25s "}}

To others, they have indelibly tagged King as a hopeless utopian with lofty visions of ending war, racism and poverty, but with no concrete program to achieve these aims. No wonder the man we celebrate today has practically been turned into a harmless, badly outdated icon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he isn't. In a work largely ignored when it was published 30 years ago and all but unknown today, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,\" King turned from dreamer to problem solver. But before we look at those ideas, there are two huge caveats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, recasting the words of a historic figure to fit present situations must be avoided. This type of dangerous ideological revisionism was shamefully evident in the contentious debate over Proposition 209 in California. Both sides exploited and deliberately distorted the few stray remarks that King uttered on what is known today as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, a concept just beginning to take shape in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second caveat is that King can't be fitted into a neat ideological box. There is enough paradox and ambivalence in King's positions for liberals and conservatives to praise and damn. At various times, he railed against and embraced black militants. He applauded violent anti-colonial and national liberation movements and championed nonviolent change. Paradox and ambivalence also marked his private life. As a man of God, his moral lashing of America was wildly at odds with his questionable sexual conduct. Not surprisingly, King's solutions to many of the big-ticket racial and class problems that plagued America were a mix of idealism and pragmatism, which people faulted for lacking a clear direction. King can't be blamed for that. Three decades after his death, America is still no closer to solving these problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* The black family crisis. King branded the black family \"fragile, deprived and often psychopathic.\" While he could have been criticized for giving weight to negative myths and stereotypes about black families, King was correct in targeting father absenteeism in the black home as a major ill. He made the standard liberal call for more government-funded job, education and skills training programs. But he also recognized the importance of values like training, discipline, hard work and the reduction of family violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Educational neglect. King did not believe that more funds, smaller classrooms and better textbooks alone would solve the crisis of the classroom. He called on teachers and administrators to rededicate themselves to the ideal of quality education, and for parents to get more involved in their children's education. King's proposal for \"educational parks,\" a kind of multifaceted complex for teaching basic skills as well as advanced studies, anticipated the idea of magnet schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Political apathy. Exercising the right to vote and electing blacks were not enough for King. He challenged black officeholders to be \"independent and assertive\" in fighting for legislation to improve the plight of the black poor and for black organizations to build political alliances with labor and other ethnic groups based on the needs and interests they have in common.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Corporate racism. The campaign against discrimination in hiring and promotions that followed the Texaco scandal closely followed a four-step plan outlined by King. It included more jobs and promotions, selected buying campaigns, boycotts and organized protests, negotiations and the monitoring of any agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Economic empowerment. King often quipped that it was futile to integrate a lunch counter if blacks couldn't afford to buy a meal. He demanded huge increases in federal funding for job and skills training programs. But he also recognized that government couldn't or shouldn't be expected to do it all. He called for \"black dollar days\" in which blacks purchased goods and services from black businesses and deposited their savings in black-owned banks. In turn, King expected black entrepreneurs to recycle those dollars into education, recreation and social programs for the black poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Crime and violence. King understood that the destructive cycle of drugs, crime and violence destabilized black communities. While his first priority was, as always, more government-funded job and education programs, he also stressed family values, personal responsibility and discipline. He urged black professionals to give more of their time and money to employment, educational and recreational programs aimed at \"saving\" at-risk black youth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Welfare. King agreed that reliance on welfare could breed dependency and discourage personal initiative. He proposed that the government provide direct tax subsidies and tax incentives to corporations to hire and train unskilled workers. This idea was a forerunner of today's federally backed enterprise and empowerment zones. He also called for the creation of \"second chance universities\" to train welfare recipients and the unemployed to compete in the technological job market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By today's standards, King's agenda may seem piecemeal and patchwork. Almost all of his ideas have been either implemented, tried and discarded or discredited. But so what? King didn't just dream of a new world, he died fighting for it. And in an era when politicians and community leaders believe that grabbing a photo-op or popping a sound-bite is leadership, King's vision and program still looks and sounds better than anything they offer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of \"Beyond O.J.: Race, Sex and Class in America.\" E-mail: ehutchi344@aol.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 25s "}}

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 6s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word \"integrity.\" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the \"integrity\" or \"legitimacy\" or \"reputation\" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was \"trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington.\" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for \"a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.\" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts \"been just an associate justice, and not the chief\" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a \"strike\" was changed to a \"ball\" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: \"Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: \"By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning \"sufficient political capital\" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 10s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1878508466.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>What to ask Judge Gorsuch; Look beyond politics and his resume. Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to \"the little guy,\" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an \"originalist,\" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to \"apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, \"text\" and \"history\" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the \"equal protection of the laws\" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of the laws.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an \"originalist\" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated \"well qualified\" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 46s "}}

And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to \"brush him back.\" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. \"I guess I beaned him instead,\" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter.
