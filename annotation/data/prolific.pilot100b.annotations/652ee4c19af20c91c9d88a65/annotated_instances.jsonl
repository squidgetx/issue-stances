Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 40s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408366163.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Foreign Affairs in Annapolis</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was \"a little taken aback\" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. \"You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,\" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, \"MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,\" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as \"enormously secretive and powerful\" and \"a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the \"tantamount\" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard. The original plan was to wrap up talks by May; now U.S. officials say they need at least another year, and they'll oppose any firm deadline.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More to the point, they have learned from fast-track that they have to consult, while treaties are still being shaped, more than ever before -- with unions, local officials, environmentalists and others. The more the scope of trade talks goes beyond tariffs, the less they can be left exclusively to trade officials.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, as State Department officials know from their work in foreign capitals, consultation doesn't guarantee agreement. \"The State Department testimony only helped me more,\" says Baker. \"They admitted that what's going on in Nigeria is terrible -- and they couldn't point to much that they are doing about it.\" Before it's over for U.S. diplomats, Annapolis may make Pyongyang look easy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 3s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1919844871.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Is there bias on our ballots? To avoid charges of partisanship, let an independent third party put titles and summaries on initiatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Words matter. And when those words appear on the ballot, where space is limited and the competition for voter attention is high, they matter a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has become an issue for a group of Republicans who have proposed a ballot initiative to repeal a recently passed package of gas taxes and vehicle fees. On Friday, they sued California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claiming his office put a partisan spin on the title it gave their initiative. Instead of describing the initiative in a straightforward way, saying something like \"Repeals the gas tax,\" the title says instead: \"Eliminates recently enacted road repair and transportation funding by repealing revenues dedicated for those purposes. \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The description is accurate, as far as it goes. And even though the words \"taxes\" and \"fees\" don't appear in the title, they do appear in the summary that goes directly after the title on the signature petitions and on the ballot, if it qualifies. Anyone taking the time to read through the petition before signing it would figure out what the measure was all about.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the title is clunky and manages to avoid the simple and direct words that would clarify what the initiative actually does. Worse yet, the initiative's proponents believe that the language was made intentionally opaque to weaken the measure's support.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ballot proponents do not get to dictate the titles that go with their proposals, but there was no reason this title had to be so tortured. Does that mean the word choice was politically motivated? Not necessarily. It could merely be the result of having been written by lawyers. Ultimately, it will be up to a judge to decide whether Becerra should rewrite the title and summary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such complaints are unnecessarily common in situations where an attorney general from one party prepares the language for a ballot initiative pushed by people in the other party. State law gives the attorney general the responsibility of writing \"true and impartial\" titles and summaries without creating \"prejudice, for or against the proposed measure.\" Nevertheless, more than a couple of attorneys general have been accused of choosing -- or omitting -- words for the ballot title or summary to make a political point or to sway voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for his decision not to include the hot button words \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>\" in the summary of Proposition 209, the controversial 1996 ballot measure that ended state <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs. Former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, was accused of bias when she wrote the summary for a pension reform proposal. Jerry Brown, when he served as attorney general, was criticized for the language he used to describe Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a pretty simple solution: Give the duty to a nonpartisan third party. This idea has cropped up periodically in recent years, but hasn't gone anywhere. The most recent proposal, by Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Roseville), would reassign the writing of ballot titles and summaries to the Legislative Analyst's Office. The proposal (which would itself be in the form of a ballot initiative) was supported by California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California. But it was opposed by Becerra and died in its first committee hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kiley's bill may be dead, but this is an idea that ought to be given serious consideration by both parties. The LAO has done an admirable job of writing clear, concise and apolitical analyses of proposed legislation. It stands to reason the LAO would produce ballot titles and summaries with the same non-partisan balance and clarity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's bad enough that the titles of ballot measures are often vague and unhelpful. (Just consider two competing measures on the November statewide ballot: Proposition 62, titled simply \"Death Penalty,\" and Proposition 66, with the title \"Death Penalty. Procedures.\" Only when voters read the summary did it become clear that one measure proposed ending the death penalty in California and the other proposed speeding it up.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters shouldn't have to wonder also if those titles are a product of political spin.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}

Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W. Bush, signed the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If judicial restraint means anything, surely it counsels Supreme Court affirmation of the VRA -- against the pending challenge by Shelby County, Ala., which says it has basically ended voter discrimination so Congress has no right to subject it, or other mostly Southern jurisdictions, to Justice Department \"pre-clearance\" of its election rules, as prescribed in Section 5 of the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit wrote for the majority of a three-judge panel last year,\"in this context, we owe much deference to the considered judgment of the People's elected representatives.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem: Although hugely successful at securing the franchise for individual black voters, the Voting Rights Act has had corrosive unintended consequences, including, ironically, greater political polarization along racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As construed by courts, modified by Congress and enforced by the Justice Department, the act all but requires covered jurisdictions to maximize the concentration of African American and other minority voters in legislative districts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, this enables minorities to elect candidates \"of their choice.\" In practice, it divides many states into a small number of majority-black districts, which usually pick liberal African American Democrats, and a larger number of overwhelmingly white districts, which choose conservative white Republicans. Moderates get squeezed out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, \"opportunity districts\" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be \"congruent and proportional\" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be a pretty activist ruling. But it might just start a healthy debate about how we can protect voting rights while restoring the nation's political center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 49s "}}

Not long after stealing one Supreme Court seat, Republicans will have a chance to fill a second and move the court further to the right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the confirmation process could still turn out to be productive for Democrats \u2014 or it could become the worst of all worlds, both frustrating and damaging. The key now for the party and its voters is to understand the difference between those outcomes. Here\u2019s a three-step guide to doing so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step one: Be realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump\u2019s nominee is overwhelmingly likely to be confirmed regardless of what actions Democrats take. Republicans hold the Senate majority, and every Republican senator \u2014 yes, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2014 has a history of voting for judges like those Trump is considering. Collins and Murkowski have a script: They make centrist-sounding statements, to shore up their images, and then vote aye.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Democrats should go into the confirmation debate recognizing that it is almost certainly unwinnable. It will not depend on how hard Democratic leaders fight or which tactics they choose, alluring as that fantasy may be. In these polarized times, court nominations unite political parties, even more than individual issues, like, say, health care.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the coming nomination \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d It is not. The great political fights are still ahead. When a new justice is sworn in this fall, Democrats should not declare generational defeat or turn on each other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step two: Don\u2019t lose hope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has spent decades studying political power and change, from the Civil War to the Tea Party and anti-Trump resistance. She believes that Kennedy\u2019s retirement can be a clarifying moment for American liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the last half-century, conservatives have put more energy into building a movement \u2014 creating ideological institutions, grooming judges and, perhaps above all, winning local, state and congressional elections. Democrats have emphasized higher-profile politics, like the presidency and landmark court cases. Democrats can\u2019t afford to do so anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years to come, the Supreme Court is likely to have a very conservative majority. But remember that the modern conservative movement began when the court seemed implacably liberal, under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u201cConservatives were facing a Washington complex that horrified them,\u201d Skocpol told me, \u201cso they built from the bottom up.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember, too, the limits of the court\u2019s power. On some big issues, the court is not imposing right-wing policies on the entire country. It is instead refusing to ban state-based right-wing policies \u2014 like abortion restrictions and partisan gerrymandering \u2014 that progressives consider unconstitutional. (And, by the way, the court was already doing so with Kennedy .)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Progressives can still win many of these issues. They simply will have to do so in a small-d democratic way, by winning elections \u2014 as they\u2019ve begun to do lately . If Democrats win more governorships and state legislatures, they can keep Republicans from drawing ridiculous congressional maps and infringing on African-Americans\u2019 voting rights \u2014 among many other things. If Democrats retake Congress this fall, they can halt the Republican legislative agenda and gain subpoena power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I realize that a post-Kennedy Supreme Court may one day start throwing out progressive legislation, as happened in the early 20th century. But that\u2019s a fight for another day. Most experts I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 scholars and people in politics \u2014 believe that elected politicians can prevail in a long-term struggle with unelected judges. Regardless, until Democrats win more elections, it\u2019s a hypothetical concern. \u201cThe potential center-left majority in this country \u2014 and it\u2019s very real \u2014 has to actually organize and elect people to office,\u201d Skocpol says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Step three: Know your strengths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats will be tempted to turn the next two months into a national conversation about abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other social issues that inspire liberal passion. That would be a mistake. Those are not the best issues for Democrats during a midterm campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best issues are those on which Democrats hold a decisive advantage in public opinion . Health insurance is a good example. So are taxation, corporate power and the Trump administration\u2019s corruption. All of these issues can be grist for a nominee\u2019s Senate hearing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m not suggesting that Democratic senators ignore social issues. They just shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into thinking that the country is further to the left than it is . For instance, about two-thirds of Americans believe abortion should be illegal at least sometimes, according to Gallup , and many of the strongest opponents base their votes on the issue. That\u2019s why Republicans are happy to have these arguments .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nothing in American politics matters more right now than the outcome of the midterms. It is the difference between emboldening Trump and starting to hold him accountable. It really may be \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d And unlike the confirmation battle, the midterms remain up for grabs. In the coming weeks, Democrats will be talking about the Supreme Court, but they should be thinking about the midterms.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 48s "}}

While the Coalition for an Anti-Sexist Harvard rallied outside the science center, a hastily formed group with the laid-back name Students for Larry was milling about Lowell Lecture Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the crisis wasn't just about Larry Summers. Gendergate -- to give the scandal its obligatory suffix -- was more than a matter of an impolitic president. At stake is the university's very identity: Is Harvard liberal or conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one associated with the university, of course, would ever admit to thinking about it that way. How could such basic terms fit, given Harvard's image of itself as an institution that celebrates independence of beliefs and political affiliations as the essence of its charter? And not without justification: It can tenure Harvey Mansfield, the professor of government famous for his politically incorrect pronouncements, and Hilary Putnam, the philosophy professor who was handing out Progressive Labor pamphlets 35 years ago and seems not to have changed his mind on any issue since?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet why should we expect Harvard, and Harvard alone, to rise above the fray? Every issue on campus, just like every issue on every other campus, is refracted through the lens of left-right politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The number of tenured women professors there? Shockingly low, and it must be fixed by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, liberals insist. The result of fewer women getting on tenure track early in their careers, conservatives retort.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expansion of the campus to Allston? An imperial land grab, the liberals say, that ignores the needs of the surrounding community. A way to create a vibrant Silicon Valley on the Charles, conservatives argue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this way, the conflagration at Harvard simply mirrors the other wars happening elsewhere -- most recently at Hamilton College, which became embroiled in a debate over a University of Colorado professor's right to call the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks ''little Eichmanns.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harvard being Harvard, any debate it provokes is certain to draw widespread attention. But there is also this crucial difference: the conservative agitator is not an outsider, but an insider. In this case, the president himself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that Mr. Summers thinks of himself as a conservative. He was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and before that, chief economist of the World Bank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's made Mr. Summers so controversial, said Nicholas Lemann, a Harvard graduate and now the dean of Columbia University's journalism school, is that he's conservative ''not in his politics, but in the context of the university.'' ''Just about everything he's done that's gotten attention is about a tug to the center,'' Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is to say, he would like to see R.O.T.C., which was banished from Harvard during the sit-ins of the 60's, restored to campus; he would like to overhaul the core curriculum; he would like to hire who he pleases, regardless of race or sex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By being naturally and deliberately provocative, he has challenged campus liberals, which is not what campus liberals are accustomed to. Neil Rudenstine, the previous president, was a former English major devoted to inclusivity. Derek Bok, who preceded Mr. Rudenstine, was an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> proponent, even writing a book after he left office on the merits of race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, Mr. Summers has had a series of widely reported confrontations: He rebuked Cornel West, a distinguished professor in the African-American studies department, who promptly decamped to Princeton; he made the suggestion, provoked by a pro-Palestinian faction demanding that Harvard divest itself of stock in companies allied with Israel, that campus anti-Semitism was on the rise; he deplored rampant grade inflation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The right attributed his problems to ''feminists'' furthering their ''career agendas,'' as Professor Mansfield put it: ''That he's not in favor of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, that's what this whole thing is about.'' The left complained that he was a dictatorial bully.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the considerable endowment -- now about $23 billion -- is subject to a left-right critique. Liberals want to know why more of that money isn't used for scholarships and faculty research. And why, they ask, are top money managers earning Wall Street-size bonuses? Critics of what some refer to as ''the corporatization of Harvard'' point to the university's acquisition of significant real estate holdings in Allston as symptomatic of the trend. For decades now, Harvard has been buying land across the river from the main campus, and now owns 260 acres there, leaving the university open to the charge that it has pursued a policy of expansion out of sheer acquisitiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Harvard started out as a public school,'' notes Lani Guinier, a Harvard law professor and the author of a forthcoming book titled ''Meritocracy Incorporated.'' ''It was given land by the state of Massachusetts. Harvard was a proprietor of Cambridge, charged with the responsibility of answering to the needs of the community. It's one thing to be the wealthiest landowner in the community, but you have to be responsible.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some extent, the campus rift is not about politics, but about a wrenching of power from the faculty. When Mr. Summers was appointed in 2001, he had, or believed he had, a mandate to make the university more efficient by exerting his control over it. ''He's interested in everything,'' says Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School. ''How it runs its real estate operation, how it manages its food service, how it allocates resources.'' (''Academic freedom is wonderful,'' Mr. Summers has said, ''but it doesn't really have a place in the purchase of cement.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not as if the travails of Lawrence Summers pose any threat to the continuance of the university. Harvard has weathered turbulence before in its 370-year history. Not even the travails of a president who seems to lack a superego can match the drama of that dawn in the spring of 1969 when President Nathan Pusey called in state troopers to oust students who had occupied University Hall; no one present will ever forget the cloud of tear gas wafting over Harvard Yard at five o'clock in the morning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the issues the university faces -- the fate of the new Allston campus, the overhaul of the curriculum, the proper use of the endowment -- are hardly minor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real question isn't whether Mr. Summers should stay or go, but how these inevitable transformations will play out over the next few years. Like it or not, the university over which he presides has been swept into this decade's culture war. There are some things from which not even Harvard is exempt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Adam Palmer)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 46s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2414754878.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Roberts to Trump: Don\u2019t Take the Supreme Court for Granted</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A week of decisions contained hidden and not-so-hidden messages from the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suppose there had been a leak from the Supreme Court early Thursday morning: The court was about to issue its long-awaited decision in the DACA case on the fate of nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers; the vote was 5 to 4; and the majority opinion was by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the leaker didn\u2019t know, or wouldn\u2019t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Critics, of whom there are many, call it an overpriced indulgence for the affluent few who do not have to worry about earning a living upon graduation. Fewer and fewer of today's undergraduates are pursuing the liberal arts, with most of them studying practical subjects like finance, marketing, real estate and pharmacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But James O. Freedman, 67, the retired president of Dartmouth, remains more committed than ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Liberal education opens our eyes to what life is principally about,'' he said. ''It's about understanding yourself and having some resources to deal with everything life throws at you. It's about developing a moral compass and some understanding of how society works, how democracies work.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At home in Cambridge, with his new book, ''Liberal Education and the Public Interest'' (University of Iowa Press, 2003), an ode to the value of liberal education, on the coffee table in front of him, Mr. Freedman makes his case with passion. Contrary to what critics might say, when it comes to getting a job in today's economy, Mr. Freedman says a liberal education is an important advantage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''A liberal education is what teaches people how to write and how to think and makes them much more valuable in the job market over a 40-year career than graduates of a preprofessional program,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''All the employers will tell you that they're seeking the flexibility of mind that a liberal education imbues.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His book came out in January, as he was battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system. The chemotherapy he has been undergoing since September is working.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the fall, with a tumor pressing against the nerves of his lower back, he was using a wheelchair. Now, he needs only a cane to navigate the stairs of the Victorian home he shares with his wife, Sheba.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is Mr. Freedman's fourth bout with cancer since 1994, and just as he writes in his book that a liberal education enables us to see life more clearly, so has he looked clearly at his illness. The odds are that it will return again in a year, he says, and while he hopes to watch his three small grandchildren grow up, he says, there is no way of knowing just how many years he has.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is focusing, as ever, on writing, and speaking out for the liberal values that he has spent his lifetime working for and that he now sees eroding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Life is what we are doing now,'' he writes in his book, reflecting upon the importance of an early commitment to the values of liberal arts, equal education, idealism and public service.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his desk upstairs are a thousand pages of his fourth book: a memoir that moves from his growing up as the son of a high school English teacher in Manchester, N.H., to his undergraduate days at Harvard, where, he says, he was too timid and conventional to be a brilliant student, and on to Yale Law School, where he blossomed intellectually.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The book ends at age 27, when he was a law clerk for Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court justice, one of his heroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman put his knowledge of the law to use recently, when, as a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, he helped prepare a brief for the United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The future of America depends on educating minority men and women,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 11 years as president of Dartmouth, Mr. Freedman devoted himself to making the college welcoming to what he called the creative loners, cellists, poets and mathematicians, as well as athletes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also carved out a role as a public intellectual, standing up to a group of right-wing students -- and their prominent, adult benefactors -- who were ridiculing blacks, homosexuals, women and Jews on campus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making their views known through the neoconservative, off-campus Dartmouth Review, the students ran a front page cartoon that showed Mr. Freedman, who is Jewish, dressed like Adolf Hitler. Eventually, tolerance and civility were restored.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last September, concerned by news reports that Jewish students were being intimidated on campuses amid protests over the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Freedman helped collect signatures from 310 college presidents for a statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. Some presidents criticized the statement for focusing only on Jewish students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With heavy snow falling on the streets of Cambridge, Mr. Freedman was relaxing in his living room, with Sheba, his wife of nearly 40 years, across from him. They were surrounded by some of Mr. Freedman's 2,000 favorite books, by T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, Saul Bellow, Faulkner, Joyce.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lifelong book collector, Mr. Freedman reluctantly parted with 4,000 other favorites when he left Dartmouth -- and the library at the president's house -- for Cambridge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward evening, the doorbell rang. Howard Gardner, the Harvard educational psychologist who is one of Mr. Freedman's closest friends, came in from the snow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In retirement, as an elder statesman of academia, Mr. Freedman's advice is sought frequently. Professor Gardner wanted to consult with him about three academics who needed jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Freedman is ''the ultimate search engine,'' Professor Gardner said, ''because he knows so many people, in so many ways, heart, mind, spirit.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life is unpredictable and full of disappointment, Mr. Freedman writes in his book, the breakup of marriages, death of loved ones, enduring illness. In such a world, he writes, ''how ought one to lead a life?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''That is one of the questions that a liberal education addresses,'' he writes. ''The most effective protection against the contingencies of experience are values that appeal to our very best natures and anchor us most securely in the ocean of fate.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are the kinds of subjects Dr. Donald Kaufman, one of Mr. Freedman's oncologists, says he enjoys discussing with the former college president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''I always reserve 30 minutes for his visits,'' Dr. Kaufman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''They go on for 90. This is for my benefit, not his. He's teaching me what it means to be a patient. He's teaching people how to live.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James O. Freedman, right, the retired president of Dartmouth, with his friend Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist. Mr. Freedman's new book contends that when it comes to getting a job, a well-rounded education is a major advantage. (C. J.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/900173941.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Ugliness Started With Bork</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Oct. 23, 1987 -- 24 years ago on Sunday -- Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court was voted down by the Senate. All but two Democrats voted \"nay.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is \"to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know.\" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a \"wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation\" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the \"systematic demonization\" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb \"to bork,\" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. \"If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,\" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, \"we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose.\" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as \"a right-wing loony,\" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing \"Robert Bork's America\" as a place \"in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,\" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give \"women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, \"Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability.\" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed \"as an extreme ideological activist.\" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 3s "}}

Levy is executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I was chancellor of the New York City schools, I thought that if you were smart and poor, you could write your own ticket to college. I was dead wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new study by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, where I serve as executive director, reveals that only 3 percent of students at our most selective colleges come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the richest 25 percent of families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the fact that once admitted, poor students soar academically. According to our study, the poor students who do attend these elite schools graduate at equal rates and earn similarly high grades as their wealthy peers. The Cooke Foundation awards scholarships to exceptionally high-achieving low-income students; 95 percent of Cooke Scholars graduate from these selective schools with top grades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today at selective colleges we have <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for the wealthy. More than 80 percent of the nation's top higher-education institutions give a \"legacy preference\" to children of alumni. Even the \"athletic preference\" has been warped to give the rich a better shot. Football and basketball - in which poor and minority children excel in large numbers - get the most exposure, but more student-athletes get a leg up at elite institutions in sports such as squash, sailing, crew, horseback riding, fencing and water polo. There aren't many water polo coaches in the New York City school system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The academic playing field is otherwise skewed against smart poor children. The wealthy student gets a tutor (or at least a test-prep course) and can submit his or her best scores to colleges after taking the SAT or ACT multiple times. In contrast, the child of poverty gets a single test-fee waiver and takes the test only once and \"cold.\" (The College Board, to its credit, has sought to address the situation by offering Khan Academy test-prep services at no charge, which, although not the equivalent of one-on-one tutoring, is at least something.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early-admissions programs that require a student to commit to attending a school if accepted also unfairly hold back the poor. Early admission is an easier path to acceptance, worth as much as an extra 100 SAT points, according to one report . But children of poverty can't apply early, because they can't commit to a particular school until they know how much their financial aid package will be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It goes on like this. Students from poverty are also often ill-advised by their high school counselors about college options. Public school counselors are stretched too thin - each advises, on average, hundreds of students - to give each student in-depth attention. So it is hardly surprising that only 23 percent of high-achieving low-income students even apply to a selective school, compared with more than twice as many - 48 percent - high-achieving students from families with higher incomes. As a result, many students are unaware of scholarships they are qualified to receive, and therefore don't apply to these seemingly expensive selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some schools do make attempts to find high-performing low-income students, the overall impact is meager. To reduce the impact of the poverty penalty levied against the brightest low- income students, we need a serious poverty preference in admissions to elite colleges and universities - amounting to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for these students. We do not advocate reducing the role of standardized tests, because admissions officers must have a way to compare students across schools. Without reducing standardized test requirements, admissions officers need to give more credit to low-income students for having achieved at a high level despite not having the advantages of enrichment courses, internships and foreign travel. This would help to level the playing field and open the door of opportunity for academically qualified students to attend schools that match their abilities. It would also provide a backdoor way to maintain ethnic diversity in colleges, particularly if the Supreme Court does away with race-conscious <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in admissions in a case pending this term involving the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When many high-achieving low-income students apply to our nation's top institutions of higher learning, they face a far harder road than more affluent students. Rather than get credit for having successfully overcome obstacles, they face an even more arduous path. All young people in the United States should have a fair chance at academic success, based on true merit, regardless of how much money their parents have. Having wealthy parents doesn't make you smarter or more deserving of college admission. It just means you won the parent lottery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harold O.
