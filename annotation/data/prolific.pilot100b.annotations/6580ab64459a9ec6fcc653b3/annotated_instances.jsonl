Recent anti-Semitic incidents spurred the regents to want to take action, but at their Sept. 17 meeting, they chose not to adopt proposed \"principles against intolerance.\" Instead, they created a committee to consider the issue anew. The reality, however, is that the chance of a breakthrough is low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any written policy would need to achieve conflicting goals: expressing a strong commitment to freedom of speech as an integral aspect of education, while seeking to prevent speech that is racist, sexist, anti-Semitic or homophobic. The trick is in setting the border between heated, even inflammatory, speech and hate speech, which is notoriously difficult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Supreme Court long has held that vague speech rules violate the 1st Amendment and deny due process of law. In fact, efforts at defining hate speech by other state universities have been declared unconstitutional on vagueness grounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Michigan, for example, adopted a code in the 1980s -- later struck down by the Supreme Court -- that prohibited \"any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what does it mean to \"stigmatize\" or \"victimize\"? If a professor or student agues that there are inherent differences between men and women, does that violate the policy? Can advocacy of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> be deemed to violate this policy because it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming that they need preferential treatment to compete?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with principles of intolerance, activists on UC campuses are urging the Board of Regents to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which includes trying to \"demonize Israel,\" \"delegitimize Israel\" or applying a \"double-standard to Israel.\" But who is fit to judge when criticism of Israel's policies and actions veers into demonization? If a student states that Palestinians should have a right of return, is she seeking to delegitimize Israel or just airing a controversial opinion? What if she says the country's founding was a mistake?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the 1st Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea and all viewpoints may be expressed. The 1st Amendment even protects the right to deny the Holocaust or advocate the subjugation of a supposedly inferior group. There unquestionably is a 1st Amendment right to argue against (or for) the existence of Israel or to contend that it should meet (or not have to meet) higher standards of human rights than other nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These difficulties have led some campuses to take a softer approach: adopting community speech guidelines or principles, while pledging not to punish those who violate those principles. Campus administrators can feel that they are taking positive actions without fearing constitutional challenges. Also, they can remind students that just because there is a 1st Amendment right to say something, that doesn't mean it should be said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But such middleground policies always seem to leave everyone dissatisfied. Those who want to prevent hate speech see them as toothless or ineffectual because they cannot be enforced. Those who are most concerned about protecting freedom of expression on campus still worry that they will chill speech and inhibit discussion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a solution to all of this? Is there anything the regents committee and other universities can try?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My advice would be to draft a policy that focuses on reaffirming the importance of free expression while defining what is not constitutionally protected. There is no 1st Amendment right to threaten or harass another person or to deface someone else's property.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The policy should not seek to inhibit or limit protected speech, no matter how offensive it might be. The policy should seek to define, with as much precision as possible, what types of speech and conduct cross the line and are impermissible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should also remember that universities have the right to free speech too, and can and should speak out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community. This, of course, is consistent with the educational mission of universities and a basic principle of the 1st Amendment: the best remedy for the speech we dislike is more speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Erwin Chemerinsky is the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 41s "}}

In other words, that he's a product of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or, more precisely, an \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week, for instance, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: \"I believe in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, but I have to acknowledge there are arguments against it. One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' \"judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote \"incompetent\" or \"unqualified\" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as \"beating back the right wing,\" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land\" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in \"My Grandfather's Son,\" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Thomas said \"that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hires\" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a \"plus factor\" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 47s "}}

It would be nice if CEO Peter Bijur would now lob a few bons mots at journalistic sanctimony, although this seems unlikely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we can still enjoy the larger point: There was a time when journalists aspired to the sensibility of novelists, to some semblance of psychological depth, rather than running around like salivating trolls playing \"gotcha.\" This would have been an excellent opportunity for that earlier breed to assert themselves, given the gift of the tapes -- a fly-on-the-wall peek at real life that every journalist dreams of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course the \"n\" word has become such a taboo, the mere rumor of its utterance becomes a salacious story by itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this case another hackneyed stereotype was thrown into the mix -- EVIL BUSINESSMEN -- and a whole seven-day news conflagration was built on a lie. The transcripts provided by the attorneys, of course, were abysmal. But even the transcripts make it clear that Mr. Ulrich is referring to everyone at Texaco as jelly beans, regardless of color: \"You can't have just `we' and `them.' You can't just have black jelly beans and other jelly beans. It doesn't work.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jelly beans were in the air at Texaco: On an earlier bit of tape, Mr. Lundwall is heard saying \"yum\" and offering a female colleague a jelly bean. (She declines.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even more amazing was the failure to draw on the depth of insight available from the tapes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were secretly recorded by a participant whose motives remain a mystery: Richard Lundwall, a manager in the finance department, was subsequently let go; his tapes seem to consist of random incidents from a day in the life Texaco. We hear him straightening out the matter of a departed employee who may have swiped a laptop. We hear him waxing lyrical over the filet mignon at the Texaco cafeteria. We hear him making nondescript phone calls.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of all, we peer into his department as it wrestles with conflicting goals that should have sent journalistic synapses firing in all directions, awakening the slumbering cognitive organ: downsizing and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the tapes make clear over and over, Texaco's finance department was being prodded from on high to reduce costs by getting rid of bodies. \"We shrink very systematically,\" one manager is heard saying. \"We absorb the job and do a lot of crosstraining.\" In another instance: \"Everybody who leaves, leaves with a smile on their face\" -- referring to the effort to coax people out the door with early retirement and generous severance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also hear survivors comparing their lot with those who left, including some who jumped to Wall Street. This prompts a discussion about the relative advantages of packing your lifetime earnings into a few stress-laden, workaholic years or spreading them out over a 30-year career of easy hours at Texaco.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But along with downsizing, the department was being pushed to upsize minority and female representation. At one point Mr. Lundwall suggests recruiting at \"Howard or Temple or [other] predominantly black schools\" where students are allowed to advance \"simply on the basis of scholastic merit.\" Other MBA programs, he says, are \"under the same gun as corporations\" to promote by quota.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it bothered anybody to be firing colleagues while recruiting minorities, it doesn't show. But there is evidence of stress over race within the organization -- far more interesting and reliable evidence than an indecipherable word that some self-interested lawyer claims is \"nigger.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lundwall jokes about wearing his Viking hat during National Odin Month -- \"I'm celebrating my heritage.\" Then he and Mr. Ulrich riff about the \"black\" national anthem, which evidently some Texaco employees had sung at a company event the previous year. Mr. Lundwall says, \"When they sat during `ours' -- listen to me, during `ours,' as though they're not included -- and stood for their modified one, I apologize to nobody for walking out of there.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What follows is a series of inaudible mumbles and gaps in the recording, out of which supposedly emerged the offensive comment by Mr. Ulrich. But the tone is jocular rather than angry. Elsewhere, Mr. Ulrich can be heard reviewing employment records and remarking with satisfaction on the advancement of women and minorities. And in a discussion of how to talk prospective downsizees out the door, Mr. Ulrich comes across rather well -- sensitive yet realistic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The press might have thrown this evidence onto the scale when weighing whether \"nunjunah\" was really \"nigger.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calls around Texaco last week didn't find anybody willing to say, on the record or off, what sort of guy Mr. Ulrich was, even though Mr. Bijur and the rest worked side by side with him for years. Their desire to duck this question was not hard to fathom: If Mr. Ulrich were a hardened racist, they should have booted him out long ago. If he were a decent guy, defending him now would violate the first rule of post-Tylenol crisis management, which is never defend yourself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, having scored this slamdunk over various Interfaith Councils for Decrying Big Business, the company blithers that the tapes are still \"troubling.\" But Texaco must live in the world, and will certainly cough up generously to settle the lawsuit and become exemplary for its \"diversity\" programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the rest of us, we might conclude that senior executives of Big Oil are honestly at sea over \"diversity\" -- as these tapes clearly reveal -- no less than anyone else is. The muckraking publication Sales & Marketing Management recently pointed out to its readers that \"African-Americans confront stereotypes that make it difficult for them to sell to [white] customers.\" Who could doubt it? And yet the same presumably liberal California voters who plumped heavily for Bill Clinton last week also decided that racial preferences are the wrong solution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the honest uncertainty, perhaps we should accept that there is more to human dignity than twisting ourselves into pretzels of \"sensitivity.\" And keeping a few old goats around at Texaco who remember when the business of an oil company was finding oil, not color-coding jelly beans, may not be such a bad thing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: On the Basis of Merit Only\" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 1996)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 54s "}}

But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it.

{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build.

Things happen. Hillsides erupt. Trends emerge. New stars are born, as old ones are escorted to the quiz shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Change is the one constant of California life, or so sing the gilded poets. And yet at times it seems nothing ever changes at all. Like the poppies, certain plot lines keep coming back again and again, the perennials of the public scene. Like the smog, some never go away at all. Water is one obvious example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The generals of hydraulics are at it again, warring this time over Colorado River water. The stakes, as always, are huge and the details, as always, are complex. The fundamental issue, though, is the same as always: Water, water, who gets the water? There never has been, and never will be, enough water for California--except when it floods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, the politics of the place adhere to familiar patterns. From the earliest days, California vote-seekers have campaigned against the Other. In the mid-1800s, it was \"John,\" code name for the Chinese laborers. There were the Pikes, followed by the Okies, and the Hollywood Reds, and the welfare queens, and Mexican field workers, and the beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Does anyone doubt that, given the mounting political ruckus over the Asian connection, the next election will be a contest to determine which candidates know the fewest Chinese?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This sense of repetition can be annoying to journalists. News is supposed to be a self-defining term, but after the 10th dog is bitten by a boy, the headlines can feel a little too familiar. Cynicism begins to invade the journalistic immune system, a dangerous development in that the truly cynical journalist is but one bad day away from a second career as press agent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All that said, it still seems not at all difficult to imagine what headlines await Californians beyond that bridge to the New Millennium. Five years from now--or 10, 15, 25, even 50 years from now--the news will be full of water wars and wedge issues and O.J. Simpson's new quarters at the rest home. B-1 Bob Dornan, or his lawful heirs, will be demanding a recount. Jerry Brown will be rumored to be contemplating a run for something, anything. Peter Ueberroth will be rumored to be a candidate for a job he doesn't want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A seismic engineer will be expressing concern about the L.A. Coliseum press box. Tunneling for the Metro Red Line will be stalled somewhere under the city. A California councilman will be shown amid the scorched rubble of a canyon, declaring the time has come to crack down on roof shingles. A county supervisor will visit a submerged subdivision, declaring the time has come to crack down on flood plain development. Los Angeles will be fighting over its police chief.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Dodgers will need a third baseman. Al Davis will be threatening to move his Fort Worth Raiders to Frankfurt. Food critics will be predicting that Los Angeles cuisine finally is about to come of age. Sylvester Stallone will announce he is now seeking serious roles. And Liz Taylor will be home from Cedars, weakened by the operation, but holding up well for a 145-year-old. Her fiance will stand at the gate, shooing away paparazzi.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perennials can provide a sense of security. That every spring the feature writers return on schedule to San Juan Capistrano is somehow reassuring. It was comforting to read the other day in the Fresno Bee that San Joaquin Valley raisin growers are about to embark on yet another promotional campaign. Their conviction that the world is but one catchy advertisement away from succumbing to raisin mania has been a staple of reportage in raisinland since William Saroyan was a boy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some never-ending stories, however, grow tedious, as unwelcome as weeds. Tales of the latest gang to terrorize the streets, or the latest crackpot to invade the family planning clinic, or the latest measurement of public school decline--any novelty wore off sad old chestnuts such as these long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, new crops do keep pushing up. Politicians in particular are adept at developing the fresh controversies that news requires. Currently in the state Capitol, debate rages over gambling and how to control card rooms and reservation casinos. This story line holds tremendous evergreen potential, as all sides seem willing to throw huge amounts of cash at the legislators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as combatants are willing to donate, politicians will be willing to debate their issue, on and on, but without conclusion. \"We don't kill milk cows up here,\" is how one Sacramento consultant has described this phenomenon.

On a morning walk, tour guide Karl Walter is moving toward more contemporary events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the walls of Old Jaffa came down in the late 1800s, people started moving to the countryside, he said. Muslims went in one direction, Christians in another. The Jews went north, to a few plots of sand on which they built a school and some houses and started what would become Tel Aviv  --  the first modern Jewish city and a destination for the earliest waves of Zionist immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The city celebrates its centennial this year, its role in the nation changed from point of arrival for emigres to notorious party town and cultural and financial hub  --  a bit Manhattan, a bit L.A., a bit Ibiza, as a morning-to-dusk-to-dawn walk will show.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are those who consider it a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's early Zionist vision  --  a Jewish city, yes, but one that has a strong bohemian streak, that's creative, tolerant and wide open in its politics. There are others who see it as a bit of an abomination, removed from the daily sense of conflict that runs through cities such as Jerusalem and a place, as one Israeli columnist called it, of \"mass Shabbat desecration.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 400,000 people live in the city proper. But close to half of the country's 7 million people live in Tel Aviv's suburbs or nearby coastal towns, so the dichotomy is a reflection not just of the city but of Israel itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tel Aviv  --  where David Ben-Gurion declared the Jewish state's independence  --  has seen its share of violence, including suicide bombings and Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the southern Tel Aviv waterfront, Walter pointed out the stone house that used to belong to one of Jaffa's Arab leaders. It's in a field where, he said, Jewish forces converged in a battle on the eve of Ben-Gurion's declaration. The house is now a museum.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the Arab families were forced out or fled to the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and elsewhere. A few thousand remained, their descendants clustered in Jaffa neighborhoods that have since been incorporated into a combined municipality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as city conservation director Jeremie Hoffman said, the frame of reference is often different here than in other parts of Israel. Tel Aviv residents are as apt to identify with what's happening in New York and Paris as they are with the small towns of Israel, he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hoffman's work is a case in point. In a country defined in some ways by ancient disputes, he is trying to preserve architecture that is only a few decades old  --  the Bauhaus apartments built by immigrants who imported the style from Europe in the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's mid-afternoon, and Hoffman is strolling through downtown neighborhoods where the city has imposed strict rules on renovating hundreds of Bauhaus buildings. The United Nations has designated the area a heritage zone. Apartments that once housed new arrivals are now million-dollar investments. This is not where the new immigrants come anymore  --  it is a second or third step, Hoffman said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, said rising property values are on her mind a lot lately. There's discussion of rent-control laws to ensure the city remains affordable for young people starting their careers as well as middle-class families.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She sips a late-afternoon coffee near Rabin Square, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. The world's focus more often rests on Jerusalem, she said, but she's among those who will tell you that Tel Aviv is the heart of Israel's story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This was Herzl's idea of what the Jewish land should be  --  secular, liberal, pluralistic,\" she said, citing the city's efforts to boost welfare benefits, care for the homeless, and encourage tolerance toward gays and other minorities. She winces a bit when asked about the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, though she said the city has <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies for hiring Israeli Arabs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Tel Aviv is seen as very left-wing, but it keeps its distance,\" Arab mayoral candidate Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka said during her campaign. Redevelopment of some of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, she said, risked gentrifying the few Arab sections that remain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She did not receive many votes, but one person who supported her was writer Avner Bernheimer, who felt putting an Arab woman in charge of the city might stir things up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is just past sundown on Friday night, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Jerusalem and other more conservative towns are locked up tight to observe the day of rest. In Tel Aviv, it's the start of a party that will run into the early hours.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernheimer and his partner, architect Eran Neuman, are talking over dinner about their projects. Bernheimer is writing a television movie about human trafficking through the Sinai desert. Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning. There are discos, clubs and bars tucked into so many alleys. People line up for the most popular.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Blackbook, two men in NBA jerseys and Elvis wigs are waving sex toys in the face of an unfortunate friend celebrating a birthday. At club Haarbaa, around the corner, Yair Gafni is a natural host. He treats everyone like his long-lost friend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearing sunrise, fruit bats nibble at the ficus trees.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1774364135.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Affirmative action for conservatives?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even though we are conservative professors, we've argued publicly that conservative attacks on universities are too often overheated and counterproductive. Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: \"I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do.\" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: \"If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered \"out of a multitude of tongues.\" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its \"uncomfortable learning\" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

Sure, there are ultra-right elements in the Republican Party, particularly in the South. But in New York City, particularly in Manhattan where she lives, she knows that, if anything, the Republican Party tends to be liberal to ultra-liberal. Why was the New York State Conservative Party formed in the 1960's? To provide New York voters an alternative to liberal Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller, John Lindsay and Jacob Javits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the so-called right-wing Republican convention in 1992, which I also attended as an alternate delegate, allowed Mary Fisher, the AIDS activist, to address the gathering. The Democrats would not allow Gov. Robert P.

Being a Chicagoan whose tax dollars helped purchase the microphones, transmitters and speakers via which these hateful, hurtful words have been broadcast, being a Chicagoan whose taxes evidently pay the wages of bigots, that's injury added to the insult.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, Chicago has been rocked by charges that some of its firefighters aren't comfortable serving many of the people who live here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The five racist radio transmissions of recent weeks have generated more shock than surprise. The transmissions didn't occur in a void. They follow more than three decades of tension within the department since its ranks were belatedly integrated in 1968.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of that tension over the years has stayed within the city's firehouses. On rare occasion, citizens have been able to peer inside, or to listen from afar. What they've seen and heard isn't always ennobling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, a videotape surfaced depicting a 1990 firehouse retirement party at which firefighters were drinking, exposing themselves and uttering racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the firefighters who attended the party, James McNally, now is president of Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. On another occasion, he appeared in black face to protest promotions motivated by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to say most Chicago firefighters condone racism. But firefighters--provocateurs and innocents alike--do need to appreciate how grave these five radio incidents are, as is the delivery of a death threat to a battalion chief who heads the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are times, particularly when the offenders are young or ignorant, when ugly behavior can be forgiven if not forgotten, when its perpetrators can be redeemed if not encouraged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not one of those times. This behavior, in this department, in this city, is intolerable. There is no wellspring of goodwill upon which an offending firefighter can call, no margin for middling penance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simply put, these disgusting, dehumanizing incidents follow too much history. Fire Commissioner James Joyce declared last week that \"offenses like these will be fireable offenses.\" Translation: Joyce has committed himself to judging each case individually, but he has put every one of his employees on notice that the range of penalties unquestionably includes dismissal. Mayor Richard Daley concurred, stating that a still unidentified person--thought to be a firefighter--who voiced racial slurs broadcast March 1 should admit his action and face the \"ultimate consequences.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the correct response. When these kinds of calculated affronts to city and department policy occur, when reasonable citizens are left to wonder about the integrity of the firefighters they employ, jobs should--must--be on the line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Joyce can fulfill his own prophecy is another matter. The department terminated seven firefighters who appeared in the 1990 videotape. They challenged the dismissals before an arbitrator and eventually won back their jobs--with pension and seniority rights, the department says, although without four years of back pay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Merely identifying whoever has been spewing filth on fire department frequencies isn't easy. One veteran firefighter who voiced racist slander, and a supervisor who didn't react properly, have been suspended over the first of the five incidents. It's likely the subsequent transmissions originated on fire department radios, but in this era of clever hackers and electronic gadgetry, the department isn't yet certain that no outsider is involved. Joyce, though, hasn't sounded like a boss who expects to learn that his own employees are innocent. Last week he denounced an \"underground Web site\" that offered firefighters tips on how to obscure their identities when transmitting over department frequencies. \"That's what we're up against,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also up against an unmeasured amount of denial over society's gradual progress on race. Many of today's Chicago firefighters did come of age in a department culture that to varying degrees rewarded three attributes: skill, courage and clout. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, though, is about a fourth, and to some foreign, attribute: fairness. It's understandable, if not admirable, that adding fairness to the mix caused resentment among those who feel that the long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities--a cause Joyce has advanced--is unfair to some whites who don't get those promotions. What's not understandable is for any Chicago firefighter to permit that or any other frustration to be voiced in the most vicious bigotry imaginable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Firefighters who don't share that bigotry are now in the best position to lead the department out of its difficult past. One important step is to help nail the perpetrators of the radio incidents. Public racism tends to be a team sport. It's likely someone inside or outside the department knows who originated these broadcasts. Stepping forward with that knowledge may require even more courage than racing into a burning house.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But restoring the department's integrity, like rescuing fire victims, is a critical public service. And that cause, public service, should be key to how this sorry drama concludes. Any firefighter who merely wants to fight fire is free to resign and join the U.S. Forest Service. Any firefighter who wants to serve the public--in all its varied hues, in its wide range of good and bad behaviors, in its terrible moments when disaster strikes and panic ensues--is welcome to stay.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if a firefighter finds himself risking his own life to save the lives of Chicagoans he finds unworthy of his respect, he should find another job. Fire Commissioner Joyce is right to pursue those few who've let that lack of respect get the best of them. The hope here is that he will root them out, adjudicate their cases under the due process to which they're entitled--and subject them to the ultimate consequences Mayor Daley properly threatened last week.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 23s "}}
