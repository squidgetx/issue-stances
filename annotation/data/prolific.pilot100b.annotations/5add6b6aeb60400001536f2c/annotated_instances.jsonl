We want an equal shot regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or disability, and in this nation of laws that should be assured. But like the speed limit, such laws mean nothing unless they are strictly enforced, so a proposal by the Clinton administration to boost civil rights enforcement could make a real difference. Employers, contractors, mortgage lenders and landlords would make more decisions in a truly impartial manner if failure to do so had surer and quicker consequences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That racial barriers persist is unquestionable. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent against a 1995 decision concerning <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, was eloquent in describing them: \"Racial inequality . . . and discrimination's lingering effects . . . are evident in our workplaces, markets and neighborhoods. Job applicants with identical resumes, qualifications, and interview styles still experience different receptions, depending on their race. White and African American consumers still encounter different deals. People of color looking for housing still face discriminatory treatment by landlords, real estate agents and mortgage lenders.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House plan, if approved by Congress, would increase civil rights funding 17%, from $516 million to $602 million. Some Republicans may object to any increase in government. The political opposition is harder to figure. How can opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, who say they only want equal opportunity, reject tougher enforcement of existing laws enforcing equality?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A current barrier to enforcement is the overworked, underbudgeted and understaffed federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Clinton proposal would increase funding by $37 million to reduce the backlog of 64,000 cases and encourage more use of mediation, which is a quicker and less costly method of resolving disputes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's civil rights division, overseer of laws governing employment, housing, education and public accommodations, would get an 11% funding increase. To discourage housing bias, the White House would increase Housing and Urban Development Department funding by $22 million, among other things making possible the hiring of more \"testers\"--applicants identical on paper but of different racial backgrounds. Their visits to landlords and real estate agents often uncover wide disparities and are the best possible measure of compliance with fair housing laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton seeks to engage the nation in a debate on the divisive issue of race. Dialogue is important, but actions speak louder. Strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws will give more people the fair shot that each of us deserves.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,\" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,\" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The court operates according to a different rule,\" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. \"There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,\" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. \"He may still be finding things out himself.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's \"median voter,\" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, \"the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}
{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

This has sparked much Monday- morning quarterbacking among industry groups and industry-funded folks as to what went wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This issue should have been a 'gimme' for the administration,\" former Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Jonathan Adler e-mailed CEI President Fred Smith last week, insisting the merits of the issue favored the White House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Despite this . . . the administration got hammered and will continue to get hammered,\" Adler said, by enviros and \"pundits who know less about environmental law than [Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd] Whitman (and that's saying something).\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem? \"Poor communication,\" writes Adler. That plus \"the utter intellectual vacuity and laziness of environmental journalists,\" he said. \"If the arsenic issue cannot be 'won,' it will be hard to win anything that matters.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus the quick turnaround on the pro-salmonella proposal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adler's e-mail notes people should have stressed that there were \"no industry beneficiaries\" in voiding the Clinton move and that there was still a federal arsenic regulation in place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enviros such as Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, however, insists the problem was that the facts didn't back the Bush team. Negin said, for example, the Environmental Arsenic Council, a trade group of chemical, oil and mining companies, staunchly opposed the new standard already adopted by the Europeans - - and the old federal standard was adopted in 1942, before it was known that arsenic was a carcinogen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, Adler may be right about this. People cringe at the word \"arsenic.\" Industry must level the playing field and rename arsenic. Perhaps \"Rosewater?\" Or \"Passion Mist?\" Maybe \"Old Lace?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened to those guys who came up with \"fecal matter?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And now, the first of a likely endless string of fundraisers and political to-dos at the Clinton home in Northwest. Our invite from all the Democratic women senators says they're holding a \"special reception honoring\" Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who's pretty much broke these days and owes a large chunk of change from her campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's on April 25 and only $1,000 a ticket. But there's a problem for all those well-heeled PAC folks. It's \"Personal checks only.\" So if you want to see maison Clinton and those new decorations, it's going to come out of your pocket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Remember the Dan Burton cuff links on eBay for $9.99 that got no bids for five days? Sold! For $50.86 after 21 bids, to a bidder named \"fostervince.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush said Friday that he would name Charles A. Heimbold Jr., deputy chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, to be ambassador to Sweden.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the early front-runner for Rome, Rockwell Schnabel, is said to have faded of late, and Charles Gargano, a favorite of the Italian American lobby, is moving out front. Another name heard in the mix is former New Jersey representative William J. Martini (R).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Roger Noriega, a top aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), is said to be the front- runner for ambassador to the Organization of American States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> here, the Bush administration says, but even so, 40 percent of Bush's announcements for top-tier positions -- those requiring Senate confirmation -- have been women and minorities, according to a review of Bush's first 158 picks by the Brookings Presidential Appointee Initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About 25 percent of Bush's picks have been women and 20 percent are minorities: 11.4 percent are African American, 3.2 percent are Hispanic and 5.1 percent are Asian.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This compares to President Clinton's 37 percent women and 15 percent African Americans, according to a 1993 Knight Ridder study.

Many people I interact with outside my job don\u2019t even know that I am a professor, or that I have a doctoral degree. When I introduce myself in public, I\u2019m Carlotta Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I introduce myself in the classroom, I\u2019m Dr. Berry. And I insist on being Dr. Berry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Titles in the academy are inconsistent at best. I have colleagues who would prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames like \u201cBone Saw.\u201d But they are mostly men, and almost all white, and they have that luxury. As an African-American woman in a mostly Caucasian- and male-dominated field, I don\u2019t.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some find my insistence on this formality a bit pretentious or arrogant. But they don\u2019t understand my story, and that of many other women and people of color in the academy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having worked with thousands of students, I know for a fact that for many \u2014 though by no means all, or even most \u2014 there is already a presumption that I, as a female and African-American, am less qualified than my white male colleagues, or at the very least that I was hired in order to meet a double minority quota. And I get it \u2014 anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> ideologues have managed to not only demolish the legitimacy of that policy, but tar the reputation of anyone who might have benefited from it (even if, like me, they did not).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How do I know? Sometimes it\u2019s just a sense, a feeling I get from people\u2019s tone of voice. But some students will automatically call me Ms., while naturally referring to my male counterparts as Doctor or Professor. I\u2019m not alone: When I meet fellow female engineering professors at conferences, this sort of treatment is always a topic of conversation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In class, I have my derivations questioned, lectures critiqued, grading regarded as too harsh or unfair and my expectations dismissed as too high or difficult. I once had a student who would review notes with me that he had taken on my lecture, then offer tips on how I could improve. It seems he thought he was doing me a favor, despite the fact that I had been teaching for six years by then. I doubt that this is an experience that many of my male colleagues have ever had to endure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On other occasions, I have had students state that it is difficult to follow my lectures because of my dialect or slang (neither of which I have, or use).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what can I do? I already have to run faster and jump higher just to gain that minimal level of respect that my colleagues are graciously, automatically afforded. But I can also insist that my students interact with me in a professional manner, even if it\u2019s not something they\u2019re accustomed to in other classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I tell friends outside the academy about these challenges, they\u2019re often surprised. It\u2019s 2014, and this is higher education, where enlightened worldviews are supposed to dominate. But consider that according to data from the American Society for Engineering Education, as of 2011 African-American women made up 4 percent of all women in the engineering professoriate. Between 2001 and 2012, the number of African-American engineering faculty members increased to 3 percent from 2 percent. In all, in 2012 there were only 140 African-American women working as engineering professors \u2014 out of some 24,640 across the entire field (not including computer engineering).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For me, this statistical desert is made even more stark by the fact that, at a private school in a Midwestern town like mine, students may have interacted with African-Americans only in the service industry, or in high school, with female teachers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I decided to become an engineering professor 20 years ago while sitting in class and realizing that I had never had a professor who looked like me, acted like me or even seemed interested in me. I was typically one of only two or three female students, and one of only one or two African-American students. I wanted to change the face of engineering by showing that the profession could be cool, interesting, exciting, engaging and, most important, diverse. In that way, insisting that students use my title isn\u2019t just about me \u2014 it\u2019s about broadcasting, to any female and black students who might hear it, that I am black, a woman, and an engineer, and that they can be the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I enter my classroom today, I am still one of only two or three women in my department (depending on how you count the faculty), and I am one of only one or two African-Americans. Still, I hope that someday, when an African-American woman walks into an engineering classroom, the students recognize that the professor has arrived, and that she won\u2019t have to insist on their calling her Doctor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}

It's way past time for him to accept the fact that there's a new wunderkind in town.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as Bill Clinton looks at Obama and sees his own oblivion, so does Jesse Jackson. As Shelby Steele wrote in The Wall Street Journal, Jackson and his generation of civil rights leaders \"made keeping whites 'on the hook' the most sacred article of the post-'60s black identity,\" equality pursued by manipulating white guilt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now John McCain is pea-green with envy. That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad was \"kinda stupid.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with Newsweek's Jonathan Alter: \"It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"John's eaten up with envy,\" said one. \"His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Now somebody else is the celebrity,\" the colleague continued, while John looks in the mirror and sees his face marred by skin cancer and looks at the TV and sees his dashing self-image replaced by visions of William Frawley, with Letterman jokes about his membership in the ham radio club and adventures with wagon trains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama \"hasn't bled.\" He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to \"brush him back.\" Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. \"I guess I beaned him instead,\" Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408580425.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Colorblind Conservatives?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I suppose it's easier to get engrossed in a subplot when the main story line has become fairly obvious. Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is \"no,\" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the \"religious right\"--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}

Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 38s "}}

All but two Democrats voted \"nay.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rejection of a Supreme Court nominee is unusual but not unheard of (see Clement Haynsworth Jr.). But rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree -- and intellectual firepower -- of Bork. He had been a law professor at Yale, the solicitor general of the United States and, at the time Ronald Reagan tapped him for the court, a federal appeals court judge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Bork was a legal intellectual, a proponent of original intent and judicial restraint. The task of the judge, he once wrote, is \"to discern how the framers' values, defined in the context of the world they knew, apply to the world we know.\" He said that Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, was a \"wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation\" of authority that belonged to the states, that the court's recent rulings on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> were problematic and that the First Amendment didn't apply to pornography.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever you think of these views, they cannot be fairly characterized as extreme; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among many others, has questioned the rationale offered by the court to justify Roe v. Wade. Nor was Bork himself an extremist. He was a strongly opinionated, somewhat pugnacious, deeply conservative judge. (At 84 today, he hasn't mellowed much either, to judge from an interview he recently gave Newsweek.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I bring up Bork not only because Sunday is a convenient anniversary. His nomination battle is also a reminder that our poisoned politics is not just about Republicans behaving badly, as many Democrats and their liberal allies have convinced themselves. Democrats can be -- and have been -- every bit as obstructionist, mean-spirited and unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take it one step further. The Bork fight, in some ways, was the beginning of the end of civil discourse in politics. For years afterward, conservatives seethed at the \"systematic demonization\" of Bork, recalls Clint Bolick, a longtime conservative legal activist. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution coined the angry verb \"to bork,\" which meant to destroy a nominee by whatever means necessary. When Republicans borked the Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright less than two years later, there wasn't a trace of remorse, not after what the Democrats had done to Bork. The anger between Democrats and Republicans, the unwillingness to work together, the profound mistrust -- the line from Bork to today's ugly politics is a straight one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is, to be sure, completely understandable that the Democrats wanted to keep Bork off the court. Lewis Powell, the great moderate, was stepping down, which would be leaving the court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. There was tremendous fear that if Bork were confirmed, he would swing the court to the conservatives and important liberal victories would be overturned -- starting with Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But liberals couldn't just come out and say that. \"If this were carried out as an internal Senate debate,\" Ann Lewis, the Democratic activist, would later acknowledge, \"we would have deep and thoughtful discussions about the Constitution, and then we would lose.\" So, instead, the Democrats sought to portray Bork as \"a right-wing loony,\" to use a phrase in a memo written by the Advocacy Institute, a liberal lobby group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The character assassination began the day Bork was nominated, when Ted Kennedy gave a fiery speech describing \"Robert Bork's America\" as a place \"in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters,\" and so on. It continued until the day the nomination was voted down; one ad, for instance, claimed, absurdly, that Bork wanted to give \"women workers the choice between sterilization and their job.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives were stunned by the relentlessness -- and the essential unfairness -- of the attacks. But the truth is that many of the liberals fighting the nomination also knew they were unfair. That same Advocacy Institute memo noted that, \"Like it or not, Bork falls (perhaps barely) at the borderline of respectability.\" It didn't matter. He had to be portrayed \"as an extreme ideological activist.\" The ends were used to justify some truly despicable means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, of course, the court has a conservative majority, and liberal victories are, indeed, being overturned. Interestingly, Bolick says Bork's beliefs would have made him a restraining force. Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush, also pointed out that after Bork, nominees would scarcely acknowledge that they had rich and nuanced judicial philosophies for fear of giving ammunition to the other side. Those philosophies would be unveiled only after they were on the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mostly, though, the point remains this: The next time a liberal asks why Republicans are so intransigent, you might suggest that the answer lies in the mirror.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
