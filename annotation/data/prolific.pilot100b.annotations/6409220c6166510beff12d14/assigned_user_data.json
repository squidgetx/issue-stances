Neuman has put together one of the centennial celebration's centerpiece displays, a futuristic look at Tel Aviv in which ideas from architecture schools worldwide are pictured on brightly lit, inflatable triangles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But some of the most animated talk over dinner is of their  3-month-old son  --  the mother is a college friend of Neuman's, and Bernheimer is the biological father. Just as it was built on refugees from Europe, they say, Tel Aviv today is a result of its openness  --  to gays, to people with different ideas about politics or art, to those with ambitions they feel they can fulfill here.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Friday night becomes Saturday morning.

One of the more cogent is the presence of Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robinson's comment echoes many previous attacks. In 2000, for example, Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen -- another liberal who has written in support of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- declared that Thomas' \"judicial resume was mediocre; he was chosen because he was conservative and black, an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire by an administration that eschewed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many liberal Democrats aren't willing to say out loud what Robinson and Quindlen wrote so clearly. After all, they're conditioned to defend racial preferences, which they insist do not promote \"incompetent\" or \"unqualified\" people. But that doesn't mean they don't think it. Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as \"beating back the right wing,\" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land\" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in \"My Grandfather's Son,\" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Thomas said \"that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hires\" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a \"plus factor\" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Who's the hypocrite?; It's not fair to use affirmative action against Clarence Thomas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the release of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' memoir, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" all of the old smears directed against him since his confirmation hearings 16 years ago are once again being trotted out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That he's \"incompetent.\" That he's \"not qualified.\" That the only reason he was appointed is because he's black.

Even The American Prospect magazine, a liberal journal that sees its mission as \"beating back the right wing,\" ran an article two years ago calling Thomas the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land, a token black nominee whose lack of qualifications was so painfully outed during his confirmation hearings.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can you support a policy of racial preferences and then attack one of its supposed beneficiaries as undeserving? This, ultimately, is the intrinsic hypocrisy of the Thomas bashers. They allege that he's not competent and that the only reason he became a Supreme Court justice was because he's black. And in so doing, they level the exact same arguments against Thomas that they castigate conservatives for making about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> itself. But let's face facts: A program that gives people with a certain skin color an advantage will invariably reward some who would otherwise not qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This blatant intellectual inconsistency does not stop Thomas' liberal critics from accusing him of hypocrisy -- namely, for being the \"most visible <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire in all the land\" while simultaneously standing as its most prominent black opponent. By opposing racial preferences, liberals say, Thomas -- who was accepted into Yale Law School via an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program -- is denying others the very same benefits he received.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Thomas reveals in \"My Grandfather's Son,\" his opposition to racial preferences is based on personal conscience and a genuine concern for its effects on black Americans, not selfish disregard for his racial brethren born out of self-loathing, as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates would have it. He writes that he keeps his Yale diploma tucked away in his basement with a 15-cent cigar sticker affixed to its frame. Why? In a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Thomas said \"that degree meant one thing for whites and another thing for blacks. . . . It was discounted.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one of the tragic legacies of racial preferences -- that the achievements of black people in the professional world will always be suspect, and not just to blacks who benefit from such preferences. In the minds even of liberals, blacks will always be thought of as \"<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hires\" no matter how bright or qualified they are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be difficult for well-intentioned white liberals to understand the personal insecurity that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> causes, and as a white person, I can only take someone like Thomas at his word when he writes about the shame he feels because of racial preferences. But as a gay man, I can certainly empathize, as I imagine I would feel exactly the same way if sexual orientation became a \"plus factor\" in a law school or employment application process. Factoring in a person's immutable traits demeans them and robs them of their individuality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether or not Thomas is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, who are <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> advocates to smear him as an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hire? (Can you imagine a left-wing magazine like The American Prospect saying that about a liberal black judge? It would never happen.) But if they honestly believe Thomas is one, then they only have themselves to blame for a rotten system that privileges some people over others because of skin pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the day his Supreme Court nomination was announced by President George H.W. Bush, Thomas' critics have personally and viciously attacked him as if he were an abstraction -- representing everything they hate about minorities (whether women, gays or blacks) who do not subscribe to their liberal nostrums -- and, in so doing, have sucked him of his humanity as an individual. If liberals want to live up to their self-purported principles of equality and free inquiry, they would do well to stop treating Clarence Thomas as the scapegoat for their political agendas and start treating him like a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:David Suter For The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James Kirchick is on the editorial staff of The New Republic.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1919844871.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1919844871.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>Is there bias on our ballots?

After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, \"Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\" and \"I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\"But Ms. Smith wasn't the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \"cognitive diversity\" is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of -- individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \"biological causes.\" It included the line, \"Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\"To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won't do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it's already achieved.If our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016.

The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity -- including cognitive diversity -- must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016. Employees typically recommend people similar to them in racial identity and gender, so it requires dedicated effort to recruit and hire people who don't already have identities that match up with those of current employees. Counting up variations of \"viewpoints\" -- however one might do so -- won't achieve that. And, to potential applicants from underrepresented groups, statements about \"cognitive diversity\" will send an unwelcoming message about a company's real priorities for inclusion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my former Facebook colleague Regina Dugan said recently, even if cognitive diversity is a company's ultimate goal, \"we can't step away from the idea that diversity also looks like identity diversity.\" The effort to hire people with different points of view must not come at the expense of hiring members of actual underrepresented communities who add tangible, bottom-line value -- and who deserve to work in tech as much as anyone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \"Our commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it's ever been.\" That kind of diversity -- the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive -- is what I hope my industry won't abandon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>BARI A.
