The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "displayed_text": "<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem?

They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/432991807.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/432991807.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>The Battle Behind the Battle at Harvard</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Atlas is the president of Atlas Books.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WHEN Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard, theorized last month at a conference on ''Diversifying the Science and Engineering Work Force'' that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude, he could scarcely have anticipated the protests that unfolded last week on the university's campus.

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as \"race-norming\" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring \"goal\" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising \"targets of diversity\" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for \"underrepresented\" junior faculty. And \"parity goals\" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. \"At first, you think it's you,\" he said. \"You blame yourself.\" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, \"Let's face it, you're not the right color.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken \"reasonable\" voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to remedy \"deficiencies\" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. \"A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,\" complained a California state middle-management worker. \"We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: \"My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists.\" Another teacher noted: \"I found out what it was like to be a victim.

Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up.

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as \"race-norming\" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring \"goal\" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising \"targets of diversity\" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for \"underrepresented\" junior faculty. And \"parity goals\" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. \"At first, you think it's you,\" he said. \"You blame yourself.\" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, \"Let's face it, you're not the right color.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken \"reasonable\" voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to remedy \"deficiencies\" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. \"A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,\" complained a California state middle-management worker. \"We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: \"My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists.\" Another teacher noted: \"I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.

From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers.

But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. \"Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' \" he recalled. \" 'How do you think you can make it there?' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs. \"The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' \" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of \"The Big Test,\" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people \"more like us\" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. \"It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,\" Professor Gates said. \"We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a \"teachable moment.\" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of \"The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,\" Professor Gates said. \"We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a \"teachable moment.\" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of \"The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

In an unprecedented move on the first day, Democrats tried to shut down the hearing by complaining that Republicans were withholding documents about Kavanaugh's record. Republicans accused Democrats of political grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was all over, the highly qualified and reliably conservative judge was headed for approval in the Senate Judiciary Committee, albeit with Republican votes only.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This surely has been the most contentious hearing since [Clarence] Thomas\" in 1991, said University of Georgia law professor Lori Ringhand, who has written a history of court confirmation hearings. \"Cooperation among the committee members seems to have completely broken down.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She said the hearing continued the trend of revealing less and less about a nominee's views. \"Kavanaugh seemed to provide firm answers to even fewer substantive questions than [Justice Neil M.] Gorsuch, who provided fewer firm answers than any nominee for decades. In my opinion, this strips the process of much of its value.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Thomas confirmation in 1991 had stood alone as unusually contentious for two reasons. Thomas was a 43-year-old black conservative with a thin record when he was tapped to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights legend. And after a week of hearings, the public learned that Anita Hill, a former aide, had accused him of sexual harassment. Nonetheless, Thomas won confirmation on a 52-48 vote in a Senate controlled by Democrats. He then joined a court where most of the justices had won unanimous Senate confirmation, including Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, there has been a steady decline in the number of senators who will cross party lines to confirm a high court nominee. In 1993, President Clinton's first nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, won with a 96-3 vote. In 2005, President George W. Bush's first nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., won on a 78-22 vote. In 2009, President Obama's first nominee, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, won on a 68-31 vote. And last year, Gorsuch, President Trump's first nominee, won by a 54-45 vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was the lone Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to support Obama's nominees. On Thursday, he bemoaned the raucous partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"People wonder,\" he said, \"are these hearings turning into a circus?\" But Graham said this was not fair nor accurate. \"Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people.\" He referred to the regular shout-outs from protesters who were dragged from the hearing room.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators from both major parties often speak of their desire for a \"neutral\" judge who will simply follow the law and rule fairly without bias. But their actions tell a different story.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All the Republicans joined together in 2016 to block even a hearing for a highly qualified Obama nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now all the Democrats, at least on the committee, are united in their opposition to Kavanaugh to fill the seat of the recently retired Kennedy, the high court's swing justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative scholars credited Kavanaugh with a strong, steady performance amid the partisan squabbling. \"He is an experienced, thoughtful and intelligent mainstream judicial conservative. I do not believe we learned anything new about him, but we have learned a bit about the new normal in terms of collegiality in the Senate and the depth of activists' frustration with the administration,\" said Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Women's rights advocates and liberal scholars were not reassured by his testimony. \"Our fears about the future of this country deepened this week when Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer questions about his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration and healthcare. Our civil rights, dignity and autonomy will be in grave danger if he is confirmed,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, pointed to the jarring contrast between Kavanaugh's public praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education school desegregation ruling and his private White House memos deriding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies. \"Seeing him use words like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' to refer to race-conscious measures intended to redress entrenched systemic racism is upsetting,\" Wydra said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump promised to appoint justices who would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to choose abortion, and Democrats pressed Kavanaugh to explain his views. He repeatedly said Roe was a \"precedent,\" but would not say it was correctly decided.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he described the 1974 ruling in United States vs. Nixon, which required the president to turn over the Watergate tapes, as correct and one of the great moments in the court's history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cornell law professor Michael Dorf was a clerk for Kennedy in 1992, when the court reaffirmed the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, and said Kavanaugh's comments did not signal he would uphold abortion rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Understood in context, he said very little,\" Dorf said, except that Roe and Casey are precedents. \"There is good reason to think that in addition to Justice Thomas, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices [Samuel A.] Alito and Gorsuch would overrule Roe if presented with the opportunity,\" he said. If so, he said, Kavanaugh could supply the fifth vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When asked about same-sex marriage, Kavanaugh took a different approach that may be significant. He spoke of a passage from Kennedy's opinion in June in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case that endorsed equal rights for gays and lesbians. Kavanaugh noted correctly that nearly all the justices, including the leading conservatives, signed the opinion, which -- as he paraphrased it -- said that \"the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans, or gay and lesbian couples, as second-class citizens or inferior in dignity or worth are over in the Supreme Court. That's a very important statement.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had asked him to say whether the 2015 ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage was correctly decided. It is a \"yes or no\" question, she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kavanaugh refused to answer, repeating his statement that a nominee should not give a \"thumbs-up or thumbs-down\" response to recent rulings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leading gay rights advocates said they were not reassured. They noted the court in the Masterpiece case ruled that the Colorado cake maker was treated unfairly based on his Christian beliefs. Sharon McGowan, a lawyer for the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, said Kavanaugh's \"bobbing and weaving to avoid endorsing Obergefell speaks volumes. It signals not only to us, but also to his most fervent supporters, that he is prepared to grant religious opt-outs from nondiscrimination laws that are designed to protect LGBT people and their families.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the next year, the court is likely to take up another religious rights case, possibly from a florist in western Washington state who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The court's conservatives are likely to look favorably on her claim for a religious exemption from the state's civil rights law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no sign the court's conservatives are interested in revisiting the issue of same-sex marriage. Abortion remains highly disputed, and several Republican-led states are likely to enact bans on abortion that will send the issue back before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, conservative lawmakers are not pressing to enact new bans on same-sex marriage, and as Kavanaugh's comment suggested, there is no reason to believe such a challenge would be welcome at the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>david.savage@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: BRETT KAVANAUGH takes a break Thursday from his confirmation hearing with former players of a youth basketball team he coached.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>ANALYSIS; Senate testimony insights; Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing shows growing partisanship, but reveals little about his views on the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week's Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lived up to -- or perhaps down to -- expectations for how modern-day justices are confirmed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A sharp partisan divide was on display from the first minute and lasted until the bitter end.
