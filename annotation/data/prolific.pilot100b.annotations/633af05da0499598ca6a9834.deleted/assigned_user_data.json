Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal commentator, put it exactly: ''The Senate's vote and the smearing of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.''</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Abroad at Home; Hypocrites in Power</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been contemptible Congresses before, and historians can argue about which was worst.

The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal commentator, put it exactly: ''The Senate's vote and the smearing of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and partisanship.''</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409060590.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409060590.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>Ashcroft The Activist</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the nominee is technically qualified for the job and is, moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole thing seems to be missing the point.

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, \"Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,\" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation \"undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation \"across racial and cultural lines.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,\" Reed said. \"I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative.

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, \"Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,\" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation \"undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation \"across racial and cultural lines.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,\" Reed said. \"I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative.

This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination.

Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.

Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.
