The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was \u201cuncowed,\u201d the chief justice wrote, despite being \u201cphysically threatened.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cA judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was \u201cuncowed,\u201d the chief justice wrote, despite being \u201cphysically threatened.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cA judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination.

When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty.
