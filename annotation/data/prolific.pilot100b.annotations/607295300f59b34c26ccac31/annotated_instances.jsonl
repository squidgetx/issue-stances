Or perhaps I've slipped into another dimension where perceptions are altered, where lies are truth, where yes means no, or the meaning of \"is\" is debatable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last Wednesday was one of those days. I was reading a New York Times columnist's accounting of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner honoring him, and I wondered whether someone had spiked my water with some reality-altering chemical at my table.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the reliably witty Maureen Dowd described Thomas' speech as \"bellicose,\" \"self-pitying\" and \"self-aggrandizing,\" I described the same speech to friends as inspiring. Maybe it was the stirring rendition of \"America the Beautiful\" (I'm a shameless sucker for patriotic songs.), but I seem to have heard a different speech altogether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true, as Dowd pointed out, that the 1,600-person crowd was mostly white; that red meat was served and, presumably, eaten; that Thomas talked and talked and talked. But it is also true that no one stirred or so much as cleared his throat during the hour-long speech. And true, too, that Thomas' standing ovation at the end was longer than is required by politeness and more spontaneous than one might naturally expect of a crowd merely tired of sitting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From which I must infer that others in the throng heard the message of \"duty, honor, country\" as I did--as values worthy of the trenches and of our occasional discomfort. Nothing he said evoked \"comparisons to Bill Clinton's defense for pardoning Marc Rich when he said it was easy to say no and took courage to say yes,\" as Dowd wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It doesn't take courage to pardon an unscrupulous criminal in exchange for political favors and possibly huge sums of money, though corruption helps. It does take courage, on the other hand, to fight for your principles, to stand by your convictions, to tell the truth in your heart, as Thomas recommended throughout his speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what Thomas really talked about, even as he acknowledged some personal understanding of these matters. He mentioned having experienced the firing line, from his Supreme Court confirmation hearings through media portrayals that were painful. He spoke, too, of his experiences as a black man who dares to question such \"black\" issues as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, school busing and welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Those who come to engage in debates of consequence, and who challenge accepted wisdom, should expect to be treated badly,\" he said. On issues of race, \"there was no real debate or honest discussion. When whites questioned the conventional wisdom on these issues, it was considered bad form; when blacks did so, it was treason.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Honest people know these words to be true, yet some would revile Thomas for saying them. Knowing that in advance--understanding that contradictory words will be greeted with personal attack and saying them anyway--requires the sort of courage Thomas was trying to advance that night and which surely he had to muster in order to make that speech.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he made clear without bellicosity, it takes courage to participate in active citizenship. It takes courage to face down jeering crowds because you invite debate. It takes courage not to be cowed into the silence of self-censorship when brutes resort to in- your-face intimidation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows this better than Thomas, a black man who managed to navigate two American cultures, both black and white, in his odyssey from Pin Point, Ga., to the U.S. Supreme Court. That sort of journey takes courage. And though Thomas never said so, it also takes guts, which this man has to spare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Parker is a syndicated columnist based in South Carolina.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1022742622.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Vision quest</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1933, four years after a calamitous market crash, Americans were losing hope. But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. \"They have no vision,\" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, \"and when there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. \"I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,\" he said. \"I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of \"job creators\" and eliminating \"red tape that's strangling business.\" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a \"grand bargain\" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of \"austerity\" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving \"welfare queens.\" This was a continuation of Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, \"the vision thing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\" His consulting firm, Westen Strategies, is not working for either candidate in this year's presidential race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:Danny Schwartz For The Times</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 12s "}}

The only question was, Why?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia, a self-described ''far right'' law professor at the University of Texas, was attending the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala at what could only be called a triumphal moment. The Federalist Society, a group of conservative lawyers and academics, has emerged from obscurity to become perhaps the most powerful force in the law today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over four days of panels and soirees, the Federalists were the toast of official Washington. Members of the Bush cabinet, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, joined in the festivities. And Justice Antonin Scalia mused to a packed banquet hall, ''Who would have thought 20 years ago that that little organization of students at a couple of law schools would have evolved today to a power of such proportions?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the legal panels, administration officials fell over themselves to say what the crowd wanted to hear. At a business-law panel, a top Justice Department lawyer talked about settling the Microsoft antitrust case, a move applauded by conservatives, who saw the suit as Clinton-era interference with the prerogatives of big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to Mr. Graglia, the administration's business-friendly line sounded like so much liberal claptrap. During the question period, he demanded to know why the administration was bothering to enforce antitrust laws at all. ''It really is time to be bold,'' he insisted. ''The boldest thing to do would be to repeal all the laws.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Graglia wasn't the only conservative who was suffering. A woman stood up to declare herself ''dissatisfied and frustrated'' because the panel had not attacked the states for suing tobacco companies. A law professor fulminated against state attorneys general, like Eliot Spitzer of New York, who, by crusading to clean up the Enrons and WorldComs of the world, have become self-appointed securities commissioners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I must admit that when I headed down to Washington last week, I was expecting to encounter a good deal of gloating. The last time I spent any time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where a claque of right-leaning law students used to hang out late into the evening, grumbling about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the New Deal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now this same crowd is setting the nation's legal policy and selecting its judges -- with a freer hand than ever since the Republicans retook the Senate. They are using their informal network to place conservative true believers in influential positions throughout the federal government, from Supreme Court clerkships to top agency posts. In fact, one of the late-night Harvard Law Review grumblers from way back when, Miguel Estrada, is now a Federalist Society favorite for the next vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the Federalists' remarkable good fortune, I had expected the banter to be heavy with congratulations and plans for the future. But much of the rumbling in the hallways was of grudges' being lovingly nursed and of potshots' being fired against liberal enemies long ago vanquished.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before one event, a graybeard in the audience tutored a wet-behind-the-ears Federalist on the horrors of Travelgate, in which the Clinton White House did -- well, nothing much, really. At the black-tie banquet, a satirical song took aim at ''Brennan, Marx and Lenin.'' William Brennan, the Supreme Court justice who was being gleefully branded a communist, died in 1997.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The search for fictive liberal enemies reached a loopy low on the convention's last day, when an archconservative federal appeals court judge, Laurence Silberman, accused William Rehnquist's archconservative Supreme Court of having a secret plan to declare the death penalty unconstitutional. In an opinion just last month, the court reiterated its view that capital punishment is constitutional even for 16-year-olds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the event that most captured the spirit of the week was Kenneth Starr's speech and his introduction by Barbara Comstock, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs. Between them, Ms. Comstock and Mr. Starr managed to rail against Bill Clinton, James Carville, Lanny Davis, James Jeffords, Alan Dershowitz, the Warren court, trial lawyers and Barbra Streisand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Starr was particularly exercised about liberals' being result-oriented, abandoning their principles to reach the outcomes they favor. But he would have made a more compelling case if he had not proceeded to abandon his -- and the Federalist Society's -- own oft-repeated commitment to judicial restraint to praise the Supreme Court for striking down the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act in a burst of conservative activism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was the take-away, as meeting planners like to say, from the Federalist Society's big convention? First, if these are the folks choosing federal judges for the Bush administration -- and they are -- Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans need to be vigilant about investigating nominees' backgrounds, and using the filibuster, to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts. Second, Democrats and moderate Republicans in both houses will need to stand up for mainstream principles that are now under assault, like antitrust law and health and safety regulations. And finally, a point of sportsmanship: the only thing less appealing than a sore loser is a sore winner.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 16s "}}
{"id": "test_question_neutral_testing_2", "displayed_text": "<p>Talking About Race in Akron</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid discussions about race are difficult even in intimate settings among well-acquainted people. For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 8s "}}

Al \"The Mushroom\" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,\" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm not with the city anymore,\" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means \"mushroom\" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a \"City Official A.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any opinions on it,\" Grzyb said. \"I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it. Thank you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,\" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know nothing about it, I tell you,\" Daley insisted. \"I know nothing about it, any other questions?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/418468478.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>TOLERANCE FOR UNEASY DISCUSSIONS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Blacks and Mexican-Americans are not academically competitive with whites in selective institutions,\" said law Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas at Austin recently. \"They have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement. Failure is not looked upon with disgrace.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talk about pushing buttons. Politicians who roam the halls of the nearby state Capitol went ballistic. \"This is not the kind of academic riffraff that our taxpayers should be supporting,\" argued an African-American state senator from Dallas. A Hispanic colleague of his wrote University of Texas Chancellor William Cunningham to argue that Graglia's remarks \"amount to cultural character assassination\" and should not \"be protected by academic freedom.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reactionary students who also value political correctness more than open debate called for Graglia's dismissal. And knees wobbling, even the law school faculty disassociated itself from their colleague's remarks. Some genuflected in the direction of free speech, to be sure, but the emphasis was on disagreeing with Graglia without actually pinpointing why.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein lies an important point: Today, Americans who are supposed to be the stewards of our political and academic traditions are still debating whether there should be free speech, rather than accepting that right as a given and using it as a tool for seriously addressing the major public policy questions of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In truth, Graglia's concern about the underachievement of minorities at \"selective institutions\" was not unfounded. Hispanics and blacks are not doing as well as mainstream students, a point made long ago by Hoover Institution senior fellow Thomas Sowell, who is black. Likewise, scholars have noted that certain Asian-American groups appear to have a culture that does produce high academic achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia has a right to oppose <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which was the real object of his opinions. But where he erred was in leaving room for the interpretation that minority underachievement is inescapable because minorities are by definition underachievers. Leaving aside the issue of tautologies, isn't it likely that disparate socioeconomic circumstances might be a relevant factor? Doesn't the disproportionate convergence of race and poverty have a bearing on minority achievement in America today? Isn't chronic low-skill immigration in states such as Texas to be considered as a factor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Graglia may wish to recall American history. During the third great wave of immigration to the United States earlier in this century, low-skill immigrants from places like rural Italy came in for an enormous amount of prejudice and discrimination because it was assumed that being poor and uneducated they could not improve themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time, however, a number of factors came together to catapult millions of Italian-Americans into the mainstream. They became mayors, governors, Cabinet members and federal judges. Is it just possible that Graglia might soften his views toward Hispanics against such a backdrop? Is it possible that he might consider that racism and other factors have played a disproportionate role in keeping blacks down?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was having lunch in Santa Monica, Calif., the other day after a panel discussion on immigration, race and education, when I heard an articulate person at my table say that bigots needed to be shown up for what they are, or else they may be taken seriously. There is some truth in that, but it also seems to me that people who can't identify a bigot on their own or who are prone to allege bigotry where none exists are nearly as dangerous as the bigot. That is precisely why the country is more in need of education through dialogue rather than exhortation, peroration or condemnation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all people, President Clinton needs to be reminded that such a dialogue must take in a variety of points of view. But on issues of race, don't look for nuance from Clinton. \"Those kinds of remarks don't go down well with the president, period,\" said White House press secretary Mike McCurry in condemning Graglia's opinions out of hand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Graglia hurt a lot of people's feelings in how he said what he said. In ignoring America's past and overlooking the redemptive promise this country has held out to groups that have triumphed over time after having started at the bottom, the truth about impoverished minorities and their potential has eluded him. Even so, he deserves tolerance from a society willing to engage in a complicated discussion where hurt feelings are inevitable.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 15m 41s "}}

One whose ranks and command structure are dominated by non-Hispanic whites? Or one whose makeup roughly reflects that of the entire city?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Richard Daley's administration has announced a strategy to achieve something close to the latter. For this he should be applauded. Instead, he is being lambasted, seemingly from every quarter--though mainly by factions placing their own self-interest above the common good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has said the next round of promotions to the rank of sergeant will not be based solely on the results of a written test. (The last time that was done, only five minorities placed among the 114 highest-scoring promotees.) Instead, 70 percent of next year's new sergeants will be chosen solely on test results, while another 30 percent will be selected on the basis of job performance. Presumably the latter will be chosen with an eye toward racial and ethnic balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police union bosses, apparently content to see a mostly white police force patrol a mostly black and Hispanic city, screamed immediately that Daley wants to bring back old-fashioned political cronyism to the promotion process. That's a cheap shot. It is also, however, fair warning to the mayor that the so-called \"merit\" promotees had better not be sponsored by his pals or by ward committeemen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaders of the African-American Police League, meanwhile, said they were \"insulted\" that the mayor thinks special measures are needed to qualify more black sergeants. They claim the written test--which deals mainly with laws and procedures a sergeant ought to know--is racially biased, even though expert after independent expert has said it is fair. (Perhaps the AAPL is unaware that there have been some problems here with the public schools.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, actual performance would be a welcome criterion even without the racial undertow. No written test can predict how effective an officer will be in defusing an ugly domestic dispute or differentiating at a glance between a drug lookout and somebody waiting for a bus. That requires common sense, compassion and knowledge of the community--none of which are ascertained best by multiple-choice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's uncertain whether Daley's plan will survive the inevitable judicial review. Appellate courts have been leaning against race-based admission and promotion systems, although a wise jurist ought to be able to differentiate between <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> quotas and a diverse city's need to develop an effective police force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley's solution isn't perfect. Job performance ought to figure into all promotions, not just 30 percent. And if this more subjective criterion is abused, as some predict, Chicagoans will know whom to blame. For now, the mayor's plan deserves support.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 20s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}

That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like \"violence never settles anything\" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word \"never.\" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, \"Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer.\" Goldberg responds, \"So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?\" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like \"Diversity is strength,\" either. (\"Cool,\" he writes. \"The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!\") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\" Sure, he writes, \"if the other man is an idiot.\" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"We don't solve problems by throwing money at them.\" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.\" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare.\" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left.\" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"America: Love It Or Leave It.\" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?\" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, \"Reality has a liberal bias.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/307918907.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>`Goals' vs. `Quotas' at The Post</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Washington Post recently has been in a tizzy. Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has produced \"racial strife.\" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging. Even apparently thriving ones conduct themselves as if bankruptcy is just around the corner, laying off employees, killing certain editions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of America is like that. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, conceived in an era when economic growth seemed an American birthright, has become a lot harder to sell in a time of economic insecurity. Under those circumstances, it gets a lot harder to accept a program whose central premise -- that race (or sex) ought to be taken into account in hiring or promotion -- runs counter to the American creed. What once seemed worth trying (despite some reservations) is now seen as downright threatening.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond what <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has come to mean to many whites, it is hardly an unalloyed boon to blacks. No doubt, it has done some good. When Colin Powell proclaims himself an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> baby, we are all obligated to pay attention to what he's saying. But attention also should be paid to the pained reaction of black journalists to the New Republic piece. Using unattributed quotes, it charged that some incompetent people had been hired simply on account of race. If such people exist, I don't know them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I admire what The Post is attempting -- and anyway, I can't imagine a newspaper without a diversified staff. I know the paper's managers and their deep commitment to racial justice -- to whites as well as nonwhites. But this utilization of ethnic, racial and sexual categories in hiring inevitably sets one group against another. The standard for success is not in reaching a certain percentage but in turning out a better newspaper. Numerical goals, while understandable, ought to be replaced by only one: absolute nondiscrimination.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
