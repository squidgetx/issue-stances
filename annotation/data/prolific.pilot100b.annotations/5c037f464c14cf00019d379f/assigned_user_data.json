Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was \"a little taken aback\" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. \"You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,\" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, \"MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,\" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as \"enormously secretive and powerful\" and \"a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected.

Baker III, a Maryland state legislator from Cheverly in Prince George's County, was \"a little taken aback\" when a former ambassador and a deputy assistant secretary of state showed up in Annapolis to lobby him last week. Their mission: to block a Baker proposal to impose sanctions against companies that do business in Nigeria, a wanton human-rights abuser in Africa.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State Department officials, like those from the U.S. Trade Representative's office, increasingly are finding that they have to negotiate with Americans as well as their foreign counterparts. From Massachusetts to California to New York City, local initiative and foreign policy are coming into conflict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is America's thickening connections with the world. \"You have to go back to George Washington's day to find a time when the United States was as dependent on foreign trade and investment as it is today,\" says Alan Larson, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs and the boss of last week's emissaries to Annapolis. In 1970 imports and exports were equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product; today they're up to 30 percent. U.S. investments overseas, and foreign investments here, also have soared.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's not just a question of volume. As ties grow, the United States increasingly is trying to shape other countries' societies. Trade talks used to focus on tariffs, duties, anti-dumping provisions and other matters that only trade lawyers understood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. officials focus on what they call \"non-tariff barriers\": corruption, inadequate antitrust law, even zoning-like regulations that may work against U.S. products. In Europe, the United States is fighting health laws that keep out U.S. beef. In Japan, the United States attacks laws that help preserve neighborhoods by shielding small shops from competition -- but also make life difficult for U.S. exporters. U.S. labor unions want the administration to pressure other nations to allow collective bargaining.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, other nations don't always welcome these initiatives. Even less surprisingly, they have their own ideas about how the United States should organize itself. To win the right to challenge foreign barriers before international judges, America has had to subject itself to the same rules. Baker says he modeled his anti-Nigeria law on state laws that helped bring down apartheid in South Africa. But in the intervening years, the United States has signed on to treaties that preclude such laws -- and that give other nations the right to demand compensation from Washington if their firms are barred in Maryland.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no question, the State Department's Larson says, that the stuff of international negotiation today tends tend to \"get into your living room\" more than in the past. He should know; he's point man for a treaty-in-progress known as the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. Under negotiation for 2 1/2 years, this far-reaching pact would in most cases bind nations to treat foreign companies as they do their own, so that firms can invest across borders without fear of expropriation or unfair favoritism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The MAI hasn't yet attracted much attention in Washington. But it's the object of fevered opposition on talk radio and in some corners of the Internet. In the preface to a recently published tract, \"MAI and the Threat to American Freedom,\" Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader describe the proposed treaty as \"enormously secretive and powerful\" and \"a slow-motion coup d'etat against democratic governance in the United States, Canada and abroad. . . . \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to being secretive, the entire soporific text is available on the Web site of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place (www.oecd.org). But opponents are more persuasive when they list decisions they say could be taken out of Americans' hands. Since MAI would forbid countries from demanding a certain level of investment, wouldn't the Community Reinvestment Act -- which says banks must invest in low-income neighborhoods -- be thrown out? Since the treaty bans anything \"tantamount\" to expropriation, couldn't a foreign tobacco company challenge advertising restrictions that reduce the value of its investment? What about state laws that limit hunting licenses or farmland ownership to locals, minority contractor set-asides, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, right-to-work laws?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials say none of these would be affected. Government procurement would be exempted, all state and local laws would be grandfathered, the \"tantamount\" language would be amended to underscore the inviolability of legitimate health, environmental and safety regulation. Moreover, they argue that MAI would help American workers, because U.S. firms in today's economy need to operate effectively abroad to remain healthy at home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Clinton administration, still smarting from the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, isn't pushing MAI too hard.

Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test.

It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system.

But the leaker didn\u2019t know, or wouldn\u2019t say, which way the case came out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Dreamers and their supporters, hearts would have been in their throats. This was the chief justice, after all, who two years ago wrote the opinion upholding President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban, and who five years before that wrote the opinion dismantling the Voting Rights Act. The vote in both was 5 to 4. Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Why wouldn\u2019t the conservative chief justice defer to the president\u2019s decision to end a program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that his predecessor had instituted by executive action without even seeking Congress\u2019s approval?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president\u2019s allies would have had ample reason to be anxious. Wasn\u2019t this the chief justice who just a year ago wrote the majority opinion that by a vote of 5 to 4 blocked the president\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census? The proposal failed the essential requirement of administrative law for \u201creasoned decision making,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote in that case. He dismissed the administration\u2019s proffered good-government rationale as pretextual; or, as the dictionary puts it, \u201cdubious or spurious.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, of course, we know that it was the Chief Justice Roberts of the census decision, which an enraged President Trump came within inches of defying, who arrived on the scene in time to save the Dreamers. His opinion assured readers that in holding that the administration\u2019s effort to undo DACA was invalid, the court was not endorsing the program. That is conventional administrative law talk \u2014 and the case, as the chief justice framed it, was a conventional one about administrative procedure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration\u2019s explanation for why it was terminating DACA \u2014 explained in a single sentence by an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated\u201d) \u2014 was so inadequate as to make the decision \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the department came up with a more elaborate explanation nine months later in response to an unfavorable Federal District Court ruling, the chief justice said that it was a \u201cfoundational principle of administrative law\u201d that an agency, once challenged, has to defend its action on the grounds it initially invoked, not on an after-the-fact rationalization, unless it wants to restart from scratch the process of arriving at a decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dry procedural language of the opinion, including its invitation to the Trump administration to start over and find a new way to defend terminating DACA, seems to have lulled many readers into assuming that the victory for the Dreamers is less than complete. No doubt many eyes had glazed over by Page 24, when the chief justice began a crucial discussion of the \u201creliance interests\u201d in favor of continuing the program that permits DACA recipients to live and work lawfully in the only country that most of them have ever known.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Citing statistics in briefs filed by, among others, a group of 143 businesses, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that those with a stake in continuing the program included not only the Dreamers themselves but also their families, \u201cincluding their 200,000 U.S.-citizen children,\u201d \u201cemployers who have invested time and money in training them\u201d and state and local governments that would lose tax revenue from DACA recipients\u2019 earnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Administrative law requires the agency to take reliance interests into account, Chief Justice Roberts said. \u201cDHS may determine, in the particular context before it, that other interests and policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMaking that difficult decision was the agency\u2019s job, but the agency failed to do it.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And can the Trump administration do it now? Theoretically yes, under still another acting homeland security secretary, but any newly justified rescission announcement would find the administration back in court within hours, the clock ticking all the while toward Election Day. Although the chief justice nominally left it up to the administration to weigh the reliance interests against its policy goal, his exposition of the strength of those interests sets a very high bar for this or any subsequent administration to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where was the other Chief Justice Roberts this week, the one of the disastrous Shelby County v. Holder voting rights decision and of the travel ban decision? Was the Chief Justice Roberts who silently joined Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion bringing L.G.B.T.Q. people within the protection of federal anti-discrimination law the same chief justice who wrote a snarky dissenting opinion five years ago when the court upheld the constitutional right to same-sex marriage?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contemplating this head-snapping week at the Supreme Court, I\u2019m reminded of the amazing 2002-2003 term, when the court under another conservative chief justice, William Rehnquist, seemed to pull its robust conservatism up short. In the space of a few weeks in the spring of 2003, the court upheld <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in higher education; granted constitutional protection to gay men and lesbians for their private sexual lives; and upheld the application of the family-care provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act to state employees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Rehnquist himself was in dissent in the first two of those cases, but he surprised nearly everyone by writing the majority opinion in the third, a case that may sound obscure now but that effectively spelled an end to the federalism revolution on which, under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, the court had been embarked.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could have accounted for that surprising turn of events at the dawn of the new century? Wrestling with that question, I eventually concluded that the court was realigning itself, as it has done historically, with its own sense of what the public wanted and expected from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cNo great Supreme Court case is only a question of law,\u201d I wrote then. \u201cIt is always also an episode in the ongoing dialogue by which the court engages with the society in which it operates and in which the justices live.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just so with this week\u2019s cases. Monday\u2019s ruling on the right of gay and transgender people to be free of discrimination in the workplace showed a court that by a refreshing vote of 6 to 3 decided not to stand in the path of a tide of social change. The DACA decision contained a message threaded through its dry language of administrative procedure \u2014 a warning to the Trump administration not to assume that it gets a free pass, not to take the Supreme Court for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThis is not the case for cutting corners,\u201d the chief justice wrote. That\u2019s a sentence sure to be echoing in the halls of the solicitor general\u2019s office, where Chief Justice Roberts once worked and where he honed his ability to speak to the Supreme Court. Now, with four colleagues to his left and four to his right, he speaks for the court from a center chair that must often feel like a lonely place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the decisions due in the next few weeks on abortion, religion, the president\u2019s tax returns and the Electoral College, among other cases, it\u2019s too soon to place a label on this pandemic-disrupted Supreme Court term. The justices will issue decisions that will infuriate, reassure, surprise and even break hearts, as they evidently broke Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s on Monday. The Missouri Republican took to the Senate floor to bemoan \u201cthe end of the conservative legal movement.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as the ambitious young senator, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Roberts, surely knows, there is no end, only a new beginning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
