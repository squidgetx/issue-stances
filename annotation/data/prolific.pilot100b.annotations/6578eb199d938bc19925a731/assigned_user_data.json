Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling.

And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,\" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. \"You don't know anything, do you?\" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore.

Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,\" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. \"Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' \" he recalled. \" 'How do you think you can make it there?' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs. \"The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' \" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of \"The Big Test,\" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people \"more like us\" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. \"It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't.

Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,\" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. \"Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' \" he recalled. \" 'How do you think you can make it there?' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs. \"The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' \" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of \"The Big Test,\" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people \"more like us\" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. \"It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student.

And as news it's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the under-representation of women in math and the sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, what happened at Purdue is a pungent reminder of all that's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses -- and in this presidential election year, not perhaps only on our campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story began prosaically enough. Keith Sampson, a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree, was in the habit of reading during work breaks. Last October he was immersed in \"Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative, who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room, and that he could be fired. Taking the book to the campus, Mr. Sampson says he was told, was \"like bringing pornography to work.\" That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The assistant <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed. Indeed she was, Mr. Sampson says, irate at his explanation that he was, after all, reading a scholarly book. \"The Klan still rules Indiana,\" Marguerite Watkins told him -- didn't he know that? Mr. Sampson, by now dazed, pointed out that this book was carried in the university library. Yes, she retorted, you can get Klan propaganda in the library.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The university has allowed no interviews with Ms. Watkins or any other university official involved in the case. Still, there can be no disputing the contents of the official letter that set forth the university's case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sampson stood accused of \"openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your Black co-workers.\" The statement, signed by chief <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Lillian Charleston, asserted that her office had completed its investigation of the charges brought by Ms. Nakea William, his co- worker -- that Mr. Sampson had continued, despite complaints, to read a book on this \"inflammatory topic.\" \"We conclude,\" the letter informed him, \"that your conduct constitutes racial harassment. . . .\" A very serious matter, with serious consequences, it went on to point out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was in November. Months later, in February of this year, Mr. Sampson received -- from the same source -- a letter with an astonishingly transformed version of his offense. And there could be no mystery as to the cause of this change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the official judgment against him, Mr. Sampson turned to Indiana state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose office contacted university attorneys. Worse, the case got some sharp local press coverage that threatened to get wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ludicrous harassment cases are not rare at our institutions of higher learning. But there was undeniably something special -- something pure, and glorious -- in the clarity of this picture. A university had brought a case against a student on grounds of a book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so the new letter to Mr. Sampson by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer Charleston brought word that she wished to clarify her previous letter, and to say it was \"permissible for him to read scholarly books or other materials on break time.\" About the essential and only theme of the first letter -- the \"racially abhorrent\" subject of the book -- or the warnings that any \"future substantiated conduct of a similar nature could mean serious disciplinary action\" -- there was not a word. She had meant in that first letter, she said, only to address \"conduct\" that caused concern among his co-workers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What that conduct was, the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> officer did not reveal -- but she had delivered the message rewriting the history of the case. Absolutely and for certain there had been no problem about any book he had been reading.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This, indeed, was now the official story -- as any journalist asking about the case would learn instantly from the university's media relations representatives. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved -- if not much -- by the extraordinary efforts of these tormented agents trying to explain that the first letter was all wrong: No reading of any book had anything to do with the charges against Mr. Sampson. This means, I asked one, that Mr. Sampson could have been reading about the adventures of Jack and Jill and he still would have been charged? Yes. What, then, was the offense? \"Harassing behavior.\" While reading the book? The question led to careful explanations hopeless in tone -- for good reason -- and well removed from all semblance of reason. What the behavior was, one learned, could never be revealed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was, of course, no other offensive behavior; had there been any it would surely have appeared in the first letter's gusher of accusation. Like those prosecutors who invent new charges when the first ones fail in court, the administrators threw in the mysterious harassment count. Such were the operations of the university's guardians of equity and justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In April -- having been pressed by the potent national watchdog group FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) as well as the ACLU -- University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz finally sent them a letter expressing regret over this affair, and testifying to his profound commitment to freedom of expression. So far as can be ascertained, the university has extended no such expressions of regret to Keith Sampson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This case and all its kind are worth bearing in mind for anyone pondering the hypersensitivity surrounding the issue of race today. The mindset that produces those harassment courts, those super-heated capacities for perceiving insult, is not limited to college campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its presence is evident in this election campaign, which has seen more than a touch of readiness to impute some form of racism to all tough criticisms of Barack Obama. The deranged response that greeted Bill Clinton's remark that certain of Sen. Obama's claims were \"a fairy tale,\" told the story. No need to go into the now famous catalogue of accusations about the Clintons' \"sly racist\" tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There will be much more ahead, directed to the Republicans and their candidate. Some more, no doubt, about the Willie Horton ad of 1988, whose status as a quintessential piece of racism is -- except for a few rare voices of reason -- accepted throughout our media as revealed truth. To be sure, the Willie Horton charge has for some time been over-shadowed by ominous predictions of all the Swiftboating Republicans are supposed to be readying.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Mr. Obama himself, the candidate of racial transcendence, has now taken a plunge of sorts to old-style race politics. In a preemptive dismissal of future criticism, he warned a Florida audience on June 20, of the racist tactics the Republicans planned. \"We know the strategy,\" he said. Republicans planned to make people afraid of him. They'd say \"he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this may be far from the world of the universities. But to those aforementioned campus ideologues, the thinking is familiar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yesterday's op-ed article by Dorothy Rabinowitz, \"American Politics Aren't 'Post-Racial',\" misstated the name of the university.

The experiences he recounted were \"a source of amazement and inspiration,\" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him \"but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us.\" She said she found herself \"hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.\"I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. \"This is a case about federalism,\" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. \"Jackson should be asked about her views on race,\" the statement said, adding that \"at a time when a major <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.\"Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

The experiences he recounted were \"a source of amazement and inspiration,\" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him \"but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us.\" She said she found herself \"hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.\"I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. \"This is a case about federalism,\" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown.

So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to win,\" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Doesn't matter if it's the next race,\" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. \"But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I was able to trick him,\" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, \"into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I apologize for that,\" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. \"But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to win,\" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Doesn't matter if it's the next race,\" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. \"But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I was able to trick him,\" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, \"into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I apologize for that,\" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. \"But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

He suggests that no other president has shown such generosity to a group of people as helpless as we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I now know the cause of my indignation. Trump sounds like a slave master proclaiming that he is good to his Negroes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To keep their slaves submissive, the masters would threaten to sell them to less compassionate owners if they got out of line. \"I have done more for the Black community\" sounds like a slave owner claiming that he's a good master because he doesn't beat his slaves as often or cut off their feet to stop them from fleeing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a racist, self-gratifying pronouncement that was passed down through generations of prominent white people who held power over African Americans. It was prevalent in the South during the 1960s, when Black women largely were domestic workers cleaning homes and caring for the children of white employers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not uncommon for a white woman to brag to her friends about how good she was to her help. Though she paid wages too small to live on, she rewarded her \"girl\" with items from her home -- discarded furniture, clothing and trinkets that Black people struggling to put food on the table would never buy for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wants us to understand that even the first Black president, Barack Obama, couldn't fix our problems.

He sees African Americans as violently barbaric people and describes our neighborhoods as \"living in hell.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has written us off as too dumb to understand how we have created these conditions ourselves. And he is losing patience with us because we refuse to acknowledge all that he does for us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed it more bluntly. Appearing Monday on \"Fox & Friends,\" Kushner brought up the old racist adage that Black people can't succeed to the heights of white people because they don't want to be successful.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"One thing we've seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump's policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they're complaining about,\" said Kushner, a top White House adviser. \"But he can't want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kushner went on to suggest that African Americans would rather complain than do what is necessary to improve their lives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the white savior in the Oval Office has broken his back trying to help Black people, while we are being lazy and shiftless. This came from someone who came up in his father's business and is only in his prominent position because he is married to the president's daughter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisy of both Kushner and Trump, who inherited wealth from his father, is astounding. It shows complete ignorance when it comes to the interplay between race and economics in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It overlooks the impressive achievements of large numbers of African Americans in spite of a system that historically has offered little or no assistance. It also ignores that this same system has successfully fought to tear down equalizers such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> that sought to provide a bridge to economic parity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking at Stanford University in 2017, Harvard University sociologist William Julius Wilson pointed out that the income of more affluent African Americans was increasing prior to Trump taking office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When adjusted for inflation, the percentage of African Americans earning at least $75,000 more than doubled to 21% from 1970 to 2014, he said.

In contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26%, he added.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means does that indicate that African Americans have reached economic parity in this county.
