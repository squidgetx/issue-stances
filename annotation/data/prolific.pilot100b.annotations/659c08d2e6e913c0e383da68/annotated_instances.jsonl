It's an experiment providing a \"universal basic income,\" or UBI, to low-income Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In conjunction with the Marin Community Foundation, which plans to contribute $3 million to the effort, the Marin County Board of Supervisors has allocated $400,000 in public funds for the experiment. The program is similar to one recently completed in Stockton, Calif., but one major difference sets the Marin experiment apart: race and sex discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Stockton UBI experiment provided payments to 125 residents of neighborhoods at or below Stockton's median household income. The Marin regime will do the same, but beneficiaries must be \"mothers of color.\" That term is undefined, but it's clear that fathers and white mothers are ineligible to participate. A similar race-based scheme has been announced in Oakland, Calif.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter what one thinks of UBI as a policy matter, the use of public funds in the Marin scheme is legally dubious. The California Constitution's equal-protection clause, like the federal one in the 14th Amendment, applies \"strict scrutiny\"\u2014the highest possible level of judicial scrutiny\u2014to racial classifications. California courts, unlike federal ones, also apply strict scrutiny to sex classifications. In Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001), a California appeals court made that clear in invalidating both race- and sex-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If I had grown up in Marin County under its proposed UBI regime, my family would have been ineligible to participate. I grew up poor and at times homeless or living in public housing projects. But my mother, who is white, was raising her three black children on her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin Community Foundation's chief executive, Thomas Peters, has said that \"this first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color\" because they face \"the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My mother was low-income, had three young children and faced racial discrimination. We lived in black communities where black men were stigmatized for consorting with white women, and that stigma flowed to those women and their biracial children.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If my mother was somehow privileged over similarly situated black mothers, it could only have been by the slimmest possible margin. To exclude someone like her from a public-assistance program on account of her skin color is the very definition of racial injustice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Marin UBI scheme threatens to drive the wedge of racial discord currently tearing wildly through our social fabric even deeper. And frankly, policies with good intentions such as UBI, which might conceivably help to address the intractable problem of poverty, will be tainted with the scarlet R of racism and the understandable suspicion of being a pretense for reparative racial justice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Westhill is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Marin County's Discriminatory 'Universal Basic Income'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Devon Westhill</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 14s "}}

{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421978637.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Rehnquist's Mixed Legacy</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sixteen men have served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting \"subversive activities\" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most \"activist\" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}

Unfamiliar with the surroundings in the dark, he bonks his head on the refrigerator and is out cold for three and a half years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he opens his eyes in 1992, refreshed after his long rest, he sees the face of White House chief of staff John Sununu peering down at him. Mr. Bush's first words are ''How fares the nation?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Everything is in great shape,'' Mr. Sununu reports. ''Peace, prosperity without inflation, the kinder-gentler thing doing fine. One of Millie's grandpuppies just had her first litter, and the Post Office is delivering the announcement cards.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President warily asks for specifics: ''How much does it cost to mail a letter from Washington to California?''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Same as last year,'' shrugs Sununu, ''300 yen.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To discover if such complacency is rampant at the center of power, and to track down the source of a troubling new phrase, I visited Governor Sununu in his West Wing office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is, as they say, sharp. When I recalled hours spent in that corner office with a previous occupant, and added wistfully, ''Say what you like about Haldeman, nobody ever ran into his motorcades,'' Mr. Sununu smiled and replied, ''I'll mention that to Cheney.'' He had caught the obscure allusion to inept Presidential motorcading during the Ford Administration when Dick Cheney was chief of staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, he is still insecure and wet behind his White House ears. In our interview, which was on foreground, he had his deputy sit in to take notes, sign of a player new to the big leagues and fearful of being misquoted. He had his secretary rush in with a message about being late for a meeting with the President, which he waved off to flatter his visitor but also to impress him with the value of the time being taken up. That hoary heave-ho technique is known to Oval Officiators as ''the 10-minute bounce.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about the perception of leisureliness in governance, the near-palindromic aide offered a fresh metaphor to explain the failure to understand the Bush approach: ''Ours is a different template.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Translation: You can no longer use the Reagan template on the keyboard of power. (A template in this sense is a plastic instruction sheet cut out to overlay the computer's keys.) The Bush template reflects a different processing system: if you hold down Alt and push F9, you will now get conciliation where you used to get confrontation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I take this to mean, for example, that the deal made with Speaker Wright to keep the contras fed while giving a policy veto on Nicaragua to Congress would be an unprincipled cave-in on the Reagan template, but is a net pragmatic gain on the Bush template.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief of staff ''had a little chat with'' Boyden Gray about the way the President's counsel, shut out of that Baker-Sununu-Scowcroft project, objected publicly. I think Mr. Gray was right in trying to stop an evisceration of Presidential power, but Mr. Sununu disagrees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was not trapped by what was artfully presented as a linguistic question. The phrase enhanced rescission is being whispered in the corridors of power. Sounds like a tricky euphemism; what does it mean?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''It's an alternative to the line-item veto,'' he said, suggesting Bob Dole as the best source about that, I presume to avoid letting it appear to be an executive initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power to impound - to not spend - funds appropriated by Congress was taken away from a weakened President in 1974; Mr. Reagan's counterattack, the line-item veto, never had a chance of passage. That leaves a middle ground of ''rescission,'' or getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations, to be ''enhanced'' by making unnecessary the current affirmative legislative action.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The upshot would be a substantial giveback of executive authority, as evidence that the Tower appointment precedent and the contra-veto usurpation were not waves of the future. It would show, too, that the Bush White House was effectively at work behind the scenes, progressing without grandstanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will Mr. Sununu and budgeteer Dick Darman win this for President Bush? I don't see how, if their standard becomes a white feather on a flapping doormat, but for my different template, I am willing to plunk down about 300 yen.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 49s "}}

An F1 career blasts off</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lewis Hamilton is more than just Formula One's first black driver. We could be witnessing the arrival of a Tiger Woods on wheels.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton, 22, is off to the best start ever for an F1 rookie-- ever!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And at the highest level of automobile racing in the world, he's in some serious historical company: Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Jackie Stewart, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jimmy Clark . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His breakthrough victory could come as soon as Sunday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>F1 is abuzz with the numerology of Hamilton's onslaught: third in the season-opening Grand Prix of Australia, second last Sunday in Malaysia, so why not first in Bahrain this weekend?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he wins may be a matter of when his McLaren-Mercedes team gives him the green light to go all out. So far he has been following F1 protocol for a junior driver, which is to defer to the senior teammate--in this case Fernando Alonso, who at 25 has won world championships the last two years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You have to understand the subtleties of F1 to get the entire meaning of what Hamilton said to his team via radio last Sunday, seconds after completing one of the most captivating second-place drives by anyone, rookie or not, in memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The radio transmission was uplinked to the world by satellite TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I want to win,\" Hamilton said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, of course he does. But you could read that not as a simple expression of ambition, but as a request to McLaren team boss Ron Dennis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Doesn't matter if it's the next race,\" Hamilton continued in the accent of his birthplace, England. \"But sometime this year, I'm going to have one.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Hamilton's Malaysian drive:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He started fourth, but quickly, artfully, slipped past both Ferraris--better, quicker cars than his McLaren--into second place, falling in behind teammate Alonso, who had jumped from second into the lead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From there, Hamilton's job was not to challenge Alonso, but to fight a defensive action to hold off the favored Ferraris so Alonso could get away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Hamilton did, all race, in electrifying ways at times.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Felipe Massa--whom Ferrari deems its rising star--tried three times to get around Hamilton. Three times Hamilton darted back ahead, making Massa look worse each time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I was able to trick him,\" Hamilton said afterward in an uplinked news conference, \"into out-braking himself, to the point that he went off [into the grass, on the third try].</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I apologize for that,\" Hamilton said, and then smiled with polite ruthlessness. \"But we have the points, so it doesn't really matter.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With 14 season points, Hamilton is third in the world championship standings, only four behind leader Alonso. That's the highest standing ever for a rookie at this point in a season. Only one other driver, Peter Arundel in 1964, scored podium finishes in his first two starts--a pair of thirds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later in the Malaysian race Hamilton held off Kimi Raikkonen, widely considered the quickest driver in the world now that Schumacher has retired, in the other Ferrari. Alonso won easily because Hamilton fought the war. That's how it works in F1. But Hamilton was more impressive than his world-champion teammate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is but a touch of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in Hamilton's story-- just enough to be fair in the unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing. He has taken it from there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His father, Anthony Hamilton, born in England to immigrants from Grenada, bought Lewis a go-kart when he was 8. The youngster was so good that by age 13 he was signed to a developmental contract by McLaren's Dennis and Mercedes-Benz racing director Norbert Haug.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By 2005, Hamilton was making Dennis and Haug look prescient, dominating the F3 Euroseries with 15 victories and 13 poles. Then last year he soared through the GP2 series, the final stepping stone to F1, winning the championship on his first try.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Hamilton still might be waiting in the pipeline of the McLaren-Mercedes system if not for an ironic twist to what NASCAR considered its greatest coup yet toward driver diversity: the defection of Colombian star Juan Pablo Montoya from F1.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most monumental aspect of Montoya's move may turn out to be that it left a seat open at McLaren: the one Hamilton has filled so dazzlingly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ehinton@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Lewis Hamilton gleefully displays his second-place trophy in Malaysia last Sunday.

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: \"I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do.\" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: \"If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered \"out of a multitude of tongues.\" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its \"uncomfortable learning\" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

The 1957 attempt by the Arkansas governor Orval Faubus to block Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School led to threats of violence against the federal judge who enforced the court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. That judge, Ronald N. Davies, was \u201cuncowed,\u201d the chief justice wrote, despite being \u201cphysically threatened.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cA judicial system cannot and should not live in fear,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts added as he thanked Congress for passing a law last year to protect judges. The new law was named in honor of Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, who was murdered in 2020 in an assault meant for the judge at her home. The law screens from the public the personal information of federal judges and their families, including identifiers such as license plate numbers and addresses. Leaders like the chief justice deserve praise when they highlight the dangers all public officials now face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Focusing on the Brown decision was nonetheless surprising. After all, the court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in school admissions, one of the very remedies that the Brown decision spawned, and which all nine members of the court stood squarely behind in 1954 and reaffirmed in a subsequent case in 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In past years, the chief justice sometimes used his year-end report to describe substantive reforms in the federal courts, like the task force created in 2018 in response to allegations that federal judges had harassed their staffs sexually and in other ways. Not so in his latest report, which was four pages long with a five-page appendix. Chief Justice Roberts did not mention any of the many issues that made the news about the court last year \u2014 the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices whose actions or those of family members raise questions about impartiality, the leak of a draft of the court\u2019s decision overturning abortion rights, the insufficiency of financial disclosure and questions about fund-raising for the Supreme Court Historical Society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor did the chief justice explore the troubling data in his report\u2019s appendix on \u201cthe workload of the courts.\u201d The numbers document a sharp decline of the use of the federal courts. Federal appellate filings fell again in the fiscal year 2022, a steady decline from 49,000 in 2018 to fewer than 42,000 last year. Trial-level civil cases in the federal district courts have fallen precipitously as well \u2014 down from more almost 283,000 cases in 2018 to about 240,000 in 2022.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In calculating totals and the trend in civil cases, court administrators did not include about 321,000 filings that, starting in 2020, were brought by military service members and veterans who claimed that combat earplugs sold by 3M to the U.S. military were faulty. Under a federal statute, those cases became, in effect, one litigation, consolidated before trial in front of a single judge, and they are an example of the importance of people having access to courts, which can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opinions of the very court that the chief justice leads provide insight into the decline. We know from our own experience that savvy civil rights lawyers now steer clear of federal court. Winning in the appellate courts risks having the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority extinguish any gains won for women, prisoners, the environment and more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dwindling numbers of filings at the trial level in the U.S. District Courts also derive in part from what the Supreme Court has done during the last few decades \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants, in class-action lawsuits and other cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key example can be found in the court\u2019s interpretations of the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In a series of cases that began in the 1980s, the court has read the statute to mean that employers and businesses can include arbitration clauses in lengthy, dense, fine-print documents with consumers and employees that bar access to courts and to class actions. Even complaints of violations of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and of federal laws regulating securities, fair credit, unlawful mergers and unfair business practices can be forced into arbitration rather than being litigated in court. Anyone aggrieved has to go, one by one, to private arbitration. In practice, almost none do, because most people don\u2019t have the resources to pursue small-value claims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, the veterans in the combat earplug cases were able to get into court because no arbitration mandate kept them out. And once in court, because of procedures designed to make group-based litigation easier, they could combine resources to pursue their arguments of hearing loss and tinnitus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201cstate of the judiciary\u201d address is a bully pulpit constructed decades ago by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Given the challenges the country faces, we need a chief justice who helps us all talk seriously about what ails the federal courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s focus on 1950s desegregation litigation is a poignant reminder that once federal courts led the way in protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all. His court, however, has made plain it has no interest in opening doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For that, we need Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the power of would-be defendants to control access. That\u2019s what Congress did in 2022 when it amended the 1925 arbitration statute to let victims of sexual assault and harassment decide if they want to sue in court rather than consider using arbitration. The chief justice properly commended Congress for making strides in protecting federal judges. Now Congress needs to protect and support the right to bring cases to those judges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nancy Gertner, a retired Federal District Court judge, is a senior lecturer in law at Harvard Law School.

The experiences he recounted were \"a source of amazement and inspiration,\" she wrote, not only for what they revealed about him \"but also because of what they instill in, and ask, of us.\" She said she found herself \"hoping to hear, just once more, another story that would, by and by, perhaps change the way I see the world.\"I was touched by the essay when I first read it, but also puzzled. If I had been asked to name justices who were immune to Thurgood Marshall's influence, Justice O'Connor, who had been on the court for 11 years and had served with him for 10 years, would have been on the list. She opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and her states'-rights orientation made her antagonistic to federal court review of state criminal justice issues. I was taken aback by her first line in a 1991 majority opinion that rejected an appeal from an inmate on Virginia's death row. \"This is a case about federalism,\" she declared. Justice Marshall dissented.And yet. By the time of her own retirement in 2006, Justice O'Connor was in a very different place. She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. \"Jackson should be asked about her views on race,\" the statement said, adding that \"at a time when a major <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.\"Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

She wrote the majority opinion that preserved <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions. She modulated her views on federalism. It would be ridiculous to ascribe Justice O'Connor's migration in late middle age solely to the influence of Justice Marshall, who died in 1993. But it would be equally ridiculous to discount his influence entirely. Why not take her at her word? She must have sensed something in 1992, a pull in a different direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Could President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, assuming her confirmation, inspire any of her new colleagues to see the world in a different way?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There doesn't seem to be a Sandra Day O'Connor lurking within today's carefully constructed conservative supermajority, and the heroic trajectory of Thurgood Marshall's life is not Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's story. It's fair to say that she has more in common with the justice she has been named to replace. Like Stephen Breyer, she was a star student at an excellent public high school. Her father, like his, worked as a lawyer for a big-city school board (Miami in her case, San Francisco in his). Success at Harvard Law School propelled them both to a Supreme Court clerkship (in fact, she clerked for him). Justice Breyer is often referred to as the father of the federal sentencing guidelines and served on the original United States Sentencing Commission, where she later served as vice chair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In drawing these parallels, I have deliberately not emphasized race. Yes, her nomination fulfills the president's campaign promise to appoint a Black woman, the first to sit on the Supreme Court. While that's cause for celebration, it shouldn't obscure the other kinds of diversity she would bring to the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity has many dimensions, perspective among them. That she would be the first former public defender to sit on the court has received wide notice, less so the fact that as a public school graduate she would be a rarity among the justices. Justice Breyer's departure will leave only two, Elena Kagan, who attended the highly selective Hunter College High School in Manhattan, hardly a typical public school, and Samuel Alito, who went to Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., near Trenton, his hometown. Every other member of the court is a graduate of a Catholic high school, a striking but little-observed fact at a time when cases concerning public and religious schools and the relationship between the two are prominent on the court's docket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Breyer's wife, Joanna, is a clinical psychologist who during her active career specialized in working with children being treated for cancer at the Lahey Clinic in Boston. Does having a medical professional in the family account for Justice Breyer's emphasis on facts and evidence in his opinions on medical subjects? With medical questions hardly about to disappear from the court's docket, it's worth noting that Judge Jackson's husband, Patrick, is a surgeon. (Justice Sonia Sotomayor's brother, Juan, is a doctor with an allergy practice in upstate New York.) Some conservative justices seem to assume that doctors don't act in the interest of their patients, whether performing abortions or administering vaccines. Maybe Judge Jackson will be able to persuade them otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or maybe not, but my point is that we cheat ourselves out of a full appreciation of what a person brings to the court if race is our only focus. On the day of Judge Jackson's nomination, Curt Levey, president of the right-wing interest group Committee for Justice, put out a statement that was as preposterous as it was predictable. \"Jackson should be asked about her views on race,\" the statement said, adding that \"at a time when a major <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case is on the Supreme Court's docket and our nation is debating whether equality or equity should be the governing anti-discrimination standard, we hope that senators will ask Judge Jackson about her views on equity, racial preferences, disparate impact and the like.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe it's only white nominees who are not expected to answer questions about pending cases. Maybe I missed other news releases from the Committee for Justice, but I don't remember Mr. Levey asking senators to drill down on the views on racial issues held by President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Don't white Supreme Court nominees also have a race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thurgood Marshall, born into segregation in 1908, was already a Supreme Court justice when Ketanji Brown was born 62 years later. She will walk through the doors that he opened. But her life story is not without power. She thrived at an integrated high school -- most public schools in the United States remain racially segregated -- where she was class president and a star debater, despite the lowered expectations that white administrators had for her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her parents attended historically Black colleges, building a solid middle-class life for their children's future. Her teenage dream was to be a judge. By 2012, when the country had a president determined to diversify the federal courts, Judge Jackson had walked through every open door and was ready for Barack Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a quintessentially American success story. Thinking about what her role on the court might be, is it fanciful to suppose that some of her colleagues, age mates who checked the same boxes on their way to the top, might look at Ketanji Brown Jackson and see themselves? Perhaps in the very familiarity of her path to the Supreme Court -- a story that to others might look extraordinary -- might lie its ability to inspire, or at least to prompt conservatives who are sure of what they think to think again. No, I don't expect her to change the court. But she may well change the conversation, and that's a start.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.
