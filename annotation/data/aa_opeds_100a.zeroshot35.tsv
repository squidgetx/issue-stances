1	favor	"The first text argues in favor of affirmative action, stating that there is evidence against the ""mismatch"" theory and that attending a more selective university can benefit minority students.

The second text also supports affirmative action, arguing that it is necessary to address the disparities in access to power and influence caused by unequal education opportunities.

The third text is in favor of affirmative action as well, stating that racism is still a problem and until there is a better solution to address it, affirmative action should be expanded.

The fourth text also supports affirmative action and criticizes the ""mismatch"" theory, emphasizing the importance of institutional climate and the success of historically black colleges in producing successful black professionals.

Therefore, all the provided texts are in favor of affirmative action."	0.0014255000000000001	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt
