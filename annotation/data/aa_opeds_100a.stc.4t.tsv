1	somewhat_against	The author expresses criticism of the current practice of affirmative action, particularly in the context of elite academic institutions. They are critical of the superficial nature of diversity that such policies may encourage, as evidenced by the focus on Elizabeth Warren's case. The author argues for a broader definition of diversity that includes a variety of experiences and perspectives, rather than just ethnic background. While the author does not call for the elimination of affirmative action, they do suggest that it needs to be reformed to prevent situations like Warren's, where tenuous claims to minority status are given weight over more substantive contributions to diversity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority, specifically Native American, during her academic career. Warren had mentioned her grandfather's high cheekbones as an indicator of her Native American heritage, a story passed down in her family. However, the New England Genealogical Society found no firm evidence of her Cherokee ancestry. This claim had previously led to Warren being celebrated as a symbol of faculty diversity at Harvard Law School. The author reflects on a similar personal experience, having believed in a Native American ancestry based on family lore, only to find no evidence in their great-grandfather's autobiography. The text criticizes the academic culture that prioritizes distant ethnic connections over genuine diversity of experiences and perspectives. It notes that Warren's working-class background, not her supposed Native American heritage, is what truly made her contribution to diversity at Harvard unique.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action as practiced within elite academic institutions, suggesting that it often leads to superficial diversity rather than meaningful inclusion of a variety of experiences and perspectives. The author argues that the emphasis on ethnic quotas and skin tones overshadows the need for diversity in political and religious views, and can sometimes benefit individuals with only a minimal connection to the minority group they claim to represent. The author believes that the case of Elizabeth Warren exemplifies the absurdity of such a narrow approach to diversity, where distant and unverified ancestral claims are given undue importance. The text suggests that the pursuit of ""cosmetic diversity"" is not a serious approach to academic diversity and calls for colleges and universities to rethink their strategies in light of a changing American demographic."	0.028929999999999997	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text mainly focuses on the author's critique of presidential leadership and vision, with a specific emphasis on the Reagan era's handling of various issues including affirmative action. While the author criticizes Reagan's approach, which may have had racial undertones and undermined affirmative action, there is not enough information to determine the author's personal stance on affirmative action itself. The summary mentions the author's view of the negative impact of Reagan's policies on affirmative action, but it does not provide a clear indication of the author's own position for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the importance of a clear and resonant vision in American presidential leadership, beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural address in 1933, where he presented a plan for economic recovery and criticized Wall Street and Washington for the nation's financial troubles. Bill Clinton also emphasized the need for vision in his 1992 Democratic Convention speech. The author criticizes the lack of vision in the 2012 presidential candidates, with Republicans offering outdated promises and Democrats failing to provide a compelling alternative. The author, a messaging strategist, notes that voters are not enthusiastic about the standard Republican narrative or Obama's mixed messages on stimulus and austerity. The text suggests that current candidates are cautious by nature and constrained by the influence of money in politics and historical legacies. It critiques Ronald Reagan's ideology, which focused on reducing government size and influence, and suggests that this ideology has led to increased inequality and the Great Recession of 2008. The author concludes by pointing out that George H.W. Bush's dismissive attitude towards ""the vision thing"" may have contributed to his being a one-term president.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides a critical perspective on the Reagan era's handling of affirmative action, indicating that Reagan's messaging appealed to white working-class males who felt threatened by the social changes brought about by the women's movement and affirmative action. The author suggests that Reagan's themes, which resonated with many Americans, were partly racial and played on the fears and anger of those who felt challenged by affirmative action policies. The text implies that Reagan's critique of government power and his deregulation efforts, which were meant to address issues like the entrenchment of government programs, also had racial undertones and served to undermine the progress of affirmative action. The author seems to view Reagan's approach to affirmative action and related social changes as divisive and detrimental to the goal of equality."	0.03362	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	0
	None	The text summary provided does not mention affirmative action directly. The discussion revolves around a Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act and the integrity of the Court's decision-making process. The author's perspective on judicial philosophy and the potential influence of political considerations on judicial decisions is discussed, but there is no clear stance on affirmative action itself. The author's concerns about political influences on the judiciary could hypothetically extend to cases involving affirmative action, but this is not explicitly stated in the summary provided.	"Summary:
In the opinion piece by William McGurn, the author discusses the reaction to Chief Justice John Roberts's decision in the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius case, in which the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act was upheld as a tax. The piece suggests that Roberts's decision has been interpreted by many as an effort to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of the Supreme Court. McGurn points out that Roberts never mentioned ""integrity"" in his opinion but that the clarity of the dissent, which was initially the majority view, contrasts with the perceived contrivance of Roberts's lead opinion. The author also notes the criticism from conservatives that liberal justices are not scrutinized for their decisions in the same way. McGurn references the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision to highlight the differing judicial philosophies between conservatives and liberals regarding the Constitution. The piece ends by questioning whether Roberts's decision was influenced by a desire to earn political capital for future cases.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action, it can be inferred from the context that the author may have concerns about the potential for political considerations to influence judicial decisions, including those on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action in the article is in relation to speculation about the Supreme Court's future agenda and the suggestion that by ruling in a particular way on the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice Roberts could be positioning the Court to take a more conservative stance on upcoming issues, including affirmative action. The author appears to be advocating for judicial decisions to be made based on legal correctness rather than political strategy or perceptions of integrity, which could imply skepticism about rulings that are perceived to be politically motivated, including those involving affirmative action."	0.028560000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	The author, John S. Rosenberg, presents a clear argument against the use of race as a factor in university admissions, which is a form of affirmative action. He believes that such practices are discriminatory and contradict American values of equality. He criticizes the administration's justification for diversity in national interest careers as paradoxical, suggesting that it promotes discrimination to achieve non-discriminatory outcomes. His perspective is that affirmative action, as it is currently implemented, undermines the principle of treating individuals without regard to race, which indicates a strong opposition to these policies.	"Summary:
The text is a letter to the editor expressing the author's viewpoint on affirmative action in university admissions, specifically in the context of the Obama administration's stance urging the Supreme Court to permit universities to consider race as a factor. The author argues that using race as a criterion, even as part of a holistic review, leads to decisions made on the basis of race or ethnicity. The author criticizes this practice as a form of euphemism and obfuscation that contradicts American principles of treating individuals without regard to race. The administration's argument that diversity is essential for national interest careers is seen by the author as paradoxical, promoting discrimination to achieve non-discriminatory outcomes.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, John S. Rosenberg, is clearly against affirmative action as it is currently practiced, which involves considering race as one factor in university admissions. Rosenberg views this approach as inherently discriminatory and in conflict with the fundamental American principle of equality irrespective of race, creed, or color. He perceives the justifications for affirmative action as contradictory and equates them to the illogical notion of destroying a village to save it, implying that affirmative action damages the very principles it claims to uphold. The author suggests that the administration's defense of diversity serves as a smokescreen for policies that, in effect, discriminate by race and ethnicity, undermining the objective of creating equal opportunities for all segments of society."	0.01947	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Jason L. Riley, presents a perspective that suggests skepticism about affirmative action, particularly regarding race-based admissions policies. Riley highlights Chief Justice John Roberts's questioning during the Fisher case, which indicates a preference for colorblind policies and a critical view of race-conscious admissions. The use of phrases such as 'true equality and ending discrimination' implies that Riley and the commentators he references favor a merit-based approach that does not consider race. Therefore, the author's stance appears to be somewhat against or possibly strongly against affirmative action, as he seems to support the notion that affirmative action policies equate to racial preferences that do not align with 'true equality.'	"Summary:
The text discusses the U.S. Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which revolves around the issue of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white applicant, claims she was denied admission to the university due to her race, arguing against the school's policy of considering race to foster diversity. Chief Justice John Roberts, who had previously sided with the liberal wing in upholding ObamaCare, showed signs of skepticism during the oral arguments for this case. He questioned the definition of an acceptable ""critical mass"" of minority students and implied that the university might be setting de facto quotas for minority admissions. Observers like Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission suggest that Roberts's questioning indicates he is unlikely to side with the liberals on this issue and remains a proponent of ""true equality and ending discrimination.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jason L. Riley, presents a perspective that Chief Justice John Roberts is inclined towards a conservative view on affirmative action, as evidenced by his line of questioning during the Fisher case and his previous rulings. Roberts's approach suggests a preference for colorblind policies and a critical stance on race-based admissions processes. The author seems to align with commentators who view Roberts as a supporter of ""true equality,"" implying a merit-based, non-race-conscious perspective on admissions. Riley's summary of the case and the views expressed by the interviewees indicate skepticism about the use of racial preferences in higher education and suggest that Roberts's vote in the ObamaCare case may not be indicative of a broader shift in his judicial philosophy towards liberal positions."	0.023129999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the positive impacts of both affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act, such as the advancement of African American voting rights and the creation of a black middle class. However, the author also points out the negative consequences, like political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The author's nuanced view recognizes the benefits while being critical of the complexities and trade-offs, indicating a belief in the need for reform or a new approach to achieve the original goals of these policies without the associated drawbacks. The author does not outright oppose affirmative action but suggests it may require reevaluation in light of current challenges.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), which was designed to end the suppression of African American voting and was overwhelmingly reauthorized by Congress in 2006. The article suggests that while the VRA has been successful in securing voting rights for black voters, it has also led to unintended negative consequences, such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The author notes that the current challenges to voting rights are different from those in 1965 and that the Supreme Court might consider the VRA's pre-clearance provision outdated and possibly strike it down. The author argues that such a ruling could prompt a necessary debate on how to protect voting rights while also restoring political moderation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author draws a parallel between the effects of affirmative action in universities and the creation of ""opportunity districts"" through the VRA. The author acknowledges the positive impact of affirmative action in helping build a middle-class post-segregation and sees a similar benefit in the VRA's role in creating a cadre of black elected officials. However, the author also implies that both affirmative action and the VRA have complexities and trade-offs, such as the potential for a ceiling on how high minority candidates can rise politically in the context of the VRA. The author's perspective suggests a recognition of the benefits of policies like affirmative action while also being mindful of their limitations and unintended consequences."	0.026709999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the voting patterns of the U.S. Supreme Court justices and their ideological alignments, with a brief mention of Justice Ginsburg's dissent in an affirmative action case. The author reports on the justices' positions and actions without inserting a personal viewpoint on affirmative action itself. As such, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the summary alone.	"Summary:
The article discusses the voting patterns of the U.S. Supreme Court justices during a particular term, emphasizing the high level of agreement among the three female justices—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—who voted together at least 93 percent of the time. These alignments are attributed to their shared liberal ideology rather than gender. The article notes a shift in Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who traditionally aligned with the liberal wing but diverged in some privacy cases. The conservative justices showed more division compared to previous years. The article also highlights the active roles of the three female justices during court arguments and their public engagements, particularly Justice Sotomayor's successful memoir and appearances. Despite their frequent agreement, there were notable splits among the female justices on significant cases, including same-sex marriage and affirmative action. Justice Ginsburg filed a lone dissent in an affirmative action case involving the University of Texas, while Justice Kagan recused herself due to prior involvement as solicitor general.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides an account of Justice Ginsburg's stance on affirmative action, mentioning her solitary dissent in a case concerning the University of Texas's affirmative action plan. This indicates that Justice Ginsburg was in favor of affirmative action policies and was willing to stand alone in her support for them. The author's report suggests that Ginsburg saw affirmative action as a legally permissible and perhaps necessary tool for addressing inequality in higher education. The perspective on affirmative action is presented factually, focusing on the justices' votes and positions without offering a personal opinion on the policy."	0.030449999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action in the text. While the text discusses issues of racism and discrimination in the context of Donald Sterling's remarks and the broader societal implications, there is no clear indication of the author's personal views on affirmative action policies. The mention of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action is brought up, but the author's perspective on this ruling is not elaborated upon, leaving their stance on affirmative action ambiguous.	"Summary:
The text recounts the reaction of South Los Angeles barbershop owner Lawrence Tolliver to the NBA commissioner's decision to ban Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life. Sterling was recorded making racist remarks, which led to widespread condemnation. The barbershop, a place of vibrant discussion on race, served as a microcosm for the broader societal views on the incident. The patrons were not surprised by Sterling's behavior, given his history of alleged discrimination. The text also touches on broader themes of racial progress and the persistent challenges that remain. It mentions other racially charged incidents and comments by public figures, suggesting a pattern of entrenched racism. The article also includes dissenting opinions on the focus of outrage and the cultural issues that are often overlooked.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. However, the article does reference a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests society might be ready to move beyond affirmative action, juxtaposing it with the ongoing issue of racism as exemplified by Sterling's remarks. The inclusion of this reference in the context of discussing Sterling's racism might imply that the author sees a disconnect between the legal landscape moving away from affirmative action and the reality of persistent racial issues. This could suggest that the author believes that despite legal changes, there is still work to be done in addressing racial inequality, which affirmative action aims to address. However, without explicit commentary from the author on the matter, any conclusions about their perspective on affirmative action would be speculative."	0.02973	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is positive, as they seem to support the University of Texas at Austin's holistic approach to admissions, which includes race as one of many factors. The author believes that affirmative action policies are necessary to achieve a diverse student body and acknowledges the benefits of such diversity in education. Additionally, the author suggests that the top 10 percent rule alone does not suffice for ensuring diversity, indicating a belief in the need for additional affirmative action measures. The author also calls for clearer guidelines from the Supreme Court, which implies a vested interest in the proper implementation and sustainability of affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author is portrayed as being in favor of affirmative action, likely 'somewhat in favor' given their acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue and the need for a cautious effort in its application.	"Summary:
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit has upheld the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policies as constitutional, even after the Supreme Court sent the case back for reconsideration. The University of Texas fills most of its seats with students in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, a policy that indirectly promotes diversity due to racial segregation in schools. The rest of the admissions are based on a comprehensive review that includes race as one of many factors. Opponents of affirmative action argue that the top 10 percent rule already achieves sufficient diversity, but the university and the 5th Circuit argue that a more holistic approach is necessary to capture a full range of diverse experiences and backgrounds. The Supreme Court has been criticized for not providing clear guidance on what constitutes a permissible affirmative action policy, particularly regarding the concept of achieving a ""critical mass"" of minority students.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, particularly the University of Texas at Austin's approach. The perspective is that affirmative action policies are necessary to achieve a diverse student body, which benefits the educational environment and prepares students for a multi-ethnic society. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue, especially given the ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools, and suggests that the top 10 percent rule alone is not enough to ensure a diverse student body. The author also calls on the Supreme Court to provide clearer guidelines for affirmative action policies while affirming the constitutionality of the University of Texas's program, which is described as a ""conscientiously designed"" and ""cautious effort"" to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent rule."	0.02681	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	0
	None	The text provided does not mention affirmative action or provide any indication of the author's stance on the topic. The focus of the text is on the handling of campus sexual assault cases, not on policies or practices related to affirmative action. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the ongoing debate about campus rape, focusing on the case of Paul Nungesser and Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University. Sulkowicz, who accused Nungesser of rape, protested the university's decision not to expel him by carrying a mattress around campus. The Daily Beast published an article with evidence that raised doubts about Sulkowicz's story, leading to a reevaluation of Nungesser's guilt in the media. The author argues that universities are ill-equipped to handle sexual assault cases due to the U.S. Department of Education's (D.O.E.) directives, which have led to procedures that many view as unfair to the accused. The author suggests that universities should demand the government rethink its guidelines, clarify the definition of sexual misconduct, and adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" for determining guilt. Finally, the author proposes that universities should work with local law enforcement to address sexual violence more effectively.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action or the author's perspective on it. Instead, it focuses on the issues surrounding campus sexual assault procedures and the role of universities and government in addressing these cases. The author is critical of the current system that universities are using to adjudicate sexual assault cases, suggesting it has swung too far in trying to protect accusers and has neglected the rights of the accused. The author's perspective is centered on the need for a fairer process that aligns with the principles of due process and a more collaborative approach with local law enforcement rather than universities handling these cases internally."	0.030200000000000005	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, William G. Bowen, is discussed in the context of his views on universities taking stands on political issues. While the summary does not provide direct comments from Bowen on affirmative action, it does indicate that Bowen believes universities should reserve actions for issues central to their educational mission, such as affirmative action. This implies that Bowen views affirmative action as a legitimate and important issue for university involvement, suggesting he is somewhat in favor of affirmative action due to its direct relevance to education. However, without explicit statements of support or opposition, it is not possible to categorize him as strongly in favor.	"Summary:
William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, addresses the rise in campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest from holdings in fossil fuel companies. He acknowledges the practical objections to divestment, such as the complexity of modern investment portfolios, potential negative impacts on endowment funds, and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment strategies. Bowen firmly believes that universities should not feel obligated to take a stand on every issue of broad social import, reserving such actions for issues central to their educational mission, like affirmative action. He argues that taking institutional stands on political issues can compromise the educational mission of universities, which should remain open to diverse arguments and avoid endorsing specific political views.

Bowen's main concern is the moral perils of divestment, highlighting potential hypocrisy in seeking institutional ""purity"" while individuals continue to consume fossil fuels and maintain personal investments in them. He also raises the responsibility to honor donor intent with endowments, the risk of individuals substituting institutional actions for personal civic responsibility, and the necessity for educational institutions to focus on improving educational outcomes and affordability. He warns against the diversion of resources and attention from core educational missions to extramural battles, cautioning against the slippery slope of using divestment as a political tool. Bowen concludes by emphasizing the complexity of contributing to the common good and the importance of prioritizing this goal.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bowen views affirmative action as an issue that directly affects educational processes and outcomes, and therefore, it has a strong claim on academia's attention and resources. He distinguishes affirmative action from other social or political issues that may not be as central to the educational mission of universities. Bowen implies that affirmative action is an integral part of the educational landscape, warranting institutional engagement and support because of its direct relevance to the core functions of higher education institutions. Unlike other issues that may not be directly related to education, affirmative action is seen as a legitimate area for universities to take a stand and actively participate in shaping educational policy and practice."	0.030969999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not directly express his personal stance on affirmative action in the summary provided. Instead, he discusses the potential impact of hate speech policies on conversations about affirmative action, indicating that he values the ability to have open discussions on the topic. His concern is primarily with ensuring that free speech is protected, including speech related to affirmative action, rather than with taking a position for or against affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize his stance on affirmative action based on this summary.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, discusses the complexities of developing a hate-speech policy at the University of California. The regents' efforts were prompted by anti-Semitic incidents, but they have not adopted the proposed ""principles against intolerance,"" opting instead to form a new committee to address the issue. Chemerinsky outlines the difficulty in balancing the commitment to free speech with the desire to prevent hate speech, and he notes the Supreme Court's stance that vague speech rules are unconstitutional. He mentions past unsuccessful attempts by universities to define hate speech and raises concerns about how policies could potentially affect discussions about affirmative action and criticism of Israel. He suggests that universities should adopt policies that reaffirm free expression while clearly defining unprotected speech, such as threats and harassment, without limiting offensive but protected speech. He also believes universities should use their own free speech rights to counteract inflammatory speech.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author raises a question about the implications of hate speech policies on discussions surrounding affirmative action. He asks whether advocacy of affirmative action could be interpreted as stigmatizing racial minorities by implying they need preferential treatment to compete, which could potentially violate such policies. This indicates that the author is aware of the sensitive and controversial nature of the topic and the potential for affirmative action advocacy to be misconstrued or challenged under broad hate speech regulations. While Chemerinsky does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided text, he is concerned about the impact of hate speech policies on the ability to have open and robust discussions about such topics. His perspective is that speech, including that related to affirmative action, should be protected to maintain the educational mission of universities and the principles of the First Amendment."	0.02821	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in terms of being for or against the policy. Instead, affirmative action is referenced as part of a broader discussion on moral issues that have become central in American politics and are used by individuals to assert moral superiority and gain self-esteem. The author's focus is on the psychological motivations behind political engagement rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action as the text does not provide a clear indication of their position on the policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the phenomenon of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where political engagement is driven by the desire to feel morally superior and boost self-esteem, rather than by practical considerations. This trend has been observed across the political spectrum and has been amplified by the rise of Donald Trump. Trump's defiance of conventional norms and controversial statements, rather than hurting his popularity, have actually increased his support among Republicans. The author argues that Trump has tapped into a shift in politics where moral issues like abortion, affirmative action, and immigration have become more central than economic ones. These issues are less amenable to compromise and provide ""psychic benefits"" to their supporters. Trump's success in defining himself and asserting moral superiority allows his followers to do the same, gaining a sense of self-esteem. The text also addresses the dilemma faced by the political establishment and mainstream media in responding to Trump's proposals, as criticism seems to only bolster his popularity. The author suggests that this cycle may not continue indefinitely, but for now, it has surprised many political observers. The broader lesson is that this politics of self-esteem is making political compromise more difficult to achieve.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus exclusively on affirmative action, the author includes it in a list of moral issues that have become politically charged and are shaping contemporary politics. The author seems to suggest that issues like affirmative action are part of the moral crusades that individuals on both sides of the political spectrum engage in to feel morally superior and to gain psychic benefits. The author implies that the passionate involvement in these issues is not solely about the legislative outcomes but also about reinforcing a sense of moral righteousness and self-esteem among supporters. The perspective on affirmative action itself is not deeply explored, but it is presented as an example of a divisive political issue that is difficult to compromise on due to its moral implications."	0.02954	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The text does not provide any specific insight or commentary on the author's stance toward affirmative action. It merely states that the Supreme Court's new term included cases on affirmative action without offering an opinion or analysis on the subject. Therefore, there is insufficient information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text provides an overview of various significant events and issues that occurred within a specific timeframe. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court announced plans to make court documents available online by 2016. A tragic attack at the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris left 12 people dead, raising questions about the limits of free speech. The Republican Party faced uncertainties regarding their healthcare strategy and concerns about losing women voters due to Donald Trump's candidacy. The Islamic State's atrocities against Yazidi women were reported, and Trump proposed building a wall, a sentiment echoed by other Republican candidates. The UN faced criticism for appointing a Saudi Arabian official to lead a human rights council panel. The U.S. House Speaker resigned, and international tensions were evident at the United Nations regarding Syria's leadership. The Supreme Court's new term included cases on abortion, religious rights, and affirmative action. There was a discussion about the media's inconsistent labeling of attackers in the U.S. as either gunmen or terrorists. Finally, Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigrants after the San Bernardino attacks played into America's fears of terrorism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly provide the author's perspective on affirmative action. It only mentions that the Supreme Court's new term included cases dealing with affirmative action, among other issues, with Justice Anthony Kennedy being a central figure. Without further context or specific commentary from the author, it's not possible to determine their view on the matter of affirmative action."	0.02053	affirmative action	txt/1752156404.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, advocates for the expansion of affirmative action to include considerations for low-income students, proposing a 'poverty preference' in college admissions. He criticizes the system that benefits wealthy students and aims to correct the imbalance that leaves high-achieving, low-income students underrepresented at elite institutions. Levy's support for affirmative action is evident in his desire to level the playing field and maintain ethnic diversity, especially in the context of potential changes to race-conscious affirmative action policies. His focus on socioeconomic disparities, alongside traditional affirmative action parameters, indicates a nuanced and supportive stance towards the policy.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, former chancellor of New York City schools and executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, discusses the obstacles that high-achieving, low-income students face in gaining admission to selective colleges. A study by the Cooke Foundation found a stark underrepresentation of low-income students at elite colleges, despite their ability to perform academically at the same level as their wealthier peers once admitted. Levy criticizes the existing ""affirmative action for the wealthy,"" such as legacy admissions and preferences in less-accessible sports, as well as the disadvantages low-income students face, including lack of test preparation, early admission constraints, and inadequate guidance counseling. He advocates for a ""poverty preference"" in admissions, which would serve as a form of affirmative action for low-income students, to level the playing field and maintain ethnic diversity, especially if race-conscious affirmative action is eliminated by the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy's perspective on affirmative action is that it should be expanded to include a ""poverty preference"" for low-income students in admissions to elite colleges and universities. He believes that affirmative action should not be limited to race or ethnicity but should also address socioeconomic disparities. Levy argues that low-income students who have achieved high academic levels despite their lack of resources and opportunities deserve more consideration in the admissions process. He suggests that this approach would not only create a fairer system based on true merit but also indirectly maintain ethnic diversity in colleges. Levy supports the continued use of standardized tests for fair comparison but emphasizes that admissions officers should give more credit to the achievements of low-income students in the context of their disadvantages."	0.02833	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The authors do not directly address their support or opposition to affirmative action based on race or gender. Instead, they focus on the concept of affirmative action as a means to increase ideological diversity within academia, specifically by including more conservative perspectives. They argue that universities should value and promote diversity of thought in the same way they claim to value racial and gender diversity. Their stance is not explicitly for or against the traditional use of affirmative action policies; rather, they advocate for the expansion of the idea of diversity to include political and ideological differences. Therefore, it is difficult to categorize their stance on affirmative action as it is commonly understood (i.e., policies aimed at benefiting underrepresented minorities in admissions and hiring). They seem to be somewhat in favor of the principle of affirmative action as a tool for enhancing diversity but are advocating for its application in a different context than it is traditionally applied.	"Summary:
Conservative professors Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr., despite their political leanings, have often defended universities against conservative criticism. However, they acknowledge that there is a political bias in academia, particularly in the social sciences, where conservatives are significantly underrepresented. The authors cite studies showing that conservative students are less likely to choose social science majors, feel uncomfortable sharing their political ideas, and avoid politicized fields in their graduate studies. They argue that this lack of political diversity can lead to a narrow range of research interests, confirmation bias, and a failure to model civil discourse. They reference the diversity rationale for affirmative action and suggest that if universities value diversity, they should also work to increase ideological diversity by including more conservative perspectives. The authors propose several reforms, such as stopping the barring of conservative speakers, questioning liberal hiring biases, advertising positions in fields popular among conservatives, and creating visiting appointments for conservative thought.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors view affirmative action through the lens of increasing diversity of thought, particularly political diversity in academia. They reference the argument made by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. in the 1978 Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which suggests that the pursuit of truth benefits from a multitude of perspectives. The authors imply that if universities truly value diversity as they claim, they should extend affirmative action to include conservative voices, not just to address historical discrimination but to enrich academic discourse and research with a wider range of viewpoints. They emphasize that such diversity is essential for universities to fulfill their role in demonstrating civil discourse and approximating truth. While they do not endorse preferences in admissions and hiring, they call for more inclusive practices that would make conservative scholars feel welcome and contribute to the legitimacy of universities in a polarized society."	0.03354	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective as described in the summary indicates a clear support for affirmative action. They agree with the Supreme Court's decision to allow race to be considered in college admissions and view it as a constitutional measure to achieve diversity in educational environments. The author criticizes opponents of affirmative action and praises Justice Kennedy for his support of the practice. The author also acknowledges the benefits of diversity in education and sees affirmative action as a necessary step towards inclusivity.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court has historically allowed public universities to consider race in admissions, and this was reaffirmed in a 4 to 3 decision regarding the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policy. The university uses a top 10 percent rule to guarantee spots for top students from all high schools and a holistic process that considers race among other factors for the remaining spots. Abigail Fisher, a white woman denied admission, claimed this violated the equal protection clause. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, upheld the university's approach, emphasizing the need for measurable goals and ongoing policy assessment. Justice Kagan recused herself, and Justice Scalia had passed away. The decision supports the idea that universities can pursue diverse student bodies, which has been shown to provide educational and social benefits.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a constitutional and necessary practice for creating diverse educational environments. They support the Supreme Court's decision to allow the University of Texas at Austin to consider race as one of many factors in admissions. The author criticizes opponents like Justice Thomas, who dismisses the benefits of diversity, and Justice Alito, who believes the top 10 percent rule is sufficient for diversity. The author praises Justice Kennedy for his pragmatic approach, which acknowledges the complexities of achieving diversity and the need for affirmative action in a society that is not yet colorblind. The author suggests that affirmative action is a tool to reflect today's America in university student bodies and to move towards a more inclusive society."	0.025379999999999996	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	Marilynne Rudick expresses a critical view of affirmative action within the specific context of Maryland's medical marijuana licensing process. She is frustrated that affirmative action, among other things, is being prioritized over the health needs of patients waiting for medical marijuana. Her criticism is focused on the delays caused by the inclusion of affirmative action policies in the licensing process, which she believes should not outweigh the program's medical objectives. It's important to clarify that Rudick's critique is context-specific and does not necessarily indicate her stance on affirmative action in general.	"Summary:
Marilynne Rudick expresses frustration over the ongoing controversy surrounding the allocation of licenses for growing medical marijuana in Maryland, emphasizing the delays this has caused in making the drug available to patients. Rudick, who has multiple sclerosis and would benefit from medical marijuana, is indifferent to the specifics of who grows the drug or where it is grown. She criticizes Maryland politicians for treating the medical marijuana program like an economic development initiative or an affirmative action program, rather than prioritizing the health needs of patients. Rudick urges politicians and regulators to expedite the process of making medical marijuana accessible to those in need.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Marilynne Rudick, seems to hold a critical view of affirmative action in the context of the medical marijuana licensing process. She implies that affirmative action, along with economic development concerns, is being inappropriately prioritized over the primary goal of the medical marijuana program, which is to provide relief to patients. Rudick suggests that the focus on affirmative action is part of the reason for the delay in the distribution of medical marijuana, indicating that she believes the program's success should be measured by its medical efficacy rather than by its adherence to affirmative action policies. It's important to note that the author's critique is specific to this context and does not necessarily reflect her views on affirmative action in other arenas."	0.01768	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The text focuses on the importance of the Senate's evaluation of Judge Neil Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and his potential impact on the Supreme Court, including how his originalist approach may affect progressive causes like affirmative action. However, the author does not provide a personal opinion or perspective on affirmative action itself, thus making it impossible to categorize their stance on the issue based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia's death over a year prior. The article suggests that rather than sticking to partisan tactics, the Senate should engage in a meaningful conversation with Gorsuch about his judicial philosophy, including his views on the Constitution, the role of precedent, and how the court should apply principles to contemporary issues. The text acknowledges Democratic frustration over the blocked nomination of Merrick Garland by Republicans but emphasizes the importance of understanding Gorsuch's approach to interpreting the Constitution as an originalist, like Scalia, and his stance on precedent. The article notes that Gorsuch has been rated ""well qualified"" by the American Bar Association and encourages the Senate to consider his judicial philosophy, as his potential confirmation could significantly influence the Supreme Court for decades.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their perspective on affirmative action; however, they do mention it as one of the progressive causes that could be affected by Gorsuch's confirmation. The author's focus is on encouraging the Senate to thoroughly examine Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, including how he might interpret the Constitution in cases related to affirmative action and other important issues. The author's concern is that Gorsuch's originalist approach might make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in society, which could include evolving views on affirmative action. However, without a direct statement, the author's personal stance on affirmative action remains unexpressed in the text."	0.029679999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's discussion is centered on the importance of neutral and clear language in ballot initiative titles and does not directly state a personal stance on affirmative action. The mention of Proposition 209 in the context of ballot summary wording indicates an awareness of the sensitivity surrounding the issue but does not convey the author's personal opinion on the policy itself. The primary concern is about potential bias in political processes, not the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of wording in ballot initiative titles, particularly when an attorney general from one political party prepares the language for a measure promoted by the opposing party. A group of Republicans sued California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, alleging that the title he gave their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees was intentionally misleading and lacked the direct words ""taxes"" and ""fees."" The text also references historical instances where attorneys general have been accused of bias in their wording of ballot summaries, such as with Proposition 209 on affirmative action and Proposition 8 on same-sex marriage. It suggests that assigning the responsibility of writing ballot titles and summaries to a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), could provide a solution to this problem. However, a recent proposal to do so failed to advance in the California legislature.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author provides an example of how the wording of ballot initiative summaries can influence voter perception by mentioning the controversy over former Attorney General Dan Lungren's decision not to include the term ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209. This proposition, which was passed in 1996, ended state affirmative action programs. The author's inclusion of this example within the broader discussion of political bias suggests a recognition of the sensitivity and impact of language used in the political arena, particularly with issues like affirmative action that are highly charged and can evoke strong responses from the public. The focus is more on the potential for political manipulation in ballot language rather than on affirmative action as a policy."	0.026389999999999997	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Bärí A. Williams, is critical of the tech industry's potential shift towards prioritizing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity. She underscores the importance of affirmative action in addressing the underrepresentation of specific groups, such as blacks, Latinos, and women. Williams advocates for a balanced approach that includes both cognitive and identity diversity, and she warns against complacency in achieving racial and gender diversity. Her perspective shows a clear concern for maintaining and advancing the goals of affirmative action.	"Summary:
Denise Young Smith, Apple's vice president of diversity and inclusion, sparked controversy by suggesting that a group of white men could be considered diverse due to their different experiences and perspectives. After backlash, she clarified her stance, emphasizing that diversity includes women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and other underrepresented minorities. The author, Bärí A. Williams, expresses concern that the tech industry is shifting its focus to ""cognitive diversity"" at the expense of addressing the low representation of blacks, Latinos, and women in the sector. This shift, according to Williams, could lead to a complacent attitude toward achieving racial and gender diversity. Williams argues that while different viewpoints are important, they should not overshadow the need for identity diversity, which involves actively recruiting underrepresented groups to counteract the tendency of employees to recommend people similar to themselves.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Bärí A. Williams, views affirmative action as a necessary measure to address the significant underrepresentation of certain groups in the tech industry. She is critical of the emerging trend that prioritizes cognitive or viewpoint diversity over the more traditional aspects of diversity, such as race and gender. Williams suggests that this trend could undermine the original intent of affirmative action, which is to create opportunities for historically marginalized groups. She emphasizes the importance of maintaining a commitment to increasing racial and gender diversity, which she considers to be ""the old-fashioned kind"" of diversity that the tech industry should not abandon. Williams advocates for a balanced approach that values both cognitive diversity and identity diversity, ensuring that efforts to include different viewpoints do not come at the cost of diminishing the representation of underrepresented communities in the tech sector."	0.03886	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of racism in America and the criticism of those who deny systemic racism implies support for measures to address racial inequality, such as affirmative action. By criticizing the resistance to affirmative action and framing it as a form of denial of racism, the author seems to advocate for affirmative action as a necessary step to confront and rectify racial injustices. The context suggests that the author views affirmative action as a tool to challenge the structures and denials that maintain racial disparities. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action appears to be in favor of it, particularly as a means to confront systemic issues rather than as a mere rectification of historical wrongs.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the pervasive issue of racism in America and the widespread denial of its existence. The author argues that denial is a defense mechanism used to maintain a sense of superiority and to avoid confronting the painful reality of racial inequality. The text references President Trump's derogatory comments about countries in Africa and his denial of racism, suggesting that both Trump's supporters and opponents are in denial about their own racism. The author highlights historical examples of racism among American presidents, from slaveholding presidents to Abraham Lincoln's views on racial separation, to underline that Trump's racism is not exceptional but part of a long-standing pattern. The piece also discusses the coded language used in politics to deny racism, such as ""law and order"" and ""war on drugs,"" and criticizes both conservatives and white liberals for their denials of systemic racism. The author concludes by suggesting that the term ""racist"" is often stigmatized as an identity rather than recognized as a description of actions and beliefs, and that true anti-racism requires a willingness to confess and confront racist behavior.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the broader context of the article. The author criticizes those who resist affirmative action policies by framing it as a form of reverse discrimination or an undeserved handout, suggesting that these critics are in denial about the racism that makes such policies necessary. By including resistance to affirmative action in the list of denials that perpetuate racism, the author appears to support affirmative action as a measure to address racial inequality and to challenge the structures of denial that prevent America from confronting its racist history and present. The author's perspective indicates a belief that affirmative action is not only about rectifying past injustices but also about acknowledging and addressing ongoing systemic racism."	0.03658	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's discussion is centered on the state of gun control debates and does not directly address their stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of how expressing certain opinions, such as opposition to affirmative action, can be career-ending in some environments. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not discussed, and therefore, it is not possible to categorize their stance on the issue based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the current state of gun control debates in the United States, initially believing that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popular among the public but face legislative hurdles. Despite numerous state laws and Congressional bills, most legislative actions have loosened rather than tightened gun restrictions. The author suggests that to pass any restrictive laws, it is necessary to depolarize the issue and respect gun owners, proposing an approach similar to how the opioid crisis is being handled. However, the response to the Parkland shooting has been the opposite, with left-wing groups polarizing the debate and using extreme rhetoric. The author acknowledges that progressives may be pursuing a broader cultural strategy to delegitimize their opponents, which could result in significant social change beyond just legislation. The author points out that conservatives have marginalized themselves by aligning with Trump, and progressives are effectively silencing dissenting opinions. The author warns that this approach may lead to a cultural victory for progressives in the culture war, but it risks creating backlash and further polarization.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express their personal view on affirmative action within the provided text. However, they do mention it in the context of discussing how certain opinions have become socially unacceptable and can lead to professional consequences. The author notes that opposition to affirmative action is one of the beliefs that, if expressed, can end a person's career, particularly in elite academic or professional environments. This observation is part of a broader commentary on how the cultural and political landscape is changing, with progressive ideologies increasingly dominating and marginalizing conservative viewpoints. The author's main focus is on the implications of these shifts for societal norms and the potential backlash they might provoke, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.029400000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective is critical of affirmative action, particularly in the context of admissions to elite high schools in New York City. The author emphasizes the importance of a merit-based system and views the proposed changes to the admissions process, which would potentially benefit underrepresented minorities at the expense of Asian American students who have succeeded under the current system, as unfair. The author believes that the success of Asian American students, who often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, demonstrates that merit and hard work should be the deciding factors for admissions, rather than race or ethnicity. This indicates that the author is somewhat against or possibly even strongly against affirmative action, as they see it as a threat to a system that rewards merit and hard work.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the issue of affirmative action in relation to New York City's elite high schools, particularly Stuyvesant High School, which has a majority Asian American student body. The author expresses amazement that President Trump hasn't commented on the situation, given the school's success and the fact that it serves as an example of upward mobility for poor students. The author then critiques New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's view that the racial composition of these schools is unjust because it does not reflect the city's demographics, with a particularly low representation of black and Hispanic students. The mayor's solution is to scrap the color-blind admissions test that currently determines entry. The author argues that this is unfair to the hard-working Asian American families who have earned their places through merit and sacrifice, and suggests that poverty is not always the determinant of academic success, as evidenced by the success of Asian American students who often come from very disadvantaged backgrounds.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author has a critical view of affirmative action, especially in the context of the New York City elite high schools. He believes that the current system, which is based on a single entrance exam, is the fairest way to determine admissions. The author's tolerance for affirmative action is limited and he opposes it in situations where it would disadvantage those who are poor but have worked hard and played by the rules, as he perceives is the case with many Asian American families. He sees Mayor de Blasio's proposal to remove the entrance exam and reserve slots for underrepresented minorities as a destruction of a system that has historically enabled the American dream for many immigrant families. The author implies that merit should be the primary criterion for school admissions and that measures to adjust racial balances should not come at the expense of those who have earned their success through effort and adherence to the existing rules."	0.031030000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	0
	None	The author, David Leonhardt, does not directly state his personal opinion on affirmative action. Instead, he discusses it from a strategic standpoint for Democrats in the context of elections and Supreme Court nominations. Leonhardt suggests that Democrats should focus on issues with broader public support rather than affirmative action, which he implies may not be a winning issue due to potential lack of widespread appeal. His perspective is centered on political strategy rather than a moral or ethical stance on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
David Leonhardt's article discusses the strategic approach Democrats should take during the confirmation process of President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee. He outlines a three-step guide for Democrats: be realistic about the likely confirmation of the nominee, don't lose hope and focus on building a political movement, and know your strengths by focusing on issues with broad public support during the midterm elections. Leonhardt suggests that while the confirmation battle may be unwinnable, the midterms offer a real opportunity for Democrats to make gains and hold Trump accountable.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author, David Leonhardt, does not explicitly express his personal views on affirmative action, he does provide strategic advice to Democrats regarding the topic. He suggests that Democrats should not emphasize social issues like affirmative action during the confirmation process or the midterm elections, as they are not the best issues for Democrats to focus on during a campaign. Leonhardt implies that affirmative action and other social issues may not have the broad public support needed to be winning issues for Democrats and that they should instead concentrate on issues where they hold a decisive advantage in public opinion, such as health insurance, taxation, corporate power, and government corruption. This perspective indicates that Leonhardt sees affirmative action as a potentially divisive issue that might not resonate with the majority of voters during critical election campaigns."	0.02593	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as somewhat in favor. While the author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, they criticize Pete Wilson's efforts to eliminate it, suggesting that those efforts were detrimental to minority communities. The author acknowledges the positive impact of affirmative action in helping minorities enter the middle class and implies that Wilson's actions against it were a reversal of his earlier, more moderate positions. The critique of Wilson's anti-affirmative action policies and the recognition of the positive outcomes of affirmative action for minorities indicate that the author leans toward a favorable view of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the career of former California Governor Pete Wilson, who is turning 85. The author acknowledges Wilson's long public service career, including his time as an assemblyman, mayor of San Diego, U.S. senator, and governor. The author credits Wilson for his moderate political approach, environmental protection efforts, acknowledgment of racial injustices, and willingness to raise taxes during a deficit. However, the author also criticizes Wilson's later actions, such as deregulating California's electricity, signing three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted illegal immigrants. These actions are seen as detrimental, leading to negative consequences for minority communities and a shift in political attitudes among Latinos. Despite these criticisms, the author sarcastically thanks Wilson for galvanizing Latino political activism and inspiring cultural movements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses a critical view of Pete Wilson's stance on affirmative action. Initially, Wilson implemented affirmative-action hiring practices as the mayor of San Diego, which the author acknowledges positively. However, the author later condemns Wilson for his efforts to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California and beyond, suggesting that Wilson's reversal on the issue had the unintended consequence of radicalizing college students. The author implies that affirmative action played a significant role in helping minorities enter the middle class, and by working against it, Wilson undermined those opportunities. The tone suggests that the author views affirmative action as a positive force for addressing historical inequalities and that Wilson's opposition to it was a betrayal of his earlier, more moderate positions."	0.02953	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The text discusses the role of Supreme Court justices and how their decisions, including those on affirmative action, are influenced by their ideologies and values. Chemerinsky emphasizes the necessity for justices to make value judgments in cases that involve determining what constitutes a 'compelling' or 'legitimate' government interest, such as affirmative action. Although he acknowledges the subjectivity and complexity in such cases, he does not express a clear position in favor of or against affirmative action, but rather comments on the nature of judicial decision-making in this context.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, a distinguished professor of law, criticizes the analogy used by Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh, that likens justices to umpires, implying that they are neutral arbiters without personal or policy preferences. Chemerinsky argues that this is misleading because, unlike umpires, Supreme Court justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law, and their decisions are influenced by their ideologies and life experiences. He highlights that the Constitution's broad language requires interpretation, and how justices vote on issues such as the 1st Amendment on campaign spending, the 2nd Amendment on gun rights, or the 4th Amendment on searches and arrests, is shaped by their values. Chemerinsky points out that determining what constitutes a ""compelling"" or ""legitimate"" government interest in cases, such as those involving affirmative action or same-sex marriage, involves value judgments that cannot be resolved by the Constitution's text or original understanding. He concludes that the confirmation process is contentious precisely because justices' ideologies matter, and nominees should not misrepresent the role to the Senate or the public.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, is that it involves a constitutional value choice rather than a straightforward legal interpretation. He suggests that when the Supreme Court considers affirmative action cases, it must decide whether achieving diversity in the classroom is a ""compelling government interest."" This determination is not something that can be answered by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding, but rather requires justices to apply their own ideologies and values. Chemerinsky's view implies a recognition of the complexity and subjectivity involved in constitutional law, particularly in areas like affirmative action where the justices' personal convictions and societal views play a critical role in shaping legal outcomes."	0.02972	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be somewhat against, as evidenced by the critical view presented of Kavanaugh's stance. The author points out Kavanaugh's harsh criticism of affirmative action policies in his private memos and his use of derogatory phrases. This criticism of Kavanaugh's skepticism or disapproval of affirmative action suggests that the author finds such skepticism problematic, particularly in the context of addressing systemic racism. Additionally, the author references Elizabeth Wydra's disapproval of Kavanaugh's language on affirmative action, further supporting the notion that the author is critical of negative views on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was marked by intense partisanship, with Democrats and Republicans deeply divided. Democrats attempted to halt the proceedings due to withheld documents, while Republicans accused them of political posturing. Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican support. The hearings were noted for revealing little about Kavanaugh's views, continuing a trend of non-disclosure of judicial perspectives. Historical context highlighted the shift from bipartisan support for nominees to current polarized confirmation processes. Kavanaugh's stance on key issues like abortion, employment discrimination, and healthcare remained unclear, and his past comments on affirmative action raised concerns. His perspective on same-sex marriage rights appeared cautiously neutral, avoiding a direct stance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Kavanaugh's stance on affirmative action, pointing out the contrast between his praise for the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling and his private memos that harshly criticized affirmative action policies. Kavanaugh's use of phrases like ""naked racial set-aside"" and ""racial spoils system"" in reference to affirmative action is highlighted as concerning, especially given the historical context of systemic racism these policies aim to address. The author suggests that Kavanaugh's past comments reflect a skepticism or disapproval of affirmative action, which is unsettling for those who see such measures as necessary to rectify entrenched racial inequalities. This perspective is supported by Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, who finds Kavanaugh's language on affirmative action upsetting and indicative of a broader threat to civil rights and racial justice."	0.035019999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt	0
	None	The summary provided does not directly address the author's perspective on affirmative action in the traditional sense of policies aimed at addressing historical injustices and promoting diversity within institutions or employment. Instead, it discusses various viewpoints on Europe's immigration policies. Since the term 'affirmative action' is not used in its conventional sense, and there is no explicit discussion about the author's stance on affirmative action policies, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss Hillary Clinton's comments on Europe's immigration policies and their consequences. Pierre Bertrand criticizes Clinton for seemingly endorsing policies that contradict her image as a human rights advocate, despite her previous praise for Angela Merkel's welcoming stance towards Syrian refugees. Lorna Salzman commends Clinton for recognizing that uncontrolled migration has fueled right-wing populism in Europe, which was exacerbated by the left's failure to acknowledge cultural differences between Europeans and refugees. Jane Carey argues that the rise of the far right is not caused by immigration itself but used as a pretext for their agenda, and stresses that the root causes of migration, such as international interference in conflicts and climate change, must be addressed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The term ""affirmative action"" is typically used in the context of policies that support members of disadvantaged groups who suffer from discrimination within a culture. In the letters, the term appears in a different context, referring to Angela Merkel's decision to welcome Syrian refugees into Germany. Pierre Bertrand seems to view Merkel's actions as an example of affirmative humanitarian action, implying a positive perspective on this specific form of affirmative action. However, the letters do not directly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action in the traditional sense of policies aimed at addressing historical injustices and promoting diversity within institutions or employment. Instead, they focus on the broader implications of immigration policies and political responses to them."	0.02243	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author is critical of affirmative action, highlighting its failures to achieve intended goals, benefiting the well-off within targeted groups, and exacerbating racial tensions. They provide examples where progress has been made without affirmative action, implying that these policies may not be the most effective way to address inequality.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of affirmative action, focusing on protests in Malaysia and drawing parallels with the situation in the United States. In Malaysia, 55,000 people rallied to support race-based policies that favor the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These policies, which include advantages in education, housing, government jobs, and business opportunities, were initially introduced to create racial balance and uplift the economically disadvantaged Malays. However, they have been criticized for benefiting mostly the well-off Malays, extending beyond their intended end date, and exacerbating ethnic tensions.

In the U.S., affirmative action has also been contentious, particularly in education, with lawsuits and debates over the policies' effectiveness and fairness. The author points out that affirmative action in both countries has not necessarily achieved its goals, as evidenced by the continued disparities between racial groups and the fact that progress made by minority groups can occur without such policies, as seen with the economic status of Malays in Singapore and the black middle class in the U.S. before the widespread implementation of affirmative action.

Author's Perspective:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They argue that while these policies are designed to help the underprivileged, they often benefit those who are already well-off within the targeted groups. The author suggests that affirmative action can fail to address the root causes of inequality and can even exacerbate racial and ethnic tensions. They point to examples where the absence of affirmative action, such as in Singapore for Malays or in the University of California system for black students, has resulted in better economic outcomes and academic achievements. The author implies that affirmative action is not a universally effective solution and that its actual impact on progress and equality is questionable."	0.026619999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action, as conveyed through the summary, suggests that Moynihan supported affirmative action within a broader framework of social policies aimed at addressing racial inequality. While the author, Jacob Weisberg, does not delve deeply into Moynihan's stance on affirmative action, it is clear from the summary that Moynihan viewed it as an essential part of government intervention to aid black families. The summary does not indicate any opposition or skepticism from Moynihan regarding affirmative action, but rather includes it as one of the policies he advocated for. Therefore, based on the summary provided, the author can be categorized as somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as there is an implied support through Moynihan's advocacy for a range of policies, including affirmative action, to address social issues.	"Summary:
The article discusses the career and legacy of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a U.S. Senator known for his intellectual prowess and contributions to public policy. Moynihan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he had a hand in creating decades earlier. The author, Jacob Weisberg, paints Moynihan as a complex figure with a penchant for historical knowledge and deep insights into social issues, but also as someone who struggled to translate his ideas into effective legislative action. Moynihan is depicted as a man of great intellect and erudition, who was often more interested in being right than in being politically effective. Weisberg discusses Moynihan's relationships with various presidents, his role in the Senate, and his perspectives on issues such as welfare reform, health care, and social policy. Moynihan's career is characterized by his critical intelligence and his tendency to prioritize analysis and critique over practical political achievements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jacob Weisberg, provides a detailed account of Moynihan's perspective on affirmative action within the context of his broader views on social policy and race relations. Moynihan supported policies aimed at enhancing the stability and resources of the black family, including jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance, and affirmative action. His support for affirmative action was part of his broader goal to stimulate government commitment to addressing the problems facing black families in America. However, Moynihan's approach to affirmative action and other remedies was not explored in depth in his 1965 report on the black family, known as the Moynihan Report. The report sparked controversy and was criticized by many on the left as blaming the victim and potentially providing fodder for racists. Despite this, Moynihan saw affirmative action as a necessary component of a range of policies aimed at addressing racial inequality, and his support for it was consistent with his general advocacy for active government intervention in social issues."	0.11958	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion highlights the college admissions scandal as evidence that wealth plays a more significant role in college admissions than race. The author suggests that affirmative action is necessary to counterbalance the advantages of wealth and social status, indicating a belief that affirmative action promotes diversity and fairness. The text does not express a strong advocacy or opposition but seems to acknowledge the complexities of the issue, pointing towards a somewhat favorable view of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses several instances where President Trump and other political figures have been accused of amplifying divisive rhetoric, particularly around issues of race, religion, and class. Trump's support for a Fox News host who made remarks about Rep. Omar's hijab is seen as amplifying Islamophobia. Senator Chris Coons criticized Trump for disparaging the late John McCain and suggested the president should apologize. The college admissions scandal has reignited debates on affirmative action, with opponents arguing that the scandal proves elite colleges cannot be trusted to vet students fairly, while defenders argue that wealth, more than race, plays a larger role in college admissions. Senator Amy Klobuchar criticized Trump for amplifying racial and religious hatred, which she believes is divisive. Chris Wallace from Fox News acknowledged Trump's history of stoking anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments. An Australian anti-immigration lawmaker's incident of getting egged after blaming Muslim immigration for the New Zealand shootings is also mentioned. Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege, yet positioning himself as a unique voice on immigration issues, is questioned in light of other candidates like Julian Castro and Kamala Harris who also have relevant perspectives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a necessary policy to counterbalance the advantages that wealth and social status bestow upon certain individuals in the college admissions process. The scandal involving wealthy parents using illicit means to secure their children's admission to elite colleges is seen as evidence that the system is skewed in favor of the affluent and that race-based affirmative action is not the primary issue. The author suggests that the defenders of affirmative action have a valid point in arguing that the presence of minority students at elite colleges is overshadowed by the number of students from rich families. This perspective indicates a belief that affirmative action is a tool to promote diversity and fairness in an education system that is otherwise influenced by economic disparities."	0.024579999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, discusses the challenges she faces as an African-American woman in academia, particularly in being recognized and respected for her qualifications. While the summary does not explicitly state her stance on affirmative action, it does mention that she acknowledges the negative perceptions and backlash against the policy. She also notes that individuals like herself, who are presumed to have benefited from affirmative action, have had their reputations tarnished. This indicates that she is aware of the policy's intended purpose and the issues surrounding its implementation and perception. However, due to the lack of clear support or opposition to affirmative action in the text provided, it is not possible to categorize her stance definitively. Therefore, based on the information given, we must categorize her stance as 'neutral' on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author, Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, discusses her experience with titles in academia. Unlike her mostly white male colleagues who may go by first names or nicknames, Dr. Berry insists on being addressed with her title, ""Dr. Berry,"" particularly in the classroom. She explains that this insistence is not out of pretension but as a response to the presumption by some that as a female and African-American, she is less qualified. Dr. Berry has faced challenges such as having her qualifications, lecture style, and grading questioned—treatment she believes her white male colleagues do not experience. She asserts that insisting on her title is a professional standard and a message to other female and black students that they can achieve similar positions. Despite the small percentage of African-American women in engineering academia, Dr. Berry remains hopeful for a future where titles and respect are automatically afforded to professors regardless of their gender or race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges the negative perception that has been created around affirmative action, particularly due to anti-affirmative-action ideologues. She notes that the policy's legitimacy has been demolished and that individuals who are presumed to have benefited from it, like herself (even though she clarifies that she did not), have had their reputations tarnished. Dr. Berry's perspective seems to be that while affirmative action was intended to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, the backlash and misconceptions around the policy have added to the challenges faced by those it aimed to help, including being perceived as less qualified or as token hires. Despite these challenges, she continues to work towards changing the face of engineering to be more inclusive and diverse."	0.03101	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author relays The Washington Post's supportive stance on affirmative action, highlighting the editorial's approval of the University of Texas at Austin's policies. The Post's editorial is described as considering the university's affirmative action policy as a 'prime example' of a well-designed program that should pass judicial scrutiny. The text indicates that The Washington Post believes such programs are necessary for achieving diversity and complementing race-neutral admissions strategies. The author does not express a personal opinion but conveys The Washington Post's favorable view towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses various editorial opinions from different publications on several issues. The New York Times editorial focuses on a bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy to end bulk collection of Americans' phone records, increase transparency, and establish a privacy rights panel in court. The Washington Post editorial supports the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action policies, which complement the top 10 percent program with a holistic review for diversity. The Boston Globe comments on Massachusetts' legislative response to the Supreme Court's objections to the state's buffer-zone law around abortion clinics. The Guardian praises Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, for her focus on wage growth in addition to employment. The Globe and Mail reports progress in managing the decline of honeybee populations, with a hopeful outlook despite ongoing challenges. Lastly, The Korea Herald criticizes Japan's rejection of the UN's call for investigations into wartime sex slavery and an apology to ""comfort women,"" noting historical revisionism's negative impact on relations with victimized Asian countries.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents The Washington Post's perspective, which is supportive of affirmative action policies, specifically those at the University of Texas at Austin. The editorial views the university's policy as a ""prime example"" of the type of affirmative action that should withstand judicial scrutiny. The policy is seen as ""conscientiously designed"" to achieve diversity and complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program. The Post suggests that when the case is reviewed by the Supreme Court, the justices should affirm the legality and permissibility of such affirmative action programs. This perspective indicates a belief in the value of affirmative action as a means to promote diversity and equal opportunity in educational settings."	0.02928	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The authors collectively argue against the mismatch theory and advocate for the continuation of affirmative action policies, emphasizing the benefits for minority students and the need to address educational and racial disparities. Their arguments are supportive of affirmative action, with a focus on the positive outcomes and the necessity to combat systemic racism through such policies. They do not express neutrality, opposition, or a lack of concern; instead, they provide reasons that affirmative action is both beneficial and necessary.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss the concept of affirmative action in education and its implications. William Kidder criticizes the ""mismatch"" theory, which suggests affirmative action harms minority students by placing them in schools where they may be underqualified. He points out that peer-reviewed research largely discredits this theory, especially at the law school level, and emphasizes evidence that suggests minority students benefit from attending more selective universities.

Rosiland Jordan argues for the necessity of affirmative action, highlighting societal valuation of degrees from certain institutions and the existing educational disparities that create a need for such policies. She criticizes the stigmatization of minority students and calls for equal academic standards and resources.

Jane McAlevey contends that affirmative action should continue until a better solution to address racism is found and effectively implemented. She implies that the current system disproportionately disadvantages young black individuals.

Randal Maurice Jelks challenges the assumptions of the mismatch theory, which are often based on test scores. He emphasizes the importance of institutional climate and notes the success of historically black colleges in educating black students, often more effectively than predominantly white elite institutions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express support for affirmative action, each presenting a different angle on why it remains necessary and beneficial. They challenge the validity of the mismatch theory and emphasize the broader social and educational inequalities that affirmative action seeks to address. They express a shared view that affirmative action is a tool to combat systemic racism and to promote educational opportunities for minority students. The overarching perspective is that affirmative action is not only beneficial but also necessary in the current societal context, where educational and racial disparities still exist."	0.02484	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text; rather, it is mentioned as part of a broader discussion on Nixon's presidency and progressive policies. The author acknowledges affirmative action as one of the significant liberal reforms during Nixon's tenure, suggesting a recognition of its importance in civil rights advancements. However, the text does not provide a clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is contextualized within a historical perspective rather than a contemporary debate, and there is no explicit support or critique of the policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the negotiation strategies of President Barack Obama, particularly in relation to the debt ceiling agreement. The author recounts a conversation with a Hollywood dealmaker who criticizes Obama for not using the potential of unilateral executive action to strengthen his position against Republican opposition. The dealmaker believes Obama should have been more ambiguous and threatening, like Richard Nixon who used the ""Madman Theory"" to intimidate North Vietnamese leaders during the war. The author reflects on Obama's reasonableness and contrasts it with the toughness and vision of past presidents like FDR, Clinton, and surprisingly, Nixon. The article then describes Nixon's progressive policies, which are often overlooked due to his negative reputation. Nixon's presidency saw significant liberal reforms, including environmental protection, civil rights advancements, and social welfare improvements. The author suggests that judging Nixon by today's ideological standards creates cognitive dissonance, especially for those who lived through his era.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action, recognizing it as one of the progressive policies implemented during Nixon's presidency. The author notes that Nixon expanded the staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, increased federal spending on civil rights, and began affirmative action in federal hiring. This acknowledgment of Nixon's role in advancing affirmative action suggests that the author views it as a positive and necessary measure for civil rights and equality. The author's broader commentary on Nixon's liberal policies, including affirmative action, indicates a respect for the policy's historical significance and its role in promoting social justice, despite the general negative perception of Nixon's presidency."	0.02949	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action. The reference to affirmative action in the text is more about the conservative views of the Federalist Society members, rather than the author's personal stance. The author focuses on the broader conservative movement and its impact on legal policy and judicial appointments. The mention of affirmative action is incidental and serves to illustrate the types of policies that members of the Federalist Society have grumbled about in the past. Since the author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated or directly addressed in the summary, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on the issue.	"Summary:
The text describes an event at the Mayflower Hotel where Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor from the University of Texas, expressed his dissatisfaction during the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala. The Federalist Society, a powerful conservative legal group, was celebrating its influence in Washington, with members of the Bush cabinet and Justice Antonin Scalia in attendance. While the administration's officials were praised for their conservative stances, Graglia criticized them for not being bold enough, suggesting the repeal of all antitrust laws. Other conservatives expressed frustration over various issues, such as state lawsuits against tobacco companies. The author reflects on the Federalist Society's rise to power, noting that they are now influencing legal policy and judicial appointments. The author also comments on the Society's focus on past liberal adversaries and criticizes Kenneth Starr for abandoning principles of judicial restraint. The author concludes by warning Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans to be vigilant about the potential far-right takeover of the courts and to defend mainstream principles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action negatively, as the text references a time when the author encountered Federalist Society members at Harvard Law Review who would grumble about affirmative action and the New Deal. The context suggests that the author associates these complaints with a broader conservative dissatisfaction with liberal policies. Although the author does not explicitly state a personal stance on affirmative action, the mention of it alongside conservative grumbling implies that the author may perceive it as a contentious issue among conservatives who oppose certain liberal policies."	0.02925	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt	0
	None	The author, Michael Teachout, does not provide a clear indication of his personal stance on affirmative action. His discussion is centered on the composition of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet and the importance of having a cabinet that can work cohesively with the president. He mentions General Colin L. Powell's support for affirmative action only to illustrate the presence of some ideological diversity within the cabinet, not to express his own views on the policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the focus of the text and cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor, written by Michael Teachout, responds to a criticism of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet choices as lacking ""significant ideological diversity,"" as mentioned in a previous editorial. Teachout argues that it is unreasonable to expect a president to appoint cabinet members with opposing views to his own, as this could undermine the ability to govern effectively. He points out that Bush's cabinet does include members with differing opinions (e.g., General Colin L. Powell on affirmative action and Governor Christie Whitman on abortion), but these differences are within the context of their specific roles. Teachout emphasizes the balance of power inherent in the U.S. government's three branches and implies that the cabinet should be composed of individuals with whom the president can work collaboratively.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Michael Teachout, does not explicitly state his personal perspective on affirmative action. However, he uses General Colin L. Powell's stance on affirmative action as an example of ideological diversity within Bush's cabinet, suggesting that Powell supports affirmative action and that this view differs from Bush's own perspective. Teachout's primary focus is on the practicality and functionality of the cabinet, rather than on the specific policies or issues like affirmative action."	0.01747	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not explicitly discuss their stance on affirmative action; rather, they are focused on addressing the political dynamics and accusations within the judicial confirmation process. The mention of affirmative action is only to correct a falsehood used in a political context, not to express a viewpoint on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the 106th Congress for its cynicism and hypocrisy, highlighting several instances of its questionable actions. The author points out the appointment of conferees who oppose a patient rights bill, the allocation of excessive profits to student loan companies, and the passage of bills that undermine states' rights and environmental protections. The most egregious example cited is the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White's nomination to a federal judgeship, primarily due to Senator John Ashcroft's false accusations that White was ""pro-criminal"" and biased against the death penalty. Despite White's record of upholding death sentences, Ashcroft's opposition was politically motivated to appear tough on crime. The author dismisses the accusation of racism against Republicans for rejecting White, instead condemning the confirmation process and the unjust treatment of a qualified judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their perspective on affirmative action. However, they mention it in the context of a false claim made by Senator Ashcroft regarding Justice White's dissent in a case. Ashcroft inaccurately cited White's dissent as being based on the trial judge's opposition to affirmative action, which was not true. The trial judge's statement was about switching political parties due to his views on representing minorities, which was unrelated to affirmative action. The author's focus is more on exposing the falsehood and political maneuvering in the confirmation process rather than on the merits or demerits of affirmative action itself."	0.02429	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the value of affirmative action in promoting workplace diversity but criticizes the specific implementation in the Piscataway case. The author appreciates the goal of maintaining racial diversity but questions the decision to lay off a teacher solely based on race. Additionally, the author recognizes the potential risk the case posed to affirmative action laws and seems to approve of the strategic settlement to prevent a Supreme Court ruling that could have endangered affirmative action policies. The author's perspective indicates a belief in the importance of affirmative action but also suggests a need for careful application and perhaps a more nuanced approach to its implementation.	"Summary:
The Piscataway, New Jersey, school board settled a lawsuit with Sharon Taxman, a white teacher who was laid off in 1989 to retain a black teacher for diversity reasons. The settlement was reached to avoid a Supreme Court ruling that might have threatened affirmative action laws nationwide. Civil rights groups contributed to the settlement payment. The case was seen as a precarious one for affirmative action supporters because the Supreme Court might have ruled against race-based employment decisions, potentially impacting voluntary affirmative-action plans. The school district's intention to maintain diversity was seen as well-intentioned but poorly executed, and the Clinton Administration had reversed its support for the school's decision.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as a valuable tool for maintaining workplace diversity but recognizes that the Piscataway case was not the ideal scenario to uphold such practices. The author suggests that the school board's decision to lay off a teacher based on race was not the best approach, even though the goal of racial diversity was commendable. The author also implies that a Supreme Court decision on this case could have had far-reaching negative consequences for affirmative-action policies. By settling the case, the author believes that supporters of affirmative action made a strategic choice to avoid a potentially unfavorable legal precedent. The author indicates that a future Supreme Court case will likely address the broader legality of considering race in employment decisions, but the Piscataway case was not the right one for this debate due to its unique circumstances."	0.02083	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's nuanced support for affirmative action is evident in their acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue and the legitimacy of considering race in certain contexts to promote diversity and prevent discrimination. They are critical of absolutist opponents and argue for the value of affirmative action in fostering diverse environments and maintaining public confidence in institutions. The author's perspective is not absolutist but rather supportive of affirmative action within the bounds of the Supreme Court's criteria for its use.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton Administration's stance on an affirmative action case involving the Piscataway, N.J., school board, which chose to lay off a white teacher over a black teacher in an effort to promote racial diversity. Initially supporting the school board, the Administration later conceded that this action violated the civil rights of the white teacher. The Administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court suggesting a compromise, arguing that while the school board's action was not justified, affirmative action still has a place beyond remedying past discrimination. The text highlights the broader debate on affirmative action, including the stance of absolutist opponents who argue against any consideration of race in public hiring and education, as exemplified by a California law and a Federal appeals court ruling against the University of Texas Law School's affirmative action policy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive but nuanced. They acknowledge the complexity of the issue, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's criteria that government use of racial preferences must be to remedy overt discrimination or to achieve a ""compelling"" public goal and be ""narrowly tailored"" to that goal. The author argues that while the Piscataway school board's specific action was not justified, there are legitimate and compelling reasons to consider race in public hiring, such as in police departments or in educational institutions to foster a diverse environment that teaches students to work across racial lines.

The author criticizes the absolutist opponents of affirmative action who have gained traction in the courts and public debate, suggesting that a color-blind approach is impractical and incompatible with a commitment to prevent racial discrimination. They point to recruitment efforts aimed at minority candidates as necessary measures to prevent discrimination, even if they involve race-based distinctions. The author believes that considering race in public employment and in the judiciary is important for legitimacy and public confidence. They urge the Supreme Court to recognize the value of racial diversity and not to adopt an absolutist color-blind view that would undermine efforts to prevent racial discrimination."	0.03033	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	Cahn supports affirmative action as a necessary measure to correct an admissions process that fails to produce university classes reflecting society's racial diversity. His agreement with the need for affirmative action, even though his rationale differs from Matsuda and Lawrence's, indicates that he is in favor of the policy. However, since he offers a critique of the existing defense and suggests an alternative perspective, he does not seem to be uncritically or 'strongly' in favor but rather shows a nuanced support. This suggests he is 'somewhat in favor' as he believes in the policy's necessity but also engages critically with its common justifications.	"Summary:
In a letter to the editor, Timothy R. Cahn addresses an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence about affirmative action, titled ""Myths About Minorities."" Cahn argues that Matsuda and Lawrence missed an important point in their defense of affirmative action. He states that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admissions based on race, then the lack of proportionate racial representation in universities must be due to factors other than merit. Cahn believes affirmative action is necessary, not just to address overt discrimination as Matsuda and Lawrence suggest, but to correct an admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect society's racial diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Cahn appears to support affirmative action but offers a different rationale than the one provided by Matsuda and Lawrence. He suggests that affirmative action should be used to adjust for biases in the admissions process that lead to a lack of racial representation in universities, rather than solely to combat direct discrimination. Cahn's perspective implies that affirmative action is a tool to create a student body that mirrors the racial composition of society, ensuring that all racial groups have fair access to educational opportunities."	0.01698	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	Evan Edwards defends the Republican Party's stance against affirmative action, indicating that he believes the policy is not aligned with the party's core conservative values. He also argues that opposing affirmative action does not imply being anti-women, suggesting he sees the policy as unnecessary or potentially detrimental to the principles he supports. His perspective is clearly against affirmative action, but without further context on the intensity of his views, it is difficult to gauge whether his opposition is strong or moderate.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor is a response to Frank Rich's column titled ""Angry White Woman,"" which discussed Tanya Melich's decision to leave the Republican Party. The author, Evan Edwards, criticizes Melich, calling her a ""fink"" and arguing that the Republican Party in New York City is known for being liberal to ultra-liberal, as opposed to the ultra-right elements she may be referring to that exist in the South. Edwards points to the formation of the New York State Conservative Party in the 1960s as a reaction to liberal Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller, John Lindsay, and Jacob Javits. He also cites the inclusion of AIDS activist Mary Fisher at the 1992 Republican convention and contrasts it with the Democrats' exclusion of Gov. Robert P. Casey's anti-abortion stance at their convention. Edwards reminds readers that the Republican Party has a history of appointing women to high positions, including the Supreme Court, and that many women held significant roles in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. He argues that the party's stance against affirmative action and certain welfare policies does not equate to being anti-women. Edwards suggests that Melich would be more suited as a Democrat, particularly a Ruth Messinger Democrat, based on her contributions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Evan Edwards, expresses opposition to affirmative action. He defends the Republican Party's stance against affirmative action, implying that opposition to such policies does not necessarily mean the party is against women. Edwards seems to believe that affirmative action is not aligned with the core beliefs of the Republican Party, which he describes as catering to moderates and conservatives. He suggests that the party's principles should not be compromised for the sake of the ""big-tent"" idea, which aims to include a broad range of political views within the party. This indicates that Edwards views affirmative action as a policy that may not be consistent with the foundational values of the Republican Party."	0.02395	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed in the text. While the text discusses themes relevant to affirmative action, such as diversity and historical efforts to promote racial harmony, there is no clear indication of the author's stance on modern affirmative action policies. Without explicit statements or clear implications regarding the author's views on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize their stance.	"Summary:
The text is an exploration of race and identity through the lens of the ""aloha spirit"" in Hawaii, as experienced and studied by Dr. Kristin Pauker, a psychology professor of mixed ancestry. The author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, reflects on his own mixed background and delves into Dr. Pauker's research on essentialist views of race among children in both Hawaii and the mainland U.S. He discusses the history of racial categorization and its economic and social motivations, including the role of the African slave trade and the evolution of racism. The text also examines Hawaii's unique historical and cultural context, including its high percentage of mixed-race individuals, its labor movement's impact on racial harmony, and the tradition of ethnic joke-telling. It concludes with the suggestion that understanding the ecological limits of the world and the interdependence of people might lead to a shift in attitudes toward race.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the text does touch on themes related to affirmative action, such as the importance of diversity, the benefits of a mixed-race society, and the historical and economic factors that have shaped racial discrimination. The author discusses the deliberate efforts in postwar Hawaii to foster interracial unity and equal representation among ethnic groups in union leadership, which can be seen as a form of proto-affirmative action. This historical example suggests that the author recognizes the potential for deliberate interventions to dismantle racial barriers and create more equitable opportunities, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action policies."	0.085	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Harry Piotrowski, appears to criticize the inconsistency in the application of affirmative action principles by highlighting the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court. Piotrowski points out that Scalia, an opponent of affirmative action, may have benefited from a form of it due to Reagan's desire to appoint a justice of Italian heritage. This suggests that Piotrowski is critical of those who oppose affirmative action yet may benefit from similar practices. However, the author's own stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the criticism is more focused on the perceived hypocrisy of Scalia and Reagan rather than on the policy of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly in favor or against but is concerned with the application and perception of affirmative action among its critics.	"Summary:
The text includes letters to the editor regarding the selection of a Supreme Court justice by President Obama. Robert B. Newlin from Arlington suggests that Obama should nominate an ""ordinary person"" with a nonpolitical background, such as a business executive or military leader, to bring a new perspective to the court. Richard L. Sheffield from Columbia criticizes the use of the term ""ordinary Americans,"" suggesting it carries connotations of inferiority and proposes simply using ""Americans"" instead. Harry Piotrowski from Crofton points out the irony in Ronald Reagan appointing Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court due to his Italian heritage, despite Reagan and Scalia's opposition to affirmative action, and implies that Scalia believes he earned his position on his own merit.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author (Harry Piotrowski from Crofton) takes a critical stance on affirmative action, particularly in the context of the Supreme Court. He highlights the irony of President Ronald Reagan, a known opponent of affirmative action, appointing Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court because of his Italian heritage, which can be viewed as a form of affirmative action. This suggests that Reagan may have had an ""emotional commitment"" to having a justice of Italian extraction on the court, which contradicts his public stance against affirmative action policies. The author seems to imply that affirmative action is seen as a negative practice by those like Scalia, who believe that positions should be earned solely through merit. However, the author also suggests that Scalia himself benefited from a form of affirmative action, despite his belief that he deserved his position entirely on his own qualifications. The perspective is one of pointing out the perceived hypocrisy in the application of affirmative action principles by its critics."	0.025359999999999997	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the Supreme Court's decisions and Chief Justice John Roberts' role in recent cases, particularly the DACA case. While the author reflects on the court's alignment with public expectations and mentions the court's decision to uphold affirmative action in the past, there is no explicit commentary or analysis on affirmative action in the current context. Therefore, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the summary alone.	"Summary:
The text discusses a series of decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case and the role of Chief Justice John Roberts. Initially, there was uncertainty about how the conservative Chief Justice would rule, given his history of upholding President Trump's travel ban and dismantling the Voting Rights Act. However, in a 5-4 decision, Roberts sided with the majority to block the Trump administration's attempt to end DACA, emphasizing the program's reliance interests and the administration's failure to provide a reasoned decision for its termination. The author reflects on the Supreme Court's role in society and how it sometimes aligns with public expectations, suggesting that the court does not always give the current administration a free pass. The text also mentions other significant rulings, including protection for LGBTQ individuals in the workplace and upcoming decisions on abortion, religion, the president's tax returns, and the Electoral College.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, as evidenced by the reference to the Supreme Court's 2002-2003 term, where the court upheld affirmative action in higher education. The author suggests that the court's decision to uphold affirmative action was part of a broader alignment with societal expectations and a move away from the conservative direction it had been taking. This perspective indicates that the author believes the Supreme Court should be attuned to social changes and public sentiment, and that affirmative action is an example of the court responding to those dynamics."	0.034230000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Jennifer Lee, presents a clear and positive stance on affirmative action. She refutes the notion that affirmative action leads to racial quotas, which are unconstitutional, and provides evidence that Proposition 209 did not affect Asian American admission rates. Lee emphasizes the need for affirmative action to address systemic discrimination and supports its role in improving opportunities for Asian Americans in education and employment. Her advocacy for the restoration of affirmative action in California and the emphasis on the support of Asian American voters for such measures, particularly those who understand the historical context of discrimination, indicates a strong endorsement of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential restoration of affirmative action in California through Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5), which will be on the ballot to repeal Proposition 209, a law that banned consideration of race, sex, or ethnicity in public sectors since 1996. While some Asian immigrants oppose affirmative action, fearing it may impose quotas on university admissions, the author argues that this perspective is incorrect and that affirmative action does not lead to racial quotas, which are unconstitutional. The author states that Proposition 209 did not change Asian American admission rates to the University of California system and that affirmative action can help Asian Americans overcome barriers in employment and career advancement. The text also highlights the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in leadership positions despite their high presence in academic institutions. Furthermore, the author points out the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies in addressing discrimination, as evidenced by the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of Asian American voters support affirmative action, especially U.S.-born and third-generation Asian Americans, who are more likely to understand its importance and the history of systematic discrimination.

Author's Perspective:
The author, Jennifer Lee, a professor of sociology, holds a positive view of affirmative action. She believes that affirmative action is necessary to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities. Lee argues that affirmative action will benefit Asian Americans by enhancing their opportunities in university admissions, employment, and career advancement. She provides evidence that Proposition 209 did not significantly alter the rate of Asian American admissions and that race-neutral policies fail to address the realities of racial discrimination. Lee also notes that the majority of Asian Americans support affirmative action and emphasizes the importance of this demographic advocating for equitable opportunities for all marginalized groups. She urges Asian Americans to demonstrate their support for affirmative action at the ballot box in November, refuting the idea that affirmative action laws like Proposition 209 level the playing field, instead asserting that they perpetuate historic discrimination."	0.030510000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the DOJ's stance on civil rights under the Trump administration, including its support for lawsuits against affirmative action. This criticism suggests the author believes affirmative action is an essential part of civil rights enforcement and is necessary for promoting equality. The author's disapproval of the Trump administration's opposition to affirmative action indicates a favorable view of affirmative action as part of the DOJ's mission.	"Summary:
The text discusses the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice (DOJ), highlighting its post-Civil War establishment to replace private attorneys with full-time professionals and to enforce civil rights for African Americans. It criticizes the DOJ's operations under the Trump administration and Attorney General William P. Barr, mentioning presidential interference, leniency for political allies, and a weak stance on civil rights enforcement. The author acknowledges the inherent partisanship in the DOJ due to its political leadership but suggests that a reduction in federal criminal law could mitigate politicization and abuse. The text emphasizes the importance of the DOJ's role and the need for its leaders to uphold professionalism, impartiality, and a focus on civil rights. The author concludes that the Trump administration has failed in this regard and calls for the next president and attorney general to urgently address these issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Trump administration's stance. The author disapproves of the DOJ's support for lawsuits against affirmative action in college admissions under Trump and Barr, indicating a belief in the importance of affirmative action as part of the DOJ's civil rights mission. The text suggests that the author views affirmative action as a necessary tool for promoting civil rights and equality, and sees the Trump administration's opposition to it as a deviation from the DOJ's core responsibilities and founding spirit."	0.02194	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical view of Reagan's opposition to affirmative action, along with the context of discussing structural racism and the need to address historical and ongoing racial injustices, implies that the author supports affirmative action. The author's negative portrayal of Reagan's attempts to abolish affirmative action and the suggestion that it was part of a racially divisive strategy indicate that the author is in favor of affirmative action policies as a means to combat racial inequality.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of structural racism in America, highlighted by the murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on Black Americans. It criticizes President Donald Trump for his history of racist actions and rhetoric, and then delves into the racial politics of former President Ronald Reagan. It draws parallels between Reagan and Trump, noting that Reagan used the same slogan ""Let's Make America Great Again"" and engaged in racially coded language. The author recounts Reagan's history of opposing civil rights legislation, promoting ""law and order"" politics, and his infamous campaign speech near the site of a civil rights tragedy in Mississippi. The text argues that Reagan's presidency marked a decline in race relations, with attempts to weaken the Voting Rights Act, opposition to affirmative action, and policies that contributed to mass incarceration of Black Americans. The author suggests that while Reagan's racism was less overt than Trump's, it was equally damaging and set the stage for Trump's rise.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of Reagan's stance on affirmative action, indicating that Reagan sought to abolish it. The author views Reagan's opposition to affirmative action as part of a broader assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s. Reagan's administration argued that white men were the real victims of reverse discrimination, a perspective the author clearly disagrees with, suggesting that it was part of Reagan's racially divisive politics. The author's perspective implies support for affirmative action as a necessary measure to address historical and ongoing racial injustices and sees Reagan's opposition to it as detrimental to race relations in the United States."	0.031120000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Melanye Price, emphasizes the political labor and contributions of Black women to the Democratic Party, leading to Kamala Harris's selection as a vice-presidential candidate. Price critiques the notion of reducing Harris's selection to affirmative action, highlighting the organized efforts and influence of Black women in politics. The author's perspective suggests a recognition of merit and impact rather than attributing achievements to affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The article emphasizes the significant contributions of Black women to the Democratic Party and the political landscape, leading to the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s vice-presidential running mate. It argues against viewing Harris's selection merely as affirmative action or an isolated event, highlighting the consistent political labor of Black women as voters, strategists, and candidates. The author cites the high voter turnout and loyalty of Black women to the Democratic Party and notes their increasing organization and demand for political representation and policies that address their community's needs. The piece references historical struggles for voting rights and the ongoing efforts of organizations that support Black women in politics. It frames Harris's selection as a collective victory for Black women and a step forward in their political ascendance, rather than a single achievement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melanye Price, appears to take a critical stance against the reduction of Kamala Harris's selection as a vice-presidential candidate to an affirmative action choice. Price emphasizes that Harris's selection is the culmination of decades of political work by Black women and should not be misconstrued as merely a tokenistic gesture based on race and gender. Instead, the author views it as a testament to the political power, sophistication, and influence that Black women have built within the Democratic Party. Price suggests that the strategic and organized efforts of Black women in politics have been instrumental in shaping electoral outcomes and should be acknowledged as such. The author advocates for recognizing the merit and impact of Black women's political labor rather than attributing their achievements to affirmative action policies."	0.02664	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text expresses a high level of admiration for Ruth Bader Ginsburg's work and her approach to affirmative action. The author specifically highlights Ginsburg's recognition of the need to address systemic discrimination and persistent racial inequities, as well as Ginsburg's attention to the historical context of such issues in her judicial decisions. The author's reference to Ginsburg's majority opinion in the Virginia Military Institute case and her impact on pay discrimination law through her dissent in the Lilly Ledbetter case suggests a strong alignment with Ginsburg's affirmative stance on affirmative action. The author's respect for Ginsburg's commitment to equality and civil rights further indicates that the author is in favor of affirmative action, as they see it as a crucial component of Ginsburg's broader legal philosophy, which they admire.	"Summary:
The text is a personal reflection on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's influence on the author, a woman lawyer who was inspired by Ginsburg's keynote address at a conference for women lawyers in the 1970s. Ginsburg, the founder of the ACLU Women's Rights Project and later a Supreme Court Justice, is portrayed as a trailblazer for gender equality, advocating for a world free from gender-based assumptions. The author admires Ginsburg's legal advocacy, her approach to incremental legal change, and her respect for precedent. Ginsburg's perspective on affirmative action is highlighted through her majority opinion in the Virginia Military Institute case and her attention to systemic discrimination. The author also notes Ginsburg's impact on pay discrimination law through her dissent in the Lilly Ledbetter case. Ginsburg's influence extended beyond her own decisions to those of her colleagues and lower-court judges in a range of areas, including gender and race discrimination, access to justice, and disability rights. The author describes Ginsburg as a reluctant dissenter who felt the moral weight of non-unanimous decisions, yet her dissents increased with the court's changing composition.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a strong proponent of affirmative action, with Ginsburg recognizing the need to address persistent racial inequities in various societal sectors. Ginsburg's judicial philosophy included a careful analysis of social and historical contexts, and she would meticulously recount the history of racial and gender-based classifications in her decisions. By detailing the data that demonstrated ongoing racial disparities in housing, education, and employment, Ginsburg acknowledged the long-term effects of ""centuries of law-sanctioned inequality."" Her perspective was forward-thinking, prefiguring contemporary debates about systemic discrimination. The author clearly respects Ginsburg's approach to affirmative action, seeing it as part of her broader commitment to equality and civil rights."	0.03263	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The text summary provided does not explicitly address the author's stance on affirmative action. The focus of the text is on racial injustice, particularly in the context of police violence and historical lynchings. While the author does mention an anecdote related to affirmative action, it is only in passing and does not offer a clear perspective on the policy itself. The summary does not provide enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the aftermath of Breonna Taylor's death, where no police officer was charged with her killing, but only with endangering her neighbors. Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, used the term ""mob justice"" to describe the protests demanding accountability for officers who kill Black people. The author criticizes this phrasing, highlighting the historical use of mob justice in the form of lynchings in Southern states, which were often supported by the criminal justice system. The article emphasizes the desire for the Constitution and justice system to work equally for all, including African Americans. It also touches on the broader impact of such incidents on the Black community's trust in government and their safety expectations. The text includes personal reflections on the author's experiences with racial hostility and the persistent need for Black Americans to recalibrate their expectations in the face of systemic injustice.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. However, the author does mention it in a broader context of racial prejudice experiences shared by Black individuals. The author refers to a scenario where a Black student is told by a favorite high school teacher that affirmative action would help them get into a great college, implying that the realization of their racial identity is often tied to negative experiences or perceptions related to race. This anecdote suggests that affirmative action is seen as a factor in the educational opportunities for Black students, but the author does not delve into a detailed discussion or critique of affirmative action policies within the scope of the text provided."	0.02921	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their criticism of the Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale and their concern over the impact of a conservative Supreme Court on the future of race-conscious admissions policies. They argue that affirmative action is essential for addressing systemic inequalities and achieving a diverse student body, and they cite national data on educational disparities to bolster their argument. The author's defense of Yale's commitment to diversity further demonstrates their strong support for affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece by a former Yale student-body president, discussing the challenges and progress of diversity and affirmative action at Yale University. The author highlights the slow pace of progress in addressing the university's historical ties to slavery and the current lack of faculty diversity. The Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants, is criticized as an attempt to roll back affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies. The author argues that removing race considerations in admissions would significantly decrease the representation of African American and Hispanic students at elite institutions, citing the example of Harvard University. National data is presented to show the disparities in school poverty and racial segregation in education, which impact the future advancement of students from underrepresented backgrounds. The author defends Yale's commitment to diversity in its admissions process and expresses concern over the potential impact of the Trump administration's actions and the conservative shift in the Supreme Court on the future of affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is a strong advocate for affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies. They believe that these practices are essential for creating a diverse and excellent student body and for addressing the systemic inequalities present in the education system. The author views the Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale as an attack on efforts to achieve equity in higher education and a step backward for diversity and inclusion. The commitment to maintaining race-conscious admissions is seen as a moral and educational imperative, necessary for the progress of the university and the broader society. The author fears that the conservative majority in the Supreme Court could threaten the existence of affirmative action, which they see as a foundation for building a more equitable future."	0.02774	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical response to Trump's and Kushner's statements, which downplay the systemic issues faced by African Americans and imply a lack of desire for success, indicates a strong understanding and concern for racial inequalities. The author's defense of the economic progress made by African Americans prior to Trump's presidency and the criticism of the notion that Trump is a savior to the Black community suggest a belief in the agency and capability of African Americans. While the text does not explicitly mention affirmative action, the author's emphasis on historical and ongoing barriers, systemic inequalities, and the need for tools to address these issues implies a stance that is supportive of affirmative action as a means to promote equality and counteract these barriers.	"Summary:
The text is a critical response to statements made by Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner regarding their perceived benefits to the African American community. The author expresses outrage at Trump's claim that he has done more for Black people than any president since Abraham Lincoln, comparing Trump's attitude to that of a slave master. The author argues that Trump's rhetoric is racist and self-gratifying, perpetuating stereotypes of African Americans as helpless and in need of a white savior. Kushner's comments are also criticized for suggesting that Black people do not want to be successful. The author refutes Trump's claims by highlighting the economic progress of African Americans prior to Trump's presidency and denounces the notion that Trump is a savior to the Black community. The author also points out the hypocrisy of Trump and Kushner, both of whom inherited wealth, and criticizes their ignorance of the historical interplay between race and economics in America.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is an important equalizer that has sought to provide a bridge to economic parity for African Americans. The author views affirmative action as a necessary tool that helps to address systemic inequalities and supports the advancement of African Americans in spite of historical and ongoing barriers. The text suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a positive force that has been fought against by the same system that has offered little or no assistance to African Americans, implying that the author supports the continuation and strengthening of affirmative action policies."	0.02823	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Richard Rodriguez, discusses his personal experiences with affirmative action in his collection 'Hunger of Memory.' His critical perspective on affirmative action stems from his belief that while it is meant to help, it does not address the deeper issues of cultural assimilation and personal achievement. Rodriguez's narrative suggests that he values the idea of working through cultural barriers and adopting common language and norms to succeed in the public sphere, even at the cost of distancing from one's cultural heritage. This indicates that he is somewhat against affirmative action, as he sees it as a flawed solution that does not fully address the complexities of cultural identity and integration.	"Summary:
The text provided is a review of five essay collections by different authors, highlighting their unique styles and thematic focuses. Mary McCarthy's ""On the Contrary"" (1961) is praised for its critical intelligence and contrarian views on a range of topics, from politics to literature. Leonard Michaels' essays, edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009), are noted for their personal touch and storytelling quality. Vladimir Nabokov's ""Speak, Memory"" (1951) is described as a beautifully written memoir of his aristocratic upbringing and subsequent life changes. Richard Rodriguez's ""Hunger of Memory"" (1982) is commended for its honest portrayal of the author's experiences with bilingual education and affirmative action. Finally, Susan Sontag's ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" (1980) is recognized for its cultural criticism and personal reflections on other intellectuals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Richard Rodriguez, presents a critical perspective on affirmative action in his collection ""Hunger of Memory."" His personal experiences as the son of working-class parents and a ""scholarship boy"" inform his opposition to affirmative action. Rodriguez suggests that while he understands the distance between his intimate home life, conducted in Spanish, and his public, English-speaking school life, he believes that affirmative action is not the solution. He discusses the painful loss of closeness with his family as he became more assimilated into a world of higher education and culture, a process he felt was necessary for his success. Rodriguez's stance is that he had to give up certain aspects of his cultural identity to gain educational and social advancement, and he views this trade-off as a complex but necessary part of his personal development. His argument is rooted in his belief that personal achievement and integration into the public sphere of American life require adopting the common language and cultural norms, even if it means distancing oneself from one's cultural heritage."	0.03438	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	The author, Devon Westhill, expresses criticism toward the race- and sex-based selection criteria of the Marin UBI program, highlighting concerns about its legality and fairness. By sharing a personal anecdote and discussing the potential for such criteria to exacerbate racial discord and be perceived as racially unjust, Westhill's perspective indicates a stance against using race and sex as factors in affirmative action policies. His role at the Center for Equal Opportunity further suggests his commitment to equal treatment and non-discrimination, reinforcing his critical view of the program's exclusionary approach.	"Summary:
Marin County in California is launching an experiment to provide a ""universal basic income"" (UBI) of $1,000 a month to 125 low-income residents starting in May. The program, funded by both the Marin Community Foundation and the Marin County Board of Supervisors, is designed to support low-income individuals. However, unlike a similar program in Stockton, the Marin experiment explicitly targets ""mothers of color,"" excluding white mothers and fathers from eligibility. This race- and sex-based selection criterion has raised legal concerns under the California Constitution's equal-protection clause, which mandates strict scrutiny for racial and sex classifications.

Author's Perspective:
The author, Devon Westhill, is critical of the Marin UBI scheme's exclusionary criteria based on race and sex, suggesting that it could be seen as legally dubious and unfair. Westhill shares a personal anecdote to illustrate how his own white mother, who raised three black children in poverty, would have been excluded from the program despite facing similar challenges as black mothers. He argues that such exclusion constitutes racial injustice and could deepen racial discord. Westhill also expresses concern that well-intentioned policies like UBI could be tainted by accusations of racism and could be perceived as a guise for reparative racial justice, potentially undermining their effectiveness in addressing poverty. Westhill's role as president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity informs his emphasis on equal treatment and non-discrimination."	0.02305	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of legacy admissions and the current funding model for public education indicates a concern for racial and class inequalities in the education system. Although the author does not explicitly advocate for affirmative action policies, their focus on systemic inequities and the need for policies that address both racial and class disparities suggests they are likely in favor of affirmative action, at least in principle. The criticism of how affirmative action is applied at elite universities implies that the author may support a reformed approach to affirmative action that more effectively addresses inequality. The author's acknowledgment of the paradox in framing policies also indicates a nuanced understanding of the issue.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the systemic inequities faced by Black Americans, with a focus on the education system. The author acknowledges the media's attention on police violence, especially after George Floyd's murder, but points out that there are other critical racial disparities that are not as visible and do not receive as much coverage. The author cites the significant difference in life expectancy between Black and white men in the U.S. and the racial segregation in American public schools. The text criticizes the funding model for public education, which results in poor children attending poor schools and vice versa. The author also criticizes legacy admissions in universities, zoning laws that segregate neighborhoods, and a tax system that disproportionately audits low-income earners, who are often Black. The author suggests that while there are no perfect solutions, early childhood programs, baby bonds, child tax credits, job training, and a higher minimum wage can help reduce racial disparities. However, they note a paradox where framing policies as addressing racial rather than class inequality can diminish public support. The author concludes by questioning whether the increased awareness of racial discrimination following the Floyd case can translate into progress in other areas of systemic inequality, such as education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially regarding its application in elite universities. They point out that legacy preferences and donor considerations function as a form of affirmative action for already privileged children, which perpetuates inequality. This system is criticized as it contributes to a greater representation of students from the wealthiest 1 percent compared to those from the poorest 60 percent. The author's view seems to be that affirmative action, in this case, is misdirected and reinforces class and racial disparities rather than addressing them."	0.04115	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's text reflects a perspective that values diversity, tolerance, and equality, which are indicative of a supportive stance towards affirmative action. The mention of reversing discriminatory policies and the concern over the potential rollback of progress in promoting equality under a new governor suggest that the author sees affirmative action as a positive force for social justice. The author's fear that a Republican governor might not recognize issues like racial discrimination and may reverse criminal justice reforms further implies a belief that affirmative action is necessary to combat systemic inequalities. Therefore, the author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as it aligns with the broader values they endorse.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the potential recall of California Governor Gavin Newsom, emphasizing the importance of upholding California's values, which are at risk if Newsom is recalled. These values include protecting natural resources, embracing diversity, tolerance, and equality, supporting democracy through accessible voting, and caring for marginalized communities. The author criticizes the leading Republican recall candidates, particularly Larry Elder, for not aligning with California's culture and policies that aim to build a more welcoming, equitable state. The text highlights the state's progress under Newsom's leadership in environmental protection, reversing discriminatory policies, expanding voting rights, and bolstering social safety nets. It warns that these advancements could be undone if Newsom is replaced by a Republican governor who may not recognize issues like racial discrimination and may reverse criminal justice reforms.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action and views it as part of California's values of diversity, tolerance, and equality. The text mentions past discriminatory actions, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and ballot measures against affirmative action, suggesting that the state has evolved from those times and now seeks to reverse discriminatory policies. The author fears that the progress made in promoting equality and fighting intolerance, including support for affirmative action, could be threatened if Governor Newsom is recalled and replaced by a candidate who denies the existence of racial discrimination and inequality. This perspective suggests a belief in the importance of affirmative action as a tool to address historical injustices and to promote a fair and inclusive society."	0.02899	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, but it is mentioned as one of several issues that may not resonate with the broader electorate. The author suggests that while affirmative action is important to the left-wing activist base, it might alienate some voters, including voters of color. This indicates that the author is somewhat critical of the Democrats' focus on affirmative action from a strategic electoral perspective, rather than a principled stance on the policy itself. The author is concerned with the political viability of the issue rather than its moral or social implications.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived liberal bias in the media and its potential impact on the Democratic Party's electoral success. The author reflects on a column by Ezra Klein concerning the views of progressive election analyst David Shor, who believes that the left's focus on issues that excite its young, well-educated activist base can be politically detrimental. Shor argues that topics such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action may not resonate with the broader electorate, including voters of color. Some progressives, like strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio and law professor Ian Haney Lopez, argue for messaging that shifts the political conflict from racial groups to economic inequality, using racism as a tool of the elite. The author suggests that while Shor's strategy of prioritizing popular ideas may be less inspiring, it could be more effective in gaining power for Democrats. However, implementing such a strategy might be challenging due to the idealistic nature of the young individuals involved in campaigns and media. The media's leftward shift may create a bubble where unpopular ideas are protected, affecting campaign coverage and making it difficult for Democrats to adopt more broadly appealing positions. As media outlets increasingly rely on a highly educated, politically engaged subscriber base, there's a risk that the Democratic Party could alienate the majority of the population that does not hold a bachelor's degree.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical perspective on affirmative action, suggesting that it is one of the issues that, while important to the left-wing activist base, may not be as popular with the broader electorate, including some voters of color whom such policies are intended to benefit. The author implies that the Democrats' focus on affirmative action could be one of the factors that alienates potential voters, hinting at a need for the party to reconsider its priorities and messaging to align with what the majority of voters want. The text does not delve deeply into the merits or faults of affirmative action itself but rather discusses its political implications and popularity among different voter demographics."	0.03177	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action indicates a nuanced stance. They support the original intent of affirmative action to provide equal opportunities but are critical of what they perceive as its current iteration, which they suggest leans towards discrimination as a remedy for past injustices. The author seems to advocate for a return to traditional liberalism, where affirmative action is a tool for equality, not a form of retribution based on identity politics. This perspective suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action in principle but against certain contemporary applications of it. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'somewhat in favor' because they back the concept's original goal but are critical of its current execution.	"Summary:
The author expresses deep disillusionment with the current state of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. Having started as a Democrat and later becoming an independent, the author has covered six presidential campaigns and has written about politics for over two decades. Despite voting mostly Democratic, the author feels alienated by the extreme directions both parties have taken. The Republican Party is criticized for its Trumpist leanings, which are seen as a threat to the republic's foundations, including the integrity of elections and the inclusivity of American citizenship. The Democratic Party, while a preferable alternative to autocracy, is accused of abandoning traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin and engaging in a misguided cultural revolution that emphasizes identity politics and retribution.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author has a nuanced view on affirmative action. While they support the concept of affirmative action as it was originally intended during Lyndon B. Johnson's era, which aimed to provide equal opportunities to historically marginalized groups, they are critical of the current interpretation of affirmative action by some on the left. The author references Ibram X. Kendi's book ""How to Be an Antiracist"" and disagrees with Kendi's assertion that the remedy to past and present discrimination is future discrimination. The author sees this approach as a call for social upheaval rather than a path to true equality. They believe in rededicating to the ideal of true equality and not reducing individuals to demographic categories. The author suggests that the current political climate has left little room for traditional liberalism, which once embraced affirmative action as a means to achieve equality without resorting to identity-based vengeance or retribution."	0.03785	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's text does not directly address affirmative action but instead focuses on the issue of hate crime legislation and its implications for freedom of speech and thought. The text suggests a concern for government overreach and the policing of beliefs, which could extend to views on affirmative action. However, since the text does not explicitly state a position on affirmative action itself, but rather on the broader issue of thought policing, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary. The text's emphasis on freedom of speech and thought suggests that the author might be critical of any form of government intervention that could suppress differing viewpoints, including those on affirmative action, but this is an inference and not explicitly stated.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers for hate crimes, questioning the constitutionality and rationale behind punishing individuals for their beliefs in addition to their criminal actions. The author argues that while the murderers' racism influenced their decision to kill Arbery, punishing them for their racist thoughts in addition to their actions is a step towards totalitarianism. The author references Jacob Sullum's assertion that the federal trial was symbolic and doubled as a virtue signal by the government, highlighting its stance against bigotry. The text also touches on the potential for government overreach in punishing individuals for their thoughts and speech, and the slippery slope this creates towards censorship and the policing of beliefs. The author concludes by suggesting that the government should focus on its fundamental responsibilities rather than conducting show trials that emphasize its disapproval of certain ideologies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as critical. The text suggests that in today's America, the concept of ""hate speech"" has been stretched to include expressions of ideas that offend certain groups, including opposition to race-based affirmative action. By listing opposition to affirmative action alongside other ideas considered ""hate speech,"" the author implies a disapproval of the suppression of such views and the potential consequences of labeling them as such. The perspective presented seems to advocate for freedom of speech and thought, even when those thoughts are controversial or offensive to some, and warns against the dangers of government intervention in policing ideologies, which could include stances on policies like affirmative action."	0.02844	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue of affirmative action and recognizes the evolution of individuals' stances over time, as exemplified by Justice O'Connor's shift from opposition to support. The author appreciates the influence of personal experiences and interactions on shaping views and advocates for a broad understanding of diversity. The emphasis on Judge Jackson's background and the critique of the focus on race in her nomination discourse suggest the author values affirmative action for its role in enhancing a variety of perspectives, not just as a racial corrective. Therefore, the author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, acknowledging its importance while also calling for a more nuanced and comprehensive consideration of diversity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the evolution of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's views on affirmative action and federalism, influenced by her colleague Justice Thurgood Marshall. Initially, O'Connor was known to oppose affirmative action and favored states' rights, but by the end of her tenure, she upheld affirmative action in university admissions and moderated her stance on federalism. The author suggests that Marshall's influence on O'Connor, while not the sole factor, should not be dismissed. The text then transitions to discuss President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, drawing parallels with Justice Breyer whom she is set to replace, and highlighting the significance of her background and potential impact on the Court. The author emphasizes the importance of considering multiple aspects of diversity, beyond race, that Judge Jackson would bring to the Court. The text critiques the focus on race in the discourse surrounding her nomination and underscores her inspiring American success story.

The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, noting Justice O'Connor's evolution from opposition to support. The author respects O'Connor's journey and implies that personal experiences and interactions, such as those with Justice Marshall, can shape one's perspective on such policies. The author also seems to advocate for a broad understanding of diversity and its benefits, which includes but is not limited to race. This suggests a belief in the value of affirmative action not just as a racial corrective but as a tool for enhancing a variety of perspectives within institutions like the Supreme Court. The author's perspective highlights the potential for individuals, such as Judge Jackson, to influence the conversation on affirmative action and other issues of diversity and equity within the Court."	0.05083	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, David Bernstein, does not directly state his position on affirmative action, but he emphasizes the importance of open discussion and critical thinking about the topic within educational settings. His criticism of ideological instruction and advocacy for a balanced approach to teaching about systemic racism suggests that he values multiple perspectives on issues, including affirmative action. Although he is critical of the way race and racism are currently taught in schools, this criticism is more about the pedagogical approach rather than the substance of affirmative action policies. Therefore, without a direct statement on his stance towards affirmative action itself, it is not possible to accurately categorize his position as for or against. However, his support for debate and discussion on the topic indicates that he is not 'not concerned' with affirmative action. Given the information provided, the most accurate categorization would be 'neutral,' as he advocates for discussion and critical thinking on the topic without revealing his personal stance.	"Summary:
David Bernstein discusses the polarized debate on teaching race and racism in American schools. He criticizes the highly ideological instruction in public schools, exemplified by an ""Antiracist Audit"" in Montgomery County Public Schools, which he feels prescribes a singular perspective on systemic oppression and the black American experience. Bernstein argues that such teaching methods suppress debate and critical thinking, citing his son's experiences at school as an example of the stifling of diverse viewpoints. He advocates for a more balanced approach that includes multiple perspectives on systemic racism and acknowledges the complexity of factors contributing to racial disparities. Bernstein calls for an educational approach that incorporates various narratives, such as the ""1619"" and ""1776"" versions of American history, and exposes students to a range of ideas, including those that are controversial or demonized by either side of the political spectrum.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author, David Bernstein, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the text, he does express concern about the lack of open discussion and debate on the topic within educational settings. He criticizes the vague wording used in an executive order by Virginia's new governor, which could potentially restrict teaching about various sides of the affirmative action debate. Bernstein seems to support the idea that students should be exposed to different perspectives on affirmative action, as part of a broader educational philosophy that values open inquiry and critical thinking. He suggests that discussing affirmative action and Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences should be a normal part of a social studies curriculum. Overall, Bernstein's perspective is that the topic of affirmative action, like other issues related to race and racism, should be open to discussion and debate in schools, and students should be encouraged to explore multiple viewpoints to form their own informed opinions."	0.03506	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not directly state their position on affirmative action, but the inclusion of concerns about the future of affirmative action in the context of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade suggests that they view affirmative action as a valuable civil right that could be at risk. The sense of doom and fear for the rollback of civil rights, including affirmative action, indicates that the author likely sees affirmative action as a positive measure in need of protection. However, without explicit support or opposition to affirmative action itself, we cannot accurately categorize the author's stance as 'strongly' or 'somewhat' in favor or against. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization is 'neutral' with a lean towards concern for its future.	"Summary:
The text comprises letters to the editor expressing concerns about the implications of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Linda Linton feels a sense of doom and questions whether the U.S. will continue to feel like her country, worrying about the future of affirmative action and the rights of various groups. Michael D. Abell laments the potential rollback of civil rights to a pre-Brown v. Board of Education era, fearing a new era of Jim Crow. George Miller warns that Title IX, which protects against gender discrimination in education, could be at risk given the court's rationale in the Roe v. Wade decision. Finally, Julie Thostenson argues that pregnancy is a result of personal actions and implies that the issue of reproductive rights is one of personal responsibility.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not directly elaborate on the author's perspective on affirmative action, it is clear that there is concern about its future. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has raised fears that other rights, potentially including affirmative action, could be under threat if the Supreme Court applies the same rationale that rights must have ""deep roots"" in history, as mentioned in the context of Title IX. The authors express apprehension that the Supreme Court's current direction could lead to a dismantling of various civil rights protections, including those provided by affirmative action."	0.02544	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors appear to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. They express concern over the Supreme Court's potential reversal of a decision that supports affirmative action in school admissions. The authors connect affirmative action to the historical context of the Brown v. Board of Education decision and suggest that moving away from affirmative action is a departure from the court's legacy of protecting civil rights. While the authors do not explicitly advocate for affirmative action, they imply that it is a part of the broader commitment to civil rights and making courts accessible to marginalized groups.	"Summary:
The text discusses the 2022 ""year-end report on the federal judiciary"" filed by Chief Justice John Roberts. It notes that the report was more notable for what it omitted than what it included. Chief Justice Roberts began by recalling the desegregation efforts in the 1950s and the threats faced by judges at that time, thanking Congress for passing a law to protect judges' personal information. However, the report did not address several significant issues facing the court, such as the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices, the leak of a draft decision on abortion rights, and the decline in federal court use. The authors mention that the decline in cases could be attributed to the Supreme Court's decisions that have limited access to litigation, particularly through interpretations of the Federal Arbitration Act. They argue that Congress needs to act to ensure access to courts and protect federal rights.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express concern that the Supreme Court seems poised to reverse a decision upholding affirmative action in school admissions. They view affirmative action as a remedy that followed from the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which the entire court supported in 1954 and reaffirmed in 1958. The authors imply that the current court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, is moving away from the legacy of protecting civil rights and making courts accessible to all, which includes the support for affirmative action measures. They suggest that the court's anticipated move to reverse affirmative action signifies a departure from the court's historical commitment to civil rights and a reluctance to open doors to marginalized groups."	0.03115	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	The author, William McGurn, is critical of affirmative action policies, particularly in the context of the changes in TJ's admissions policy and the failure to notify National Merit Scholars. He argues that these policies have led to a decrease in Asian-American admissions and suggests that the focus on equity has become a 'war on achievement.' McGurn views these developments as a departure from meritocracy and implies that they are discriminatory against Asian-American students. His perspective indicates a belief that affirmative action, as currently practiced, has negative consequences and contradicts its original intent.	"Summary:
William McGurn's article discusses the controversy surrounding several high schools in Northern Virginia, including Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ), which failed to inform students of their recognition by the National Merit Scholarship Program. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil rights investigation into the matter. The context of these events is set against changes in TJ's admissions policy, which aimed to increase the representation of African-American and Hispanic students but resulted in a reduction of Asian-American students. McGurn also criticizes the local education system's focus on equity as ""a war on achievement"" and suggests that the failure to notify students of their awards may not have been a mere bureaucratic error, but rather a part of an agenda that seems to target high-achieving students, particularly those who are Asian-American.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William McGurn, appears to view affirmative action and the broader equity agenda in a negative light. McGurn suggests that these policies have evolved from well-intentioned efforts to prevent discrimination into a ""war on achievement"" that particularly affects Asian-American students. He points to the changes in TJ's admissions policy, which were made to diversify the student body but led to a decrease in Asian-American admissions, as evidence of this. McGurn also highlights instances in which school officials' actions and statements seem to de-emphasize individual achievements, which he interprets as a disdain for meritocracy. Additionally, he implies that the treatment of Asian-American students contradicts the narrative of America as a racist society where minorities cannot succeed, thus challenging the underlying premises of affirmative action. Overall, the author's perspective is critical of affirmative action as it is currently implemented in these educational contexts, suggesting that it has become discriminatory against certain groups it was initially designed to help."	0.03029	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	Vivek Ramaswamy's perspective on affirmative action is clearly outlined in the summary provided. He criticizes affirmative action policies and advocates for their complete elimination, citing a belief in meritocracy and the idea that affirmative action undermines the accomplishments of certain racial groups and causes resentment. Ramaswamy's policy positions include overturning affirmative action and restoring merit-based systems, indicating a strong opposition to the practice.	"Summary:
The text is an op-ed by Vivek Ramaswamy where he announces his candidacy for President of the United States. Ramaswamy argues that America is experiencing a national identity crisis, lacking a sense of purpose as traditional values like faith, patriotism, and hard work decline. He criticizes the rise of ""secular religions"" and what he terms ""woke"" ideologies. Ramaswamy proposes a new American Dream centered on the ""unapologetic pursuit of excellence"" and meritocracy. He outlines several policy positions, including securing the border, ending lottery-based immigration, overturning affirmative action, and restoring merit-based systems in various aspects of American life. He also advocates for free speech, economic independence from China, and a return to American ideals that transcend diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Vivek Ramaswamy is strongly opposed to affirmative action. He views it as a system that disfavors qualified applicants, particularly those who are white or Asian-American, leading to resentment and undermining the accomplishments of black and Hispanic individuals. Ramaswamy believes affirmative action violates the principle of meritocracy, which he champions as a cornerstone of his vision for America. He pledges that, if elected president, he will eliminate affirmative action across the American economy, rescind Executive Order 11246 which mandates race-based hiring preferences for federal contractors, and direct the Justice Department to prosecute what he deems to be illegal race-based preferences. His stance is that merit should be the sole determinant for success in America, and he views affirmative action as antithetical to this principle."	0.029160000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the Supreme Court for its handling of affirmative action cases, suggesting that the Court is discarding established legal standards to reach outcomes that align with a right-wing agenda. The author's use of terms such as 'morally and politically offensive' indicates a disapproval of the Court's approach. While the author's primary focus is on the Supreme Court's overreach and partisanship, their criticism of the Court's actions in affirmative action cases points to a stance that is at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they seem to oppose the Court's decisions that potentially undermine it.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on the current state of the United States Supreme Court, accusing it of acting as a partisan political body rather than a judicial institution. The author argues that the Court has overstepped its constitutional role by overturning established laws, ignoring legal doctrines and precedents, and creating standing in cases where it should not. The Court is accused of making policy decisions, particularly in cases involving affirmative action, LGBTQ+ discrimination, and student debt forgiveness. The author suggests that the Court's actions undermine democracy and that the justices appear to be guided by partisan interests rather than legal principles, as evidenced by public perception and the lack of mandatory ethics rules for the justices. The commentary calls for reforms such as term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion, and ethics reform to restore the Court's legitimacy and ensure the survival of democracy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decisions on affirmative action as morally and politically offensive to many Americans. They criticize the Court for casting aside legal principles such as stare decisis (the doctrine of respecting precedents) without proper justification, suggesting that the Court is willing to discard established legal standards to reach desired outcomes that align with a right-wing agenda. The author implies that the Court's handling of affirmative action cases is emblematic of its broader departure from legitimate judicial review and its encroachment into the realm of policy-making, which they believe is detrimental to the principles of self-government and democracy."	0.03218	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in terms of whether they are for or against it. The text focuses more on the implications of the Supreme Court's decision and the changing job market due to AI rather than on a clear stance on affirmative action itself. The author does express concerns about the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on students of color and hints at skepticism regarding the view that affirmative action is outdated. However, without a clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, it is difficult to categorize them definitively. The mention of ongoing consequences for diversity suggests some level of concern, but the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's stance as either for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the implications of the Supreme Court's decision to end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, in the context of the rising influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market. The author suggests that with AI taking over many white-collar jobs, the value of a college education may be diminishing, and it may be more practical for individuals to develop skills for physically demanding jobs that AI cannot perform. The author also reflects on the emotional and creative aspects of human work that AI cannot replicate, such as the unique voice and style of a writer. The text touches upon the potential shift in the labor market towards more outdoor and skilled labor, and the possible humanizing effect of new AI technologies that facilitate human interaction. It concludes with concerns about the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on students of color and the future of academia, with a quote expressing a desire for the Supreme Court to be more like an AI chatbot.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a now-rejected policy that aimed to ensure diversity and opportunity in higher education, particularly for students of color. The author suggests that the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action is seen as a move that belongs to a past generation and is no longer deemed necessary by the court. However, the author hints at skepticism about this view, suggesting that many Americans might still see the value in affirmative action. This perspective is illustrated by the final quote from Suzanne Szostak, who ironically wishes the Supreme Court were an AI chatbot, implying dissatisfaction with the court's human judgment on this issue. Overall, the author seems to imply that while the court believes affirmative action is outdated, there may be ongoing consequences for diversity in academia and broader society that the court's decision fails to address."	0.03286	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The provided summary does not directly address the author's stance on affirmative action. It focuses on the Supreme Court's decision in the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis, which is about a web designer's refusal to provide services for same-sex weddings due to religious beliefs. The text discusses concerns about the erosion of anti-discrimination protections and the potential misuse of religious freedom and free speech to justify discrimination. While the text implies a concern for equality and justice, particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals, it does not offer explicit insights into the author's views on affirmative action specifically. Therefore, based on the provided summary alone, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The provided text consists of a series of opinions from different individuals expressing their views on the Supreme Court's decision in the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis. This case involves a web designer who refused to provide services for same-sex weddings, citing religious beliefs. The overarching theme is a concern for the erosion of anti-discrimination protections and the potential for religious freedom and free speech to be used as a shield for discrimination. Michael D. Schattman humorously suggests that the Supreme Court has been pranked into considering a hypothetical scenario. Kathy Viney criticizes the use of religious beliefs to justify discrimination, drawing a parallel with apartheid in South Africa. Ravin Bhatia expresses fear for the future rights of LGBTQ+ individuals following the Court's decision. Aimée La Fountain is astounded by the case reaching the Supreme Court based on a hypothetical scenario and suggests potential legal consequences for misrepresentation. David Dorsen points out the complexity of the issue and the potential for rights to be used in different ways, depending on the context.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context of the Supreme Court's recent decisions, which the text suggests include the ""gutting of affirmative action."" This indicates a view that the Court has negatively impacted affirmative action policies, which are designed to support members of historically marginalized groups in areas such as education and employment. The tone of the text suggests that the author and other commentators view the Court's actions as a step backward in terms of achieving equality and justice for all, particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals and potentially other minority groups affected by affirmative action policies. The concern is that the Court's rulings are enabling discrimination rather than preventing it."	0.02678	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Ibert Schultz, shows a clear concern for the challenges faced by Black students in gaining access to higher education and the negative impact of banning affirmative action. Schultz's work with Black College Success and his emphasis on the importance of personalized support indicate a strong belief in proactive measures to address educational disparities. His critical view of 'colorblind' admissions and the reference to the decline in Black student enrollment following Proposition 209 suggest that he sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to ensure equal opportunities and a diverse educational environment. Therefore, Schultz appears to be strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to ban affirmative action on college admissions, with a focus on California's experience since the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which led to a significant drop in Black student enrollment in state colleges and universities. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit that helps Black students in South Los Angeles access higher education. Schultz describes the challenges faced by these students, many of whom are from low-income families and would be the first in their families to attend college. Despite these challenges, the organization has successfully helped students gain admission to various colleges and universities. Schultz emphasizes the importance of personalized support for students, including academic planning, mentoring, and college application assistance. He expresses concern that the move toward ""colorblind"" admissions will reduce opportunities for Black students and negatively affect society as a whole.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ibert Schultz, holds a critical view of the move toward ""colorblind"" college admissions and the ban on affirmative action. Schultz believes that affirmative action is necessary to address the systemic disadvantages and barriers faced by Black students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. He points to the negative consequences of Proposition 209 in California, which led to a significant decrease in Black student enrollment in state colleges and universities. Schultz argues that without considering the unique experiences and challenges of Black applicants, colleges and universities will fail to provide equal opportunities, and society will lose out on the potential contributions of these students. He implies that affirmative action helps level the playing field and is essential for achieving a more equitable and diverse educational environment."	0.029109999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author mentions affirmative action as part of a list of Colin Powell's political stances, indicating that Powell supports it 'to some degree'. However, the author does not provide their own opinion on the matter, focusing instead on how Powell's moderate stances, including his position on affirmative action, might affect his potential candidacy. The text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as it focuses more on Powell's political positioning rather than the author's perspective on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the lack of enthusiasm among American voters for the potential presidential nominees from the major parties, attributing this sentiment to both the candidates' personalities and a broader dissatisfaction with the political system. The author introduces retired General Colin Powell as a potential candidate who stands out due to his charisma, leadership qualities, and moderate political views. Powell supports adoption over abortion, gun control, some affirmative action, and opposes mandatory prayer in schools but is open to moments of silence. His position places him in the political middle, which may not be advantageous for securing a nomination from the Republican Party. The text also suggests that despite the challenges of running without a party's backing, Powell's candidacy could be viable due to public desire for an alternative choice and his strong character.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions Colin Powell's stance on affirmative action, noting that he supports it to some degree. The author does not elaborate on their personal perspective on affirmative action but presents it as one of several policy positions that contribute to Powell's moderate and potentially appealing political profile to the electorate. The inclusion of this policy stance in the context of Powell's broader appeal suggests that the author views affirmative action as one element of a centrist approach to governance."	0.02101	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be negative based on the context in which it is mentioned. The author groups affirmative action with Proposition 187, an anti-immigration measure, and describes the political climate as having a 'vigilante mood.' This suggests that the author views affirmative action as part of a regressive and discriminatory set of policies. The author's personal experiences with racism and his celebration of California's diversity further imply that he sees affirmative action as contrary to the state's heritage of integration and progress for people of Mexican descent.	"Summary:
The text discusses the significance of Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican holiday that commemorates a victory over the French army in 1862. While the holiday has become a commercialized celebration in the United States, the author reflects on the irony of celebrating a Mexican holiday in light of California's political climate, including anti-immigration Proposition 187 and anti-affirmative action initiatives. The author, who moved from Texas to California, contrasts his experiences in both states, noting overt racism in Texas compared to the subtler forms he encountered in California. Despite feeling a resurgence of discrimination similar to that in Texas due to the recent propositions, the author expresses a strong attachment to California. He reminisces about the allure of California in the past, its impact on culture, and the influence of various leaders and activists of Mexican descent who have shaped the state. The author concludes by affirming his identity as a Californian and celebrating the state's diverse heritage with a ""Viva el Cinco de Mayo!""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action negatively, as evidenced by his lumping it together with the anti-immigration Proposition 187 as part of California's current ""vigilante mood."" He implies that these initiatives are a step backward, reminiscent of the overt racism he experienced in Texas. The mention of these political measures alongside his personal experiences suggests that the author sees affirmative action as regressive and discriminatory, undermining the progress and integration of people of Mexican descent into Californian society. The text conveys a sense of disappointment and frustration with the political direction California is taking, contrasting with the author's deep affection for the state and its rich cultural history."	0.02961	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the UC Board of Regents' decision to eliminate affirmative action, indicating that the decision was politically motivated rather than based on educational merit. The author shows sympathy for Richard C. Atkinson's efforts to maintain some form of affirmative action based on socioeconomic criteria, and highlights the negative consequences that the elimination of affirmative action could have on the university and its students. The emphasis on the need for leadership to guide the university forward suggests the author believes in the value of affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's perspective can be categorized as somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political turmoil within the University of California (UC) system, related to the issue of affirmative action. In July, the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate racial and gender preferences in admissions and hiring, which was widely criticized as a politically motivated move to support Governor Pete Wilson's presidential campaign. The decision faced opposition from chancellors, student governments, and activists. The newly appointed UC President, Richard C. Atkinson, delayed the implementation of the new policy, suggesting an alternative based on socioeconomic criteria. This led to a conflict with the regents, particularly Ward Connerly, who accused Atkinson of overstepping his authority. After threats of a performance review, Atkinson apologized and agreed to accelerate the policy implementation. The author reflects on the political dynamics and the potential impact on students and the university's future, emphasizing the need for leadership to guide the university forward.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears critical of the UC Board of Regents' decision to eliminate affirmative action, suggesting that it was influenced by political ambitions rather than educational considerations. The author implies that the regents, particularly those aligned with Governor Wilson, used their authority to push a political agenda. Conversely, the author seems to sympathize with Richard C. Atkinson's stance in support of affirmative action and his attempts to introduce alternative guidelines based on socioeconomic status. The text also indicates that the political struggle over affirmative action and its implementation could have negative consequences for the university and its students. The author calls for leaders who can move the university forward, rather than getting caught up in political disputes. Overall, the author's perspective seems to favor affirmative action policies and criticizes their politicization within the UC system."	0.03031	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text displays a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging the historical necessity of the program while also critiquing its effectiveness and potential unfairness. The author is concerned that affirmative action may not address deeper economic disparities and may not benefit the most disadvantaged within minority groups. They also recognize the program's limitations and call for a more balanced debate, suggesting the establishment of a commission to review affirmative action. This stance indicates an awareness of the complexities of the issue and a desire for a more equitable distribution of opportunities without fully endorsing or rejecting affirmative action as a policy.	"Summary:
The text critically examines affirmative action, a program aimed at promoting equality by redistributing opportunities among various racial, ethnic, and gender groups. The author argues that affirmative action does not address the income disparities between the top earners and the rest but rather reassigns the existing opportunities without expanding them. The program is contrasted with traditional redistributive efforts, which are based on financial aid and can be adjusted more easily than affirmative action, which deals with finite resources like jobs or college spots. The author notes that affirmative action categorizes people by fixed identities (race, gender) rather than by their conditions (unemployment, poverty), which can change over time. The text also acknowledges the complexity of the issue, including the historical context of racial discrimination in the U.S. and the potential negative consequences of abruptly ending affirmative action. It suggests that both opponents and supporters of the program need to acknowledge its limitations and the broader context of equality of opportunity. The possibility of a commission to review affirmative action is mentioned, with the hope that it will contribute to a more nuanced debate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action, recognizing its intent to promote inclusion and equality but also questioning its effectiveness and fairness. The author is concerned that affirmative action may not adequately address the root causes of inequality, such as the disparities in opportunity between the wealthy and the poor, and may inadvertently disadvantage individuals from modest backgrounds who do not belong to the targeted affirmative action groups.

The author acknowledges the historical significance of racial discrimination in the United States and the need for African Americans to have opportunities for inclusion at all societal levels. However, the author also points out that affirmative action may not be helping the most disadvantaged within minority communities and may raise concerns among white individuals from modest backgrounds about their children's prospects.

The author calls for a balanced debate on affirmative action, where both sides recognize each other's valid points. Opponents should understand that achieving true equality of opportunity requires significant interventions, while supporters should recognize the program's limitations and the legitimate concerns of those who feel they may be unfairly impacted by it. The author suggests that a commission on affirmative action could be beneficial if it focuses on how to ensure a more equitable distribution of opportunities for all, rather than delivering a prescriptive moral judgment."	0.0351	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author presents a balanced view of affirmative action, recognizing its importance for diversity and racial justice while also considering the negative aspects such as 'racial strife' and the perception of unfair advantage. The author admires the commitment to diversity but criticizes the approach of meeting numerical goals and suggests focusing on nondiscrimination and quality. This indicates that the author is in favor of the principles behind affirmative action but critical of some of its implementations, demonstrating a nuanced, somewhat in favor stance.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding The Washington Post's affirmative action policies, which were criticized in an article by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic. Shalit accused The Post of lowering its standards to meet affirmative action goals, causing ""racial strife,"" and not always allowing the best candidates to win positions. The Post's editor, Leonard Downie Jr., and publisher, Donald E. Graham, strongly refuted these claims, defending the paper's commitment to diversity without compromising quality. The author acknowledges the complexities of affirmative action, especially in an economically insecure time, and the mixed feelings it generates among different groups. While the author admires The Post's efforts toward a diversified staff, they suggest that the focus should be on producing a better newspaper rather than meeting numerical goals, advocating for absolute nondiscrimination instead.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. They recognize that affirmative action has led to ""racial strife"" and emotional impact, particularly among white males who feel disadvantaged by such policies. The author also acknowledges the economic challenges and contraction of the newspaper industry, implying that affirmative action may be harder to justify in times of economic insecurity.

Despite these concerns, the author admires The Post's commitment to diversity and racial justice and seems to believe in the importance of a diversified staff. They are critical of using unattributed quotes to charge that incompetent individuals were hired because of their race, which they believe unfairly tarnishes the reputation of black journalists.

Ultimately, the author suggests that the goal of affirmative action should not be to meet specific numerical targets, but rather to ensure absolute nondiscrimination and focus on the quality of the newspaper's output. They seem to advocate for a balance between diversity and maintaining high standards, without resorting to quotas or lowering hiring standards."	0.02907	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author presents a critical view of affirmative action, focusing on its negative impact on white men. By highlighting that one in ten white men are adversely affected, discussing the zero-sum nature of job competition, and pointing out instances of perceived reverse discrimination, the author indicates a concern for the policy's fairness and implementation. The emphasis on the lack of political response to the grievances of white men and the call to acknowledge legitimate criticisms without dismissing them as racist suggests that the author believes affirmative action has been misapplied. The use of terms like 'reverse discrimination' and the concern over a 'racial spoils system' further underscore a negative stance towards current affirmative action practices.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action on white men, suggesting that approximately one in ten white men have been negatively affected by such policies. It describes the competitive job market conditions during which affirmative action was implemented, leading to zero-sum outcomes where gains for some meant losses for others. The author's research, based on interviews and anecdotal evidence, indicates that public-sector white men under 45 with people-oriented skills have been most vulnerable to reverse discrimination. Instances of white men losing opportunities or facing career disruptions are presented, with many feeling unable to complain for fear of being labeled racist. The text also criticizes the lack of political response to the grievances of white men, with liberals and conservatives alike dismissing their concerns. The author argues for the need to acknowledge the legitimate criticisms of affirmative action without dismissing them as racist.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Lynch, views affirmative action critically, particularly its implementation and impact on white men. He perceives affirmative action as having evolved into a system that unfairly disadvantages certain groups, especially white males in specific sectors and age ranges. Lynch argues that affirmative action has been practiced in a way that goes beyond the original intent of creating fair opportunities, turning into a ""racial spoils system"" that he believes is corrupt and has led to reverse discrimination. He suggests that the grievances of white men have been largely ignored or suppressed by both political parties, academia, and the media, leading to frustration and cynicism among those affected. Lynch believes that the negative experiences of white men with affirmative action should be openly discussed and addressed rather than dismissed as mere racism, implying that the policies in place may be flawed and require reevaluation."	0.03926	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Clint Bolick, is presented as critical of affirmative action policies, particularly those that involve racial quotas and preferences. Bolick suggests these policies do not effectively address the core issues faced by the black community, such as crime, economic stagnation, and inadequate education. Instead, he advocates for empowerment strategies, such as school choice and economic opportunities, which he believes could better connect conservatives with mainstream black Americans. The author's perspective points to a belief that affirmative action, in its current form supported by civil rights leadership, is out of touch with the needs and views of the wider black community. The emphasis on ability over race in hiring and education decisions further indicates his opposition to affirmative action policies that prioritize racial considerations.	"Summary:
The text discusses the racial polarization in the United States, challenging the myth that black and white Americans have fundamentally different views and aspirations. It cites a survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies which shows that most black Americans share common aspirations with other Americans, such as safe streets, good schools, and home ownership. The survey also indicates that a significant number of black Americans identify as conservative and are more conservative than the politicians and organizations claiming to represent them. Despite this, very few black Americans are Republicans, suggesting a disconnect between the party and black conservatives.

The survey highlights areas of agreement between black and white Americans on issues like capital punishment, education, and welfare. It also shows a discrepancy between the views of black leadership and the wider black community, particularly on issues like affirmative action, busing for integration, and the death penalty.

The author, Clint Bolick, argues that civil rights groups are out of touch with the black community by focusing on social engineering schemes such as racial quotas, which do not address the real problems of crime, economic stagnation, and inadequate education. Bolick suggests that conservatives have an opportunity to connect with mainstream black Americans by concentrating on empowerment issues like school choice and economic opportunities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Clint Bolick appears to be critical of affirmative action, particularly as it is supported by what he describes as the ""civil rights leadership elite."" He suggests that affirmative action, as a form of social engineering that emphasizes racial preferences, is not addressing the actual needs of the black underclass, such as crime, economic stagnation, and inadequate schools. Bolick also points out that there is a significant portion of the black community that believes ability should be the determining factor in hiring and education decisions rather than race, contradicting the stance of some black leaders. He advocates for a focus on empowerment and opportunity rather than what he perceives as a divisive and counterproductive racial spoils system."	0.03669	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective is critical of affirmative action policies that involve quotas, emphasizing a preference for a colorblind Constitution and individual merit. The author appreciates Clarence Thomas's approach to equality, which is based on natural rights and the original intent of the Constitution, rather than race-based remedies. This indicates that the author is against affirmative action policies that deviate from the constitutional text and original intent, particularly those that mandate specific racial outcomes.	"Summary:
The NAACP is considering whether to oppose the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, expressing a preference for a justice like Thurgood Marshall. However, the author argues that Thomas's views on equality and the Constitution align closely with those of Marshall, particularly regarding the landmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education. Both men criticized the reasoning behind the Brown decision, which relied on sociological studies rather than constitutional text and original intent. They both referenced the Declaration of Independence and the Fourteenth Amendment, advocating for a colorblind Constitution and equality under the law. The author suggests that Thomas's critics misunderstand his use of natural rights and original-intent jurisprudence, which is aimed at ensuring individual liberty and equality without resorting to quotas. The NAACP's Benjamin Hooks acknowledges some of Thomas's valid points, particularly his commitment to individual justice. The author posits that the NAACP faces a choice to either align with its traditional liberal allies or recognize the similarities between Thomas and Marshall on key civil rights issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action policies, particularly quotas, and suggests that these policies lead to ""petty squabbling."" The author views Clarence Thomas as an advocate for a colorblind Constitution and a proponent of equality based on individual merit rather than race-based remedies. The author implies that Thomas's approach to equality is rooted in the original intent of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, which emphasize natural rights and individual liberty. This perspective suggests that the author values a judicial approach that seeks to eliminate discrimination without mandating specific racial or group-based outcomes, such as quotas, which the author associates with judicial activism and a departure from constitutional text and original intent."	0.0291	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of affirmative action, particularly the use of quotas and the division it causes, suggests a stance that is somewhat against the current implementation of affirmative action policies. The author acknowledges the original intent of affirmative action to level the playing field but criticizes its evolution into a system that distributes benefits based on race or sex. The support for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which seeks to outlaw quotas, further indicates a belief that affirmative action should be reformed to focus on individual achievement rather than race-based preferences.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political efforts in California to reform affirmative action policies, particularly in relation to university admissions. There are three main arenas where these efforts are taking place: the University of California system, the state legislature, and through a proposed initiative process. Ward Connerly, a University of California regent, has been vocal in his opposition to race-based admissions and preferences, advocating for alternatives that focus on marketing the university to underrepresented groups and assisting them in preparing for applications. He has faced opposition from those who defend quotas and has called for more courage from his fellow regents. There is also mention of the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment to outlaw quotas, which is facing challenges in terms of funding and opposition from businesses that benefit from quotas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears critical of affirmative action as it is currently implemented, particularly the use of quotas and institutional mandates. The author suggests that affirmative action has strayed from its original purpose of helping individuals compete on a level playing field and has become a source of division and bitterness among students. The author points out the opposition from white and Asian-heritage students who feel that merit alone is not sufficient for admission due to affirmative action policies. The text also implies that affirmative action policies may be causing harm to the Democratic Party and society as a whole by creating a racial wedge.

The author seems to support the idea of affirmative action as a means to assist those who need help in competing, but not in its present form, which emphasizes quotas and preferences. The California Civil Rights Initiative is portrayed as a corrective measure that aims to return the focus of affirmative action to individual achievement rather than institutional mandates. The author's perspective is that affirmative action should be reclaimed and reoriented to its original intent, which was to create equal opportunities rather than distribute benefits based on race or sex."	0.02893	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of William Weld's stance on affirmative action, indicating a negative view of Weld's approach. The criticism is focused on Weld's endorsement of the status quo and the implication that his shift to the left on this issue was influenced by personal connections rather than policy principles. The author also highlights the resentment felt by those negatively affected by affirmative action policies, suggesting that Weld dismissed their concerns. The use of phrases like 'betrayed the trust' and the warning about 'new-age fusion Republicanism' suggest a stance that is at least somewhat against affirmative action, as it is critical of Weld's support for these policies.	"Summary:
William Weld rose to prominence as the Governor of Massachusetts, winning over conservative Democrats known as ""Weldocrats"" with his blend of fiscal conservatism and social libertarianism. Initially, he was successful in implementing reforms like cutting state jobs and privatizing services. However, after his re-election, Weld began to alienate his supporters by taking stances that seemed to favor special interests over populist concerns. This included backing an unpopular pay raise for state legislators, supporting costly mandates for off-duty police oversight of road work, and failing to push for supply-side tax cuts or a death penalty bill despite public support.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly of Weld's endorsement of the status quo. Weld's speech at Northeastern University, where he compared affirmative action to taxation and defense-procurement systems as necessary, disappointed many of his supporters. The author suggests that Weld's shift to the left on affirmative action was influenced by his friendship with Flash Wiley, an African-American businessman and Democratic activist. Weld dismissed the resentment of white males affected by affirmative action policies, citing the higher unemployment rate among blacks as a justification for these policies. The author implies that Weld's approach to affirmative action and other issues has betrayed the trust of the Weldocrats, warning voters about the reliability of ""new-age fusion Republicanism."""	0.03317	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not directly address affirmative action, focusing instead on economic strategies that could benefit the black community, such as a capital gains tax cut. The text implies that such economic measures might make affirmative action less necessary by empowering black businesses and creating jobs. However, since the author does not explicitly express support for or opposition to affirmative action, but rather discusses alternative economic approaches, it is best to categorize the author as 'neutral' on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text advocates for the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to support a capital gains tax cut, arguing that it will benefit the black community by stimulating economic growth and job creation. The author suggests that reducing capital gains taxes will free up capital for investments, particularly in black-controlled companies, which could lead to job opportunities for middle- and working-class individuals, including those transitioning off welfare. The text points out that venture capital, which would increase with such a tax cut, has a track record of job creation. It also highlights the disparity in capital flow to black firms and suggests government initiatives to address this issue. The author believes that a capital gains tax cut could replace other incentives and form a strategic alliance between the CBC and the Republican Congress, enhancing the CBC's political influence.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that economic policies that facilitate investment in black-owned businesses could eventually make affirmative action unnecessary. They suggest that by increasing the flow of venture capital to black-controlled companies, job creation within the black community would naturally increase, potentially reducing the need for affirmative action policies. The author implies that affirmative action is a temporary measure that could be replaced by more sustainable economic growth and investment strategies, which would empower black entrepreneurs and create jobs within the community."	0.023410000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of Alexis Herman's nomination and their use of terms like 'quota-mongering' indicate a negative view of affirmative action practices, especially those that resemble quotas. The author's concern about the influence of affirmative action in the Labor Department under Herman's potential leadership suggests a belief that such practices could be improperly implemented. The text does not support affirmative action as executed by the Democratic Party, and the author seems to favor a more cautious and moderate approach. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'somewhat against' affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text critiques President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman for Labor Secretary, questioning the White House's decision amidst a campaign-contributions controversy. The author points out that Herman, previously the director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, was involved in creating a memo for enhancing outreach to the African-American community, which included a chart that the author views as evidence of quota-based affirmative action practices. The text suggests that the Democratic Party is heavily influenced by its constituent factions, including women, labor, and minority groups, and that this influence is at odds with moderate public statements. The author expresses concern that Herman's approach to affirmative action, as evidenced by her past work, will carry over into her role as Labor Secretary, where she would have significant influence over affirmative action practices in corporations through the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, particularly quota-based approaches. They use the term ""quota-mongering"" to describe what they see as the improper use of quotas in Democratic Party practices and imply that such practices are not aligned with the moderate image the party projects to the public. The author is concerned that affirmative action, under the guidance of someone like Alexis Herman, would lead to mandatory quotas for corporations, as exemplified by the reference to the Texaco case. The author argues for the need for a Labor Secretary with great judgment and sensitivity, implicitly suggesting that Herman's approach to affirmative action lacks these qualities. Overall, the author's perspective seems to be that affirmative action, especially when it involves specific quotas, is problematic and should be approached with caution and moderation."	0.024770000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text seems to critique the current implementation of affirmative action, citing examples such as the CCRI and the Astroline Communications Company case to illustrate the system's flaws. The author's call for 'useful distinctions' and a more nuanced approach to the debate indicates a desire for reform rather than outright opposition or support. The perspective is critical of the extremes in the debate and suggests a shift toward a more moderate, thoughtful discussion. The author's stance is not outright against affirmative action but suggests skepticism about its current form and implementation, indicating a somewhat against position.	"Summary:
The text discusses the polarized nature of debates around affirmative action, using the example of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) and the formation of the American Civil Rights Institute to argue against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides. The author notes that the passage of CCRI, with significant minority support, suggests a public mood shift. The text also touches on a legal case involving Astroline Communications Company, which benefited from the FCC's minority distress sale policy but was later found to have questionable minority ownership stakes. The Supreme Court's shift from supporting racial preferences to a color-blind policy in Adarand Constructors v. Pena is also mentioned. The author argues for a return to ""useful distinctions"" in public discourse, as the all-or-nothing approach lacks credibility and fails to acknowledge the complexities of affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of the all-or-nothing approach that proponents and opponents often take. The author suggests that the debate around affirmative action has become too polarized, with discussions immediately escalating to extreme comparisons (e.g., comparing the Gingrich tax-exempt affair to Watergate) rather than focusing on the nuanced details of each case. The author points to the public's support for initiatives like CCRI and the problems with the implementation of set-asides, as evidenced by the Astroline case, to argue that the current system of affirmative action is flawed and that there is a need for more nuanced, balanced discussions. The author believes that affirmative action proponents should be open to discussing the system's shortcomings and that a more nuanced approach would be more credible and constructive."	0.027179999999999996	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to advocate for a balanced approach to affirmative action, recognizing both its necessity in addressing historical discrimination and the concerns associated with its implementation when perceived as quotas. The mention of the U.S. Military and West Point as successful examples of affirmative action implies a belief in the positive outcomes of such programs. However, the emphasis on a nuanced discussion and the inclusion of conservative perspectives suggest that the author's support is not unconditional but rather measured and mindful of the complexities involved.	"Summary:
President Clinton's initiative on race has faced early challenges, including political missteps by key figures and a lack of focus. Despite this, the effort is seen as commendable due to the complexity and historical difficulty of addressing racial issues in America. The initiative is being adjusted to include more diverse perspectives, including conservative ones. Affirmative action is a contentious aspect of the discussion, with public opinion divided based on how affirmative action is framed—either as quotas or as a means to ensure equal opportunity. Recent votes in California and Houston reflect this division. The article cites the U.S. Military and West Point as examples of successful integration through affirmative action and cautions against the complete elimination of such programs. General Colin Powell's nuanced view on affirmative action is highlighted, emphasizing the need for temporary measures to address past discrimination while avoiding inflammatory rhetoric that hinders dialogue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be cautiously supportive. They acknowledge the public's opposition to affirmative action when it is seen as quotas or rigid preferences but note the general support for it as a means to foster equal opportunities. The author points out that affirmative action has historically played a role in integrating institutions like the U.S. Military and suggests that there is a need for such programs to address inequalities. They also highlight the importance of nuanced discussions around the topic, as exemplified by Colin Powell's stance, which recognizes the need for temporary measures to correct historical discrimination while also acknowledging the potential drawbacks of preferential treatment. The author seems to advocate for a balanced approach that avoids extreme positions and encourages open dialogue on the issue."	0.03063	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses a critical view of affirmative action, highlighting the stress it creates within organizations and the potential for hiring based on quotas rather than merit. By discussing the tapes and the misinterpretation of the term 'black jelly bean,' the author seems to suggest that affirmative action policies can lead to misunderstandings and a focus on diversity that may detract from a company's core business objectives. The author's mention of Lundwall's preference for recruiting from schools where students advance on merit and the reference to California voters opposing racial preferences further support the notion that the author is skeptical of affirmative action policies that prioritize diversity over merit. Additionally, the author's comment on human dignity and the importance of not being overly sensitive to diversity issues implies a belief that affirmative action may be an overcorrection. Overall, the author's perspective leans towards a criticism of affirmative action, although not an outright rejection of its principles.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the controversy surrounding Texaco and the alleged use of a racial slur by its former treasurer, Robert Ulrich. Initially, the author was prepared to criticize the media for misinterpreting the term ""black jelly bean"" as racist and for assuming that Ulrich used the ""n"" word on the tapes, which were of poor quality. However, after Texaco enhanced the audio, it was revealed that the word in question was ""Nicholas,"" and ""jelly bean"" was an internal metaphor for diversity. The tapes were recorded by Richard Lundwall, a manager who was later dismissed, and they captured casual office conversations, including discussions on downsizing and affirmative action.

The author criticizes journalists for their lack of depth in reporting and their eagerness to sensationalize the story without fully understanding the context. The tapes also revealed the company's struggle to balance downsizing with increasing minority and female representation, and the stress associated with racial issues within the organization. Despite the initial misinterpretation, the tapes showed Ulrich in a positive light regarding his views on the advancement of women and minorities. Texaco's response to the situation is described as cautious, reflecting the complexities of managing diversity and the pressures of public perception.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to hold a critical view of affirmative action, suggesting that it creates stress within organizations and implies that it may lead to hiring based on quotas rather than merit. The author cites a conversation from the tapes where Lundwall suggests recruiting from predominantly black schools where students advance on scholastic merit, contrasting it with other MBA programs that are under pressure to promote by quota. The author also references the broader societal debate on affirmative action, noting that California voters, while supporting Bill Clinton, also opposed racial preferences. The author suggests that there is more to human dignity than being overly sensitive to diversity issues and that maintaining a focus on the core business, such as finding oil in Texaco's case, should not be overshadowed by the push for diversity."	0.03863	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of the ABA's involvement in affirmative action suggests a disapproval of the ABA's stance on the issue. However, there is no detailed argument or evidence provided specifically against affirmative action, but rather a broader disapproval of the ABA's liberal agenda. The author's specific stance on affirmative action is therefore somewhat inferred from the context rather than explicitly stated. Given the lack of a detailed argument against affirmative action itself and the focus on the ABA's involvement as part of a larger critique, the author's stance is categorized as 'somewhat against.'	"Summary:
The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for what the author perceives as its liberal bias and anti-business agenda. The ABA has been involved in supporting controversial issues such as abortion rights, affirmative action, and calling for a death penalty moratorium. The author also highlights the ABA's stance on class actions, tort reform, and government mandates on businesses, arguing that the ABA's policies favor plaintiffs' lawyers at the expense of American companies. The ABA's lobbying efforts against Republican civil justice reform are mentioned, along with the organization's role in advising on judicial nominations. The author questions the ABA's impartiality and suggests that its positions may be influenced by a desire to protect lawyers' financial interests. The text also criticizes the ABA for refusing to limit contingency fees and for denying an increase in personal injury suits, accusing the organization of selective evidence use.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text views the ABA's endorsement of affirmative action as part of its broader liberal agenda, which they criticize. The author implies that the ABA's involvement in non-legal matters such as affirmative action is inappropriate for a legal organization. The specific stance on affirmative action is not elaborated upon, but it is clear that the author disapproves of the ABA's support for it, considering it as evidence of the ABA's departure from its core mission and responsibilities."	0.0273	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated but can be inferred from the critique of the media's handling of the issue. The author suggests that the media is biased towards liberal viewpoints, considering them the norm, and does not adequately represent conservative perspectives on issues like affirmative action. This implies that the author may have concerns about the media's portrayal of affirmative action and may be critical of the policy. However, without a clear statement from the author on their stance towards affirmative action itself, it is not possible to accurately categorize their position on the policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not explicitly determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The author discusses Dan Rather's recent appearances in the media, promoting his book and refuting claims of having a left-wing bias. The argument extends to other prominent news figures like Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw, who also deny a liberal slant in their reporting. However, the author points out that polls indicate a significant perception of liberal bias among both Republicans and Democrats. The author suggests that these media personalities either deny the bias knowingly or are genuinely unaware of their own liberal leanings. The article argues that liberal bias is not just about partisan attacks but also about a worldview that sees liberal opinions as the norm and conservative ones as outliers needing identification. The author criticizes the media for uncritically promoting liberal positions and being insulated from conservative perspectives, which he believes contributes to a skewed representation of issues like affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is implied rather than explicitly stated. He criticizes the media for not being as comfortable with groups that oppose affirmative action as they are with liberal activists. This suggests that the author believes the media portrays affirmative action and other liberal social issues as the default, reasonable stance, without giving fair consideration to opposing viewpoints. The author implies that this lack of balance in reporting is indicative of a broader liberal bias within the media."	0.02853	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its historical significance and the need for measures to address racial inequality. However, they also express concerns about the potential for affirmative action to lead to negative consequences such as tokenism and stigmatization. They seem to advocate for a more nuanced approach to diversity in the workplace, which they refer to as 'diversity management.' This approach aims to be fair to minorities while ensuring fairness to others. The author's skepticism about the motives of those involved in lawsuits against companies like Coca-Cola and their defense of the companies' historical civil rights efforts further suggest a belief in the complexity of the issue rather than a straightforward endorsement or rejection of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the complexities surrounding a racial bias lawsuit against Coca-Cola and the broader issue of affirmative action. The author criticizes the media's portrayal of Coca-Cola, suggesting that journalists have become less cautious in their reporting on the company due to its recent public relations struggles. The author defends Coca-Cola's historical efforts to support civil rights and integrate its workforce, arguing that it's unfair to blame the company for the racist behavior of independent Southern bottlers. The text also mentions a previous case involving Texaco, where a transcript was leaked that falsely accused an executive of making a racist comment. The author expresses skepticism about the motives of the lawyer in the Coke case, Cyrus Mehri, and challenges the notion that any corporate attention to racial matters is evidence of racism.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as a well-intentioned but sometimes flawed approach to addressing racial inequality in the workplace. They acknowledge that historical practices have led to the clustering of black employees in certain departments and that affirmative action has led to some unintended consequences, such as tokenism and stigmatization. The author points out that companies have learned from these experiences and are now focusing on ""diversity management,"" which aims to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others. The author also suggests that true integration requires more than just hiring diverse candidates; it involves creating an environment where all employees can succeed, which can be hindered by corporate downsizing and restructuring. The text implies that the author believes in the importance of addressing diversity in a nuanced and thoughtful way, rather than through simplistic or heavy-handed measures."	0.03236	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's stance on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text, as the text is a work of fiction with a satirical tone. The use of the term 'affirmative action' in the context of a fictional scenario where it is associated with concessions to a violent group does not clearly reflect the author's views on affirmative action as a policy in the real world. The term appears to be used more as a narrative device to comment on the appeasement of violent groups rather than as a commentary on the policy itself. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based solely on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text is a hypothetical thriller plot set in an alternate reality where a militant group called the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) seeks to reclaim Texas for Mexico. Despite the violence and terrorism employed by the HRA, including bombings and assassinations, the American public appears indifferent. The U.S. president, named Bartlet in the story, engages in a peace process that results in numerous concessions to the HRA, such as releasing imprisoned HRA members, allowing them to hold government positions, and reducing the presence of law enforcement. The narrative draws a parallel to the British government's handling of the situation in Northern Ireland, suggesting that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has made similar concessions to terrorists for short-term gains, setting a dangerous precedent.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Lionel Shriver, uses the term ""affirmative action"" in a sarcastic manner within the context of the fictional scenario. The Latinos in Texas, despite not supporting the HRA, are portrayed as indifferent to the affirmative action they receive due to the chaos caused by the HRA. This suggests that the author may view affirmative action in a negative light, at least in the context of the story, as something that can be exploited or become a side effect of violence and unrest, rather than a positive or constructive policy. However, since the text is a work of fiction with a satirical tone, it is important to note that the author's direct views on affirmative action as a policy in reality are not explicitly stated in the text. The reference to affirmative action seems to be more of a narrative device to critique the appeasement of violent groups and the unintended consequences of such actions, rather than a straightforward commentary on affirmative action itself."	0.03487	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's approach, particularly her use of race-based affirmative action as a debate point. The author describes Townsend's stance as 'demagoguery' and implies that her tactics may alienate white voters and are not effectively appealing to a broader electorate. While the author does not explicitly state their own stance on affirmative action, the criticism of Townsend's approach suggests a skepticism about the way affirmative action is being presented or used politically. However, without a clear endorsement or condemnation of affirmative action policies themselves, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance as strongly or somewhat against. Instead, the author seems focused on the political strategy and its implications rather than the policy itself.	"Summary:
Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend could have potentially been the Vice President if Al Gore had chosen her as his running mate instead of Senator Joseph Lieberman. Townsend, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, is currently struggling in her campaign against Republican Rep. Robert Ehrlich. She has failed to secure the large black electorate in Maryland, a typically Democratic base, and faced criticism for choosing a white, former Republican admiral as her running mate. Ehrlich, on the other hand, has chosen a black man, Michael Steele. Townsend's campaign has been criticized for negative tactics and for attempting to use her family's history with gun violence to gain political advantage. The outcome of the election may be influenced by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area and voter turnout on Election Day.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's stance on affirmative action. During a debate at Morgan State University, Townsend attacked Ehrlich's opposition to race-based affirmative action, equating historical racial injustices with the need for affirmative action to be based on race. The author describes this as demagoguery and suggests that while Townsend may have won the debate in the hall, Ehrlich won it on television, as the behavior of the NAACP and the audience may have alienated many white voters. The text implies that Townsend's approach to affirmative action and the way she framed her opponent's position might not resonate with voters and could potentially be seen as an overly simplistic characterization. The author appears to question the effectiveness of Townsend's strategy in appealing to a broader electorate."	0.033100000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion of the leaked memos and their content, specifically regarding the delay of judicial nominees to influence a case on affirmative action, indicates a critical view of the use of affirmative action in the context of judicial appointments. Moreover, the author's emphasis on the politicization of the judiciary and the manipulation of the court system to uphold affirmative action policies suggests a negative stance towards affirmative action, as it is portrayed as a means for political maneuvering rather than a policy based on ethical or legal principles.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding leaked Democratic strategy memos from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which detailed the influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic senators' decisions regarding President Bush's judicial nominees. The memos, largely ignored by mainstream media, revealed political maneuvering, particularly in the opposition to nominee Miguel Estrada and in delaying nominees to influence a case on affirmative action. A Republican staffer is accused of leaking the memos but the author argues that due to a lack of a firewall on the committee's computer system, all staffers had access to the shared drive where the memos were stored. The author criticizes the media for not focusing on the content of the memos and questions why the GOP leadership is not defending the staffer more vigorously.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action, at least in the context of the judicial appointment process. The text describes a situation where Democrats were encouraged to delay judicial nominees to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals specifically to ensure that the court would uphold the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. The author presents this as an example of politicization of the judiciary, implying a negative view of using judicial appointments to influence court decisions on affirmative action. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action is being used as a tool for political manipulation rather than being based on principled differences of opinion."	0.02855	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is limited to its mention within the context of a scandal, and there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the issue. The focus of the text is primarily on the political history of the Daley family in Chicago, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political dominance of the Daley family in Chicago, with Richard J. Daley serving as mayor from 1955 to 1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley, taking over in 1989. The author notes that despite occasional scandals and criticisms, including those related to affirmative action contracts, the Daley administration remains popular among many Chicagoans. The city has seen significant improvements, such as the transformation of skid rows into charming neighborhoods and the creation of Millennium Park. The author also touches on the reduction of racial tensions under Richard M. Daley's leadership and his lack of interest in pursuing higher political office, suggesting that his focus on Chicago has contributed to his success as mayor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions affirmative action in the context of a scandal involving contracts, suggesting that such issues are a routine part of Chicago politics. However, the main focus of the text is not on affirmative action itself but on the political landscape of Chicago and the Daley family's influence. The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action, so it is not possible to discern their stance on the policy based on the provided text."	0.02754	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Peter Berkowitz, expresses a viewpoint that is somewhat against affirmative action, specifically within the context of academic hiring in political science departments. He argues against the idea of affirmative action for conservatives, suggesting that hiring should be based on scholarly standards rather than political opinions. Berkowitz believes that the inclusion of conservative ideas in the curriculum should be based on intellectual rigor and merit, not as a form of affirmative action. His stance is that identity should not take precedence over knowledge and critical thinking in academic settings.	"Summary:
Peter Berkowitz criticizes the lack of courses on conservatism in the political science departments of top universities and colleges in the United States. He points out that while political science is divided into various subfields, conservative ideas are relevant and significant within these areas, especially American politics and political theory. However, he observes that students are unlikely to learn about the conservative tradition in American politics, which includes figures like John Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, William F. Buckley Jr., Milton Friedman, and Ronald Reagan. Berkowitz argues that the exclusion of conservative thought from the curriculum undermines a liberal education and an objective study of political science. He also refutes the idea of affirmative action for conservatives in academic hiring, emphasizing that political science departments should not lower scholarly standards or seek professors based on political opinions but rather should ensure that courses on conservative ideas are taught with intellectual rigor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Peter Berkowitz, is critical of affirmative action for conservatives within academia. He believes that political science departments should not hire professors based on their conservative political opinions or lower scholarly standards to accommodate conservative viewpoints. Berkowitz argues that doing so would perpetuate the problematic assumption that one's identity is more important than knowledge and critical thinking in teaching political ideas. He suggests that scholars, regardless of their own political leanings, can and should study and teach conservatism to understand American political history and modern political philosophy better. Berkowitz asserts that affirmative action for conservatives should be rejected, particularly by those who are conservatives themselves and by defenders of liberal education. He advocates for the inclusion of courses on conservative ideas in the curriculum based on intellectual merit, not as a form of affirmative action."	0.03038	affirmative action	txt/399053714.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to recognize the complexity of Jesse Helms's views, including his opposition to affirmative action. By suggesting that Helms had 'valid criticisms' of affirmative action, the author seems to acknowledge that there might be legitimate concerns with the policy. However, the author also notes Helms's failure to address broader social issues and his lack of clear denunciations of racism, indicating that the author believes Helms's approach to racial policies was incomplete and problematic. The author does not explicitly endorse or reject affirmative action but instead focuses on Helms's strategic influence in politics, which suggests a more neutral or balanced perspective on Helms's stance rather than on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
Jesse Helms, a staunch conservative and former U.S. Senator, passed away at the age of 86. He was known for his unwavering commitment to social conservatism, anti-Communism, and an assertive foreign policy. Although many of his views have been validated over time, his stance on racial issues and comments against gays have been criticized. Helms played a pivotal role in Ronald Reagan's political career by helping him win the North Carolina primary, which eventually led to Reagan's presidency. Despite often being outvoted in the Senate, Helms was skilled at gaining publicity for his causes and blocking appointments he opposed. He also made controversial stands, such as supporting authoritarian regimes and opposing the Martin Luther King holiday. However, Helms did change some of his positions later in life, becoming a supporter of Israel and backing AIDS funding and poverty alleviation in Africa after an interaction with Bono. Helms's techniques in campaigning and policy influence have been adopted by both conservatives and liberals alike.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Jesse Helms had valid criticisms of affirmative action and forced busing, implying that Helms's perspective was that these policies were examples of government overreach. However, the author also points out that Helms failed to pair his critiques with a call for the South's social transformation and clear denunciations of racism. This indicates that the author believes Helms's approach to affirmative action was flawed because it did not adequately address the underlying social and moral issues associated with racial inequality. The author seems to acknowledge the complexity of Helms's legacy, noting that while Helms had a blind spot on racial issues, his career also provides a strategic blueprint for political influence, regardless of one's viewpoint on affirmative action or other policies."	0.03311	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion on the effectiveness of political strategies, including affirmative action, for black progress is critical. By citing Thomas Sowell's research, the author indicates that economic success does not necessarily follow political success. The historical examples suggest that economic gains often precede political ones, and the critique of Obama's policies implies a belief that certain liberal policies may not facilitate black progress. The author's perspective is more aligned with economic independence and skill development rather than affirmative action, which the author implicitly suggests may not be the most effective means for socioeconomic advancement.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential implications of Barack Obama's presidency for African-American progress, contrasting historical strategies for black advancement. It references the divergent views of W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington on whether to focus on political integration or economic independence. Despite the increase in black elected officials since the 1960s, socioeconomic disparities persist. The author cites Thomas Sowell's research, which suggests that political success is not necessarily linked to economic prosperity, using examples of various ethnic groups whose economic success preceded political involvement. The text argues that political success, as in the case of the Irish in America, does not guarantee socioeconomic advancement. It critiques Obama's policies on minimum wage and opposition to school vouchers, suggesting they may hinder black progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Riley, appears to be skeptical of the effectiveness of affirmative action and other civil rights legislation in promoting black progress. By referencing Thomas Sowell's work, which indicates that political activity is not a primary factor in a group's rise from poverty to prosperity, the author suggests that affirmative action may not be a necessary or sufficient means to achieve economic advancement. The historical examples provided imply that economic gains often come before political gains and that political success does not necessarily lead to group achievement. The author's critique of Obama's policy positions further indicates a belief that certain liberal policies, which may be associated with affirmative action principles (such as minimum wage laws and opposition to school vouchers), could maintain obstacles to black progress rather than remove them. Overall, the author's perspective seems to favor economic independence and skill development over political strategies like affirmative action for advancing the socioeconomic status of African-Americans."	0.03008	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, expresses a critical view of affirmative action, particularly highlighting the negative consequences of what she perceives as overzealous and ideologically driven applications of such policies. She uses the incident at IUPUI as a case study to illustrate her point that affirmative action can lead to unjust accusations and suppress freedom of expression. Rabinowitz's skepticism and disapproval, as well as her connection of this mindset to broader political discourse, indicate a stance that is critical of the current implementation of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text recounts an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) where a student employee, Keith Sampson, faced accusations of racial harassment for reading a book about the Ku Klux Klan's history during his work breaks. Initially, Sampson was told by his union representative and an affirmative action officer that bringing the book to the campus was inappropriate, equating it with bringing pornography to work. Despite Sampson pointing out the book's scholarly nature and availability in the university library, he was formally accused of racial harassment by the chief affirmative action officer, Lillian Charleston. After Sampson sought help from the ACLU and received local press coverage, the university changed its stance, and the affirmative action officer sent a new letter stating it was permissible for Sampson to read scholarly materials during break time, without mentioning the previous accusations. The university's media relations struggled to explain the situation, and eventually, the University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz expressed regret over the affair.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, presents a critical perspective on affirmative action and the hypersensitivity surrounding race on college campuses. She uses the incident at IUPUI to illustrate what she considers the absurdity and overreach of campus affirmative action policies, suggesting that they can lead to unjust accusations and suppress freedom of expression. Rabinowitz connects this hypersensitivity to the broader political climate, particularly during the presidential election campaign, where she claims there is a readiness to impute racism to criticisms of Barack Obama. She implies that the mindset behind the overzealous application of affirmative action is not confined to universities but is also present in political discourse. The author's tone is one of skepticism and disapproval of what she sees as ideologically driven overreactions and a lack of common sense in the application of affirmative action policies."	0.03722	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The text focuses on the political influence of nonprofit foundations and their role in shaping public policy and discourse, including issues like affirmative action. While the author mentions foundations' influence over organizations like MALDEF, which is involved in affirmative action debates, the text does not delve into the author's personal stance on affirmative action. Therefore, based on the summary provided, we cannot accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the influence and activities of nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations in the United States, particularly in the context of their political engagement and the lack of media attention they receive. Thirty years ago, some foundations were found to be acting as conduits for CIA subsidies during the Cold War, and although this was disclosed, the issue eventually faded from public attention. The media and the public have since largely ignored the significant role these foundations play in politics and policy-making. Foundations are supposed to refrain from directly influencing political outcomes, but this rule is often violated. Some foundations receive federal funding, which critics argue may be misused for political purposes. The number of foundations has grown significantly, and their assets are substantial, with a few hundred controlling a large portion of the wealth. These foundations fund a variety of causes and movements, often with a liberal slant, and have been instrumental in shaping public policy and discourse. Some foundations, like the Ford Foundation, have also exerted influence over organizations like the NAACP and MALDEF, raising concerns about accountability and independence. The text also touches on the civic journalism movement, supported by foundations, which aims to involve the public in shaping the media's agenda. However, this has led to concerns about the press's independence. The author, Nicholas Lemann, suggests that the significant and growing influence of foundations warrants greater public scrutiny and debate regarding their activities and tax-exempt status.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, but it is mentioned in the context of the political influence of foundations. The text references the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), which has been involved in debates over immigration and affirmative action. MALDEF is noted to have no members and receives most of its funding from corporations and foundations, particularly the Ford Foundation. The author seems to imply a level of skepticism about the legitimacy of MALDEF's representation of the Latino community, given its lack of direct accountability to that community and its reliance on foundation funding. This could suggest that the author is critical of the way affirmative action and related advocacy may be shaped by the interests and agendas of powerful foundations rather than by grassroots support or democratic processes. However, the text does not provide a detailed examination of the author's views on the policy of affirmative action itself."	0.03699	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text presents a balanced view on affirmative action, acknowledging the existence of racial inequality while also criticizing the polarized nature of the debate. They seem to advocate for a fair society and hint at the need for temporary measures to address racial disparities, but also look forward to a time when race is less of a factor. The author's reference to progress in the NFL suggests an appreciation for merit-based success irrespective of race. The stance is not strongly in favor or against, but rather supports a nuanced approach to achieving racial fairness.	"Summary:
The text discusses the debate surrounding affirmative action, referencing the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the controversy over Bill Lann Lee's nomination in the Justice Department. The author criticizes the polarized arguments from both sides: one denying the existence of racial discrimination and the other labeling all opponents of affirmative action as racists. The author acknowledges that while blatant segregation has decreased, racial fairness is still not a reality in many aspects of society, such as corporate leadership and education. The author suggests that the real debate is about how to create a fair society, with some advocating for immediate colorblindness and others believing in the need to level the playing field first. The text concludes by noting the increasing number of black quarterbacks in the NFL as a sign of progress towards a society where ability matters more than race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to take a nuanced view on affirmative action. They recognize the complexity of the issue and the partial truths in both supporting and opposing arguments. The author believes that blatant racism has diminished but acknowledges that racial inequality persists in society. They suggest that most Americans desire fairness and do not support the extremes of either side of the debate. The author seems to support the idea of affirmative action as a temporary measure to level the playing field, indicating that once there is a fair chance for all, based on individual talent and effort, the focus on race can diminish. This perspective is illustrated by the evolution of black quarterbacks in the NFL, which the author cites as a positive development towards a society where race is less of a factor in determining one's opportunities and success."	0.02751	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's reflection on past civil rights struggles, the mention of decreased minority enrollment after the lifting of affirmative action policies, and the call for national conversation about race suggest a supportive stance towards affirmative action. The emphasis on the need for real economic and educational opportunities to address disparities indicates that the author views affirmative action as a necessary tool for promoting equality and diversity. The author's role as the secretary of transportation and the mention of recognizing every person's worth further support the idea that the author sees affirmative action as integral to building an inclusive society.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 40th anniversary of the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, by nine African American students. The author recalls personal experiences of racism and the struggle for civil rights, including a school sit-in that led to a confrontation with authorities. Despite progress made, the author points out the persistence of subtle racism and the challenges that arise when affirmative action rules are lifted, leading to decreased minority enrollment in universities. The author also mentions the changing demographics of America and the need for a national conversation about race. The writer, who is the secretary of transportation, emphasizes the importance of recognizing the worth of all people and the need for real economic and educational opportunities to address disparities that could be construed as racial discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary measure to address racial disparities and promote equality. The mention of minority enrollment plummeting when affirmative action rules are lifted at state universities suggests that the author believes these policies play a crucial role in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational environments. The author's call for honest dialogue and the building of a society that honors the dignity of every person indicates a belief that while laws can change institutions, changing people's hearts requires a more profound and ongoing effort. The author seems to view affirmative action as part of a broader strategy to cope with America's interdependence and respect differences, ultimately aiming to create a society where every individual has equal opportunities."	0.026370000000000005	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the complexities surrounding affirmative action, including the potential constitutional issues raised by Gratz's case and the challenges of assessing affirmative action's legality and impact on university admissions. They recognize the possibility of individual instances where affirmative action may disadvantage white applicants but do not argue that this makes the entire concept unconstitutional. Instead, they suggest that the Supreme Court may still permit the narrow use of race in admissions to promote diversity, indicating a belief in the potential benefits of affirmative action when properly implemented. This nuanced view suggests that the author is neither wholly for nor against affirmative action, but rather in favor of its careful and constitutional application.	"Summary:
Jennifer Gratz's lawsuit against the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy presents a challenge for affirmative action supporters. If Gratz wins, Michigan may have to end its race-conscious admissions, which could lead to a decrease in minority enrollment as seen in California and Texas. If she loses, opponents can bring the case to a Supreme Court that currently views affirmative action unfavorably. Gratz, represented by the Center for Individual Rights, argues she was wait-listed and rejected because she is white, which she believes violates the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke decision that race can be a factor in admissions but not to the exclusion of any candidate. While the University of Michigan has since modified its admissions system, the case raises questions about the role of race in admissions and whether Bakke is still valid law, especially after the Fifth Circuit's ruling against the University of Texas in Hopwood v. Texas.

Author's Perspective:
The author of the text appears to have a cautious perspective on affirmative action. They acknowledge that Gratz's case may have merit, especially since the University of Michigan had guidelines that could be constitutionally problematic under the Bakke decision, which the university has since revised. The author suggests it's challenging to prove that a student was rejected solely based on race, given the various factors in university admissions, and points out that the University of Michigan also gives preference to other non-racial factors.

The author seems to believe that while affirmative action programs may produce individual ""white victims,"" this does not necessarily mean the programs are unconstitutional. They also criticize the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas for prematurely ruling against race as a factor in admissions, suggesting that the Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action, particularly in the context of higher education, may still allow for some narrow use of race to promote diversity. The author's stance seems to support the idea that affirmative action, when used appropriately, can be constitutional and beneficial for fostering diversity in educational environments."	0.02858	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not provide a clear personal stance on affirmative action. The text merely mentions affirmative action in the broader context of local laws that could be undermined by international treaties like the MAI. The focus is on the sovereignty of U.S. states to maintain their policies, including affirmative action, in the face of globalization and international agreements. Since the author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed, it is not possible to categorize their stance on the issue.	"Summary:
The text discusses the increasing involvement of U.S. state and local governments in foreign policy matters, highlighting an incident where State Department officials lobbied Maryland state legislator Rushern L. Baker III to prevent sanctions against companies operating in Nigeria. The article notes the growing interconnectedness of the U.S. with global trade and investment, and the shift in trade talks from traditional tariffs to ""non-tariff barriers"" like foreign laws that affect U.S. exports. It also touches on the challenges and resistance faced by the U.S. in imposing its standards abroad and the need to accept international rules at home. The Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI) is mentioned as a controversial treaty that aims to protect foreign investments but has faced opposition for potentially undermining local laws and regulations, including affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action but does mention it in the context of the potential impact of the MAI. The author lists affirmative action as one of the local laws that could be challenged under the treaty, implying that such international agreements could limit the ability of U.S. states to maintain policies like affirmative action. The inclusion of affirmative action in the list of potentially affected policies suggests that the author is aware of its significance and the controversy surrounding it in the context of international trade agreements. However, the focus of the article is more on the broader implications of the MAI and similar treaties on local governance and the autonomy of U.S. states in setting their own policies, rather than on affirmative action specifically."	0.02912	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text presents a positive view of the advancements made by African Americans in higher education, as reported by Michael T. Nettles. While the text does not directly address the author's stance on affirmative action, it does emphasize the importance of the progress achieved and the need for continued efforts to address remaining challenges. The author's focus on statistical improvements and the recognition of ongoing issues such as enrollment, graduation rates, faculty representation, and academic performance suggests a perspective that may be supportive of policies like affirmative action that aim to improve educational opportunities for underrepresented groups. The concern for gender disparity and the need for targeted interventions further implies that the author may view affirmative action favorably as a means to address such disparities.	"Summary:
The text discusses the advancements of African Americans in higher education over the past two decades, as highlighted in a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education."" The author speaks with Michael T. Nettles, a University of Michigan professor and one of the report's principal authors, who shares statistical improvements such as the increase in African American baccalaureate degrees and their growing presence in various educational sectors. Despite the positive trends, Nettles acknowledges that there is still work to be done in areas such as enrollment, graduation rates, faculty representation, and the academic performance of black freshmen. The text also touches upon the gender disparity among African American undergraduates, with a significantly higher percentage of women than men. The author agrees with Nettles's optimistic perspective, emphasizing the importance of recognizing successes to build future progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly state the author's perspective on affirmative action. However, the author acknowledges the progress made by African Americans in higher education, which could be seen as a result of various policies, including affirmative action. The author's mention of the report and the discussion with Nettles suggests an appreciation for the positive outcomes that have been achieved, possibly implying support for programs that help foster such progress. The author's concern about the gender disparity and the early loss of boys in the education system may also hint at a belief in the need for targeted interventions, which could align with the principles of affirmative action. Overall, the author appears to value the gains made and recognizes the importance of understanding and building upon these successes, which could be interpreted as an endorsement of the continued need for affirmative action or similar initiatives."	0.02948	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action, referring to it as part of a 'racial spoils system' and suggesting it might exacerbate divisions, indicates a negative stance towards the policy. The use of terms like 'sanctimonious' to describe Bradley's approach to racial issues, which includes affirmative action, and the concern that such policies could hinder progress toward racial harmony, further reinforces the author's disapproval. The author's skepticism about whether Democratic policies like affirmative action might be counterproductive also suggests opposition to the policy. However, the author does not provide a detailed argument or strong language that would indicate a position of being 'strongly against.' Therefore, the author's stance is categorized as 'somewhat against' affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of the political strategies and positions of both Al Gore and Bill Bradley. Gore, as the serving vice president, faces the challenge of winning the presidency, which is historically difficult for incumbent vice presidents. The author criticizes Gore for making questionable claims and for exuding a sense of moral superiority that could alienate those who disagree with him. Bill Bradley, on the other hand, is gaining support as his poll numbers increase. However, the author is skeptical of Bradley's approach to the politics of ideas, particularly his speech on race, which the author perceives as sanctimonious and not effectively addressing the complexities of racial issues in America.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses a critical perspective on affirmative action, suggesting that it is part of a ""racial spoils system"" that may exacerbate divisions rather than heal them. The author implies that Bradley's approach to racial issues, which includes a focus on affirmative action, may not be conducive to reaching a point where race exists but does not matter. The author seems to argue that affirmative action and identity politics, which stress the importance of group identity over individual agency, could hinder progress toward racial harmony. The author also suggests that Bradley's candid talk about race does not extend to questioning whether Democratic policies like affirmative action might be counterproductive."	0.027200000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's discussion on affirmative action is limited and primarily focuses on Bill Clinton's policy approach rather than offering a direct opinion on the matter. The phrase 'mend it, don't end it' reflects a nuanced stance that suggests a willingness to reform rather than completely discard affirmative action. The author's perspective is not explicitly stated; instead, the text outlines Clinton's approach as a balance between populist demands and elite consensus. Therefore, the author's personal stance on affirmative action is not clear, and the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's viewpoint as for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the shift in American politics from a populist era to the dominance of elites during the Clinton administration. It argues that the personal controversies surrounding Bill Clinton and the political strategies he employed have helped to diminish the influence of populist movements that were fueled by grievances against establishment institutions and values since the late 1960s. The author notes that issues like tax cuts and term limits have lost their momentum, and there is a growing acceptance that the current leaders may be competent. The elite now consist of a mix of financial experts, policy advisers, and political consultants whose values prioritize expert knowledge. Despite Clinton's initial populist image, his presidency has made politics more favorable to educated elites. The article also touches on the role of the booming economy, lower crime rates, and successful military interventions in reducing populist sentiments. Clinton's use of polling to finely tune policy positions, such as his stance on affirmative action and tax cuts, is highlighted as a method for neutralizing populist fervor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Clinton has a nuanced approach to affirmative action, encapsulated in the phrase ""mend it, don't end it."" This indicates that Clinton acknowledges the issues within the policy but does not seek its complete removal, instead aiming to reform it. The author implies that this careful positioning is a product of elite influence and strategic polling, which allows the administration to address populist concerns without fully capitulating to them. The perspective presented is that affirmative action, like other policies, is subject to the balancing act between populist demands and elite consensus in the Clinton era."	0.03765	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. However, the author's discussion of white conservative voters' support for black candidates who oppose policies like affirmative action, described as 'Satan's own tool,' suggests a critical view of affirmative action. The author acknowledges the possibility of race-neutral support for black candidates by white conservatives but also highlights the irony that such support often goes to those who hold views unpopular with the majority of the black community, which likely includes opposition to affirmative action. This complexity in the author's discussion does not allow for a definitive categorization of their stance as it reflects on the views of conservative voters rather than directly stating the author's own views on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's observations and reflections on the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes, an African American presidential candidate, and the broader implications for racial attitudes in politics. The author examines the possibility of white voters genuinely disregarding a candidate's race and instead focusing on their political views. The author recalls instances where white voters have supported black politicians, such as David Dinkins and Doug Wilder, but suggests that such support might sometimes stem from racial guilt. The author also reflects on Strom Thurmond's support for Clarence Thomas during his Supreme Court nomination hearings, which seemed to transcend racial considerations. However, the author points out that white conservatives tend to support African American candidates who hold views that are unpopular with the majority of black voters, raising questions about whether these conservatives are truly overlooking race or simply aligning with black individuals who share their conservative values. The author concludes by suggesting that it is possible for white conservatives to support black candidates based on shared principles and that this could indicate a positive shift in racial dynamics within conservative circles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a critical view of affirmative action, as indicated by the text's reference to conservative opposition to affirmative action, which they describe as ""Satan's own tool."" The author seems to acknowledge that conservative voters have the capacity to support black candidates based on shared political philosophies rather than race, but also raises the irony that these voters often support African American candidates whose views are not representative of the broader black community. This suggests that the author sees a complex relationship between conservatives' racial attitudes and their political choices, including their stance on affirmative action. The author implies that while some white conservatives can look beyond race, their support for black candidates might be contingent upon those candidates rejecting policies like affirmative action that aim to address racial inequalities."	0.02921	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	0
	None	The author expresses concern about the influence of the Democratic Leadership Council on Al Gore's stance on affirmative action and whether George W. Bush's administration will genuinely reflect the diversity he claims to support. This indicates that the author is attentive to issues of racial diversity and equality, particularly within the context of affirmative action. However, the text does not provide a definitive stance for or against affirmative action but rather a desire for transparency from the presidential candidates regarding how they will handle these policies. The author's concern is more about the potential impact of the candidates' advisers and administration members on affirmative action rather than a direct endorsement or rejection of the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of presidential candidates revealing their potential administration members before the election. It emphasizes that knowing who will help run the federal government is crucial for voters, as these individuals will shape national policy. The author mentions the lack of information about who would be on George W. Bush's and Al Gore's teams if elected. The piece argues that Bush needs to prove whether his administration will reflect the diversity he claims to support, while Gore faces questions about whether the Democratic Leadership Council's influence will affect affirmative action and other policies. The author suggests that voters are better informed and deserve to know the composition of the future cabinet before voting, rather than waiting for the traditional transition period after the election.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to be concerned about the future of affirmative action and other policies that support racial diversity and equality. They note that most African Americans and voters of color are likely to support Gore due to the Clinton administration's record on civil rights and diverse appointments. However, with the Democratic Leadership Council's rise to prominence within the Democratic Party, the author questions whether a Gore administration might roll back on affirmative action or other policies that benefit cities, rural communities, and close the achievement gap in schools. The author's perspective suggests a desire for transparency from candidates on issues like affirmative action, to ensure that voters can make an informed decision based on how these policies will be addressed by the potential administration."	0.02997	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on Joseph Lieberman's political stance and history, including a brief mention that he has previously questioned affirmative action. The author's view on the issue is inferred through the discussion of Lieberman's nuanced approach and the suggestion that he supports affirmative action as part of the Democratic platform during the campaign. The text suggests the author recognizes the complexities of the issue and seems to appreciate politicians who take a thoughtful approach to such policies. However, without a clear statement of the author's own stance on affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize the author definitively.	"Summary:
Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the American public, emphasizing his background as a classic American success story and the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president. His speech at the convention was well-received, and he aimed to align himself with mainstream Democratic values despite past criticisms of Clinton-Gore fundraising and President Clinton's ethical issues. Lieberman glossed over some of his independent positions, such as his previous questioning of affirmative action and support for tort reform and school vouchers, focusing instead on areas of agreement with Al Gore, like health care and environmental policies. He highlighted differences between Democrats and Republicans, particularly on tax plans and social security. Lieberman has been known for acknowledging the complexities of issues like affirmative action and public schools, and the text questions whether the Gore ticket can offer new ideas while maintaining support from core Democratic constituents. Education reform, including standards and accountability, is presented as a potential area for new policy. The Democrats' success is attributed to balancing traditional positions with fresh approaches, including fiscal responsibility and openness to new management styles and competition, as seen in their support for charter schools.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author notes that Senator Lieberman has previously questioned affirmative action, suggesting a level of skepticism or nuanced view on the policy. However, in his speech, Lieberman endorsed affirmative action, aligning with the Democratic Party's stance. The author seems to recognize Lieberman's history of being open to discussing the complexities and challenges of such policies, indicating that the senator may have a more thoughtful and less doctrinaire approach to affirmative action than some of his colleagues. The overall perspective suggests that while Lieberman has had reservations about affirmative action in the past, he has chosen to support it publicly as part of the Democratic platform. The text also implies that the author appreciates politicians like Lieberman who are willing to acknowledge the intricacies of contentious issues and are open to new ideas, even if it requires navigating the expectations of their party's core supporters."	0.03014	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	0
	None	The author does not directly state their own position on affirmative action, instead focusing on John Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee because of Lee's views on affirmative action. The author uses this opposition to illustrate a broader point about the influence of personal beliefs on law enforcement policy. The discussion on affirmative action serves to highlight concerns about Ashcroft's potential bias in policy setting. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the text does not provide sufficient evidence to categorize the author's stance as for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding John Ashcroft's nomination for attorney general. While Ashcroft's supporters argue he is qualified and would enforce the law fairly, the author believes this misses the point, as the attorney general also sets law enforcement policy. The author questions what ""fair"" enforcement means, given the discretion involved in prioritizing which laws to enforce and how. The concern stems from Ashcroft's record of advocating for conservative positions on issues like gun control, abortion, juvenile justice, and the death penalty, which are outside the American mainstream. The author references Ashcroft's response to a question about undermining Roe v. Wade, suggesting Ashcroft acknowledges the influence he could have on law enforcement policy. The text concludes by recalling Ashcroft's own reasoning for opposing Bill Lann Lee's nomination for head of the Justice Department's civil rights division due to Lee's views on affirmative action, suggesting the same logic could apply to Ashcroft's nomination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context in which it is mentioned. The author recalls an instance where John Ashcroft opposed Bill Lann Lee's nomination because of Lee's beliefs on affirmative action, which Ashcroft felt would limit his capacity to make balanced judgments. This reference implies that the author sees affirmative action as a contentious issue that can significantly influence an individual's approach to law enforcement policy. The author appears to suggest that just as Ashcroft believed Lee's views on affirmative action could impact his role, so too could Ashcroft's conservative views affect his capacity to serve as attorney general. The author does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action but uses it to illustrate the importance of an official's beliefs in shaping policy and enforcement priorities."	0.027719999999999998	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action. They simply report on the Bush administration's appointments and provide statistical data comparing the diversity to previous administrations. The text does not contain any evaluative language or judgment regarding the policy of affirmative action itself, suggesting that the author is presenting the information objectively without taking a clear position in favor or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Bush administration's decision to rescind a Clinton-era regulation that aimed to lower arsenic levels in drinking water, which led to significant backlash. Jonathan Adler, a former senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, expressed that the administration should have easily defended this decision based on the merits but failed due to poor communication and the lack of understanding among environmental journalists. Environmentalists, like Elliott Negin from the Natural Resources Defense Council, argue that the facts do not support the Bush administration's stance, noting that the old federal arsenic standard is outdated and does not reflect the known carcinogenic nature of arsenic.

The text also mentions a fundraiser for Senator Maria Cantwell, the appointment of Charles A. Heimbold Jr. as ambassador to Sweden, and other political appointments and ambassadorships. It ends with a comparison of the demographic makeup of President Bush's top-tier appointments with those of previous administrations, highlighting that 40% of Bush's appointments are women and minorities, which is higher than the percentages during the Clinton and Reagan administrations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author notes that the Bush administration claims there is no affirmative action in its appointment process. However, the text provides statistics showing that a significant proportion of Bush's appointments for positions requiring Senate confirmation are women and minorities (40% combined), which is a higher percentage than in previous administrations. The author seems to present these statistics neutrally, without offering a personal opinion on affirmative action. Instead, the author provides factual comparisons to illustrate the diversity of the appointments under the Bush administration relative to its predecessors."	0.025839999999999995	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to be critical of conservative perspectives on judicial nominations and their interpretation of the Constitution. While the summary does not provide a direct statement from the author specifically regarding affirmative action, it does indicate that the author is critical of conservative efforts to overturn affirmative action policies and believes that their stance is ideologically driven rather than grounded in a consistent judicial philosophy. The author seems to suggest that the conservative approach to affirmative action is selective and not genuinely based on a strict constructionist view of the Constitution. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author is likely against the conservative critique of affirmative action, but the text does not provide enough information to determine if the author is in favor of affirmative action or to what extent.	"Summary:
The text is a critical analysis of conservative perspectives on the process of judicial nominations and the concept of ""advice and consent"" as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The author argues that conservatives, who typically advocate for a strict constructionist approach to the Constitution, often interpret the ""advice and consent"" clause in a way that suits their political agenda, particularly when the presidency and the Senate are controlled by opposing parties. The author contends that conservatives impose limitations on the Senate's power to consent and disregard the advisory role it should play in the nomination process. They also accuse liberals of being ""ideological"" when challenging conservative nominees, while framing their own objections to liberal nominees as matters of philosophical principle. The conservative judicial philosophy, which includes terms like ""judicial restraint,"" ""strict construction,"" and ""original intent,"" is presented as being above dispute, but the author challenges this assertion, pointing out inconsistencies in its application. The text also touches on the politics of judicial nominations during the Clinton administration and the testimony of Clint Bolick, who represents a conservative legal group.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that conservatives are selective in their application of judicial philosophies and that they often push for judicial activism when it aligns with their goals, such as overturning affirmative action policies. The author implies that conservatives believe the Constitution clearly opposes affirmative action and that judicial restraint is not appropriate in this context. However, the author criticizes this stance, arguing that conservative buzzwords like ""strict construction"" and ""original intent"" do not provide a definitive guide to constitutional interpretation, especially on complex issues like affirmative action. The author seems to view conservative opposition to affirmative action as ideologically driven and inconsistent with their professed commitment to judicial restraint and deference to the elected branches of government."	0.03285	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	0
	None	The author discusses affirmative action primarily in the context of political strategy, without providing a direct moral or ideological evaluation of the policy itself. The focus is on how politicians like Bill Clinton have used issues such as affirmative action to maintain loyalty among their core base while also appealing to swing voters. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main subject of the text, and there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the matter. Therefore, the author is categorized as 'not concerned with affirmative action' in the sense that their perspective on the policy is not the focus of the discussion.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on President George W. Bush's political acumen, suggesting that despite initial underestimations of his intelligence, particularly verbal intelligence, he has demonstrated significant political intelligence. The author acknowledges that Bush's success in public opinion may be attributed to factors such as low expectations and the shortcomings of his predecessor. However, the author argues that Bush's true strength lies in his understanding of political dynamics, particularly the concept of triangulation, which was also used effectively by Bill Clinton. Triangulation involves satisfying the core base, neutralizing the opposition, and appealing to swing voters. The author notes that Bush has satisfied his core supporters on issues like abortion and taxes while also making strategic concessions, such as opposing racial profiling, to appeal to swing voters and weaken his opposition without alienating his core base. The author concludes by recognizing Bush as a ""smart guy"" with natural political intelligence.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as one of the ""nonnegotiables"" for the core base of the Democratic Party during Bill Clinton's presidency. Clinton is credited with unwaveringly supporting affirmative action, among other key issues, to maintain the loyalty of his core voters. The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action but indicates that it was a strategic move for Clinton to champion such issues to secure his core base's support while also appealing to swing voters by compromising on other, less critical issues. The discussion of affirmative action is within the context of political strategy rather than a moral or ideological evaluation of the policy itself."	0.02751	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical discussion of the lack of intellectual diversity within academia, particularly regarding the exclusion of conservative perspectives, suggests a skepticism towards affirmative action as it is applied in academic settings. The mention of affirmative action as a potential barrier for those who disagree with it in certain fields indicates that the author may see it as a form of ideological conformity that excludes dissenting views. However, the summary does not provide explicit statements of the author's stance on affirmative action in general, only within the specific context of academia. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, at least insofar as it contributes to what they perceive as a lack of diversity of thought in higher education.	"Summary:
The article discusses the political imbalance in academia, where studies have found that Democrats significantly outnumber Republicans among faculty members, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. The ratio of Democrats to Republicans has increased over the years, with younger professors being more liberal than their retiring older counterparts. This trend is seen across various prestigious universities, with voter registration records reflecting a strong liberal dominance. The article also mentions that the University of California system and Harvard were among the top contributors to the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004. 

George Lakoff, a professor at Berkeley, suggests that the disparity is due to conservatives' lack of interest in academic careers, as liberals are more inclined to work for the public good and social justice. Mark Bauerlein, a professor at Emory University, argues that the academic culture inherently excludes conservatives through a filtering process that starts from graduate school admissions to tenure decisions. He asserts that academic fields have established political orientations that define scholarship, effectively barring those with opposing views. Bauerlein also discusses the ""false consensus effect"" and ""the law of group polarization,"" which lead to extreme beliefs within homogeneous groups. The article concludes by stating that while academia promotes diversity in many aspects, it lacks diversity of thought, making it intellectually monochrome.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least within the context of academia. He implies that affirmative action has become a dogmatic principle in certain academic fields to the extent that disagreeing with it can disqualify someone from pursuing a degree in those fields. For example, he mentions that disapproval of affirmative action could prevent someone from studying African-American studies. The author's tone suggests that he views affirmative action as part of the ""smelly little orthodoxies"" that contribute to the political and intellectual homogeneity on college campuses. He seems to argue that such orthodoxy is excluding conservative perspectives and contributing to a lack of intellectual diversity."	0.03129	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary. The text focuses on the role of individual justices in the Supreme Court and how their ideologies can shape the court's decisions, using Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's influence on the affirmative action ruling as an example. However, the author does not explicitly state their own view on affirmative action, instead they report on the impact of a justice's ideology on the court's ruling in a factual manner.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's discretion concerning the health of its justices, specifically referring to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's cancer diagnosis. The limited information provided about Rehnquist's condition has sparked debate about what the public has a right to know given the court's significant role in policymaking. Some argue that in light of the court's influence, transparency is necessary, while others defend the court's privacy, citing the constitutional differences between the judiciary and other branches of government. Additionally, the text mentions a study in the North Carolina Law Review that quantitatively confirms Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's central role on the court and her ideological shift to the left, which impacted key decisions such as the court's approval of affirmative action in college admissions in 2003.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author highlights the importance of individual justices' ideologies in the Supreme Court's decision-making process, specifically pointing out Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role and ideological shift as instrumental in the court's approval of affirmative action in college admissions. The study mentioned in the text suggests that without O'Connor's leftward movement, the likelihood of the court upholding affirmative action programs would have been small. This indicates that the author recognizes the nuanced and dynamic nature of the Supreme Court's composition and how individual justices can influence landmark decisions, such as those concerning affirmative action. The author does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action but emphasizes the significance of O'Connor's vote and reasoning in the court's narrow decision to uphold it."	0.02537	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's text does not primarily focus on affirmative action, but rather on the broader issue of political attacks on the judiciary and the threat to judicial independence. Affirmative action is mentioned as an example of a controversial issue where the judiciary has reflected the views of a narrow majority of Americans, suggesting that the courts are not out of touch with public opinion. The author's personal stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the reference to affirmative action is used to support a different argument about the judiciary rather than to express a view on the policy itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the increasing threats and political attacks against judges in the United States, particularly highlighted by the Terri Schiavo case. The author notes that judges are being thrust into the public eye and subjected to personal attacks when their rulings are unfavorable to certain politicians or litigants. The personalization of the judiciary is seen as a threat to judicial independence. The author points out that both liberals and conservatives are guilty of attacking judges, and that in many controversial cases, the judiciary has actually supported the majority views of the American people, contrary to accusations of being anti-democratic. The text also criticizes the role of interest groups in exacerbating the situation, the media's focus on judges' political affiliations, and the changing behavior of jurors. The author suggests that judges should resist the spotlight, follow the law scrupulously, and avoid grandiose assertions of judicial supremacy to maintain their independence.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus solely on affirmative action, the author references it within the context of the broader discussion of the judiciary's alignment with public opinion. The author suggests that, contrary to the criticism that the judiciary is out of touch with the American public, the Rehnquist court has supported the views of a narrow majority of Americans on controversial issues, including affirmative action. This indicates that the author believes the judiciary, in cases related to affirmative action, has not acted as an anti-democratic force but rather has reflected the constitutional views of national majorities. The author does not provide a personal opinion on affirmative action itself but instead uses it as an example to argue against the notion that judges are elitist and disconnected from public sentiment."	0.0363	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	0
	None	The author does not directly express personal views on affirmative action within the provided text. The discussion is centered around the role of interest groups in shaping political discourse and legislative priorities, rather than the author's stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of it being a divisive issue among many that interest groups mobilize around, without providing any specific arguments for or against it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the influence of interest groups on the political agenda in Washington, D.C. It highlights that while Social Security is often a topic of debate, other more pressing issues like Medicare, Medicaid, and crises facing states and international institutions are sometimes overshadowed. The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, illustrates how well-established organizations with significant resources, such as AARP, the Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, shape public discourse and influence legislative priorities. He uses the example of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) and its successful campaign to bring attention to the ""death tax."" Birnbaum also touches on the role of interest groups in the Terri Schiavo case and the battle over judicial nominations. He concludes that while organized interests can make a difference in politics, not every important issue has a powerful group advocating for it, leaving some concerns unaddressed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express his personal views on affirmative action within the provided text. However, he does mention it as one of the divisive issues that interest groups on both sides of the political spectrum have been mobilizing support for over the years. The text suggests that the author recognizes affirmative action as a contentious topic that is part of a larger set of social issues, including gay rights and abortion rights, which are influenced by organized interest groups. These groups contribute to the intensity and passion surrounding the debates on such matters, including the conflict over judicial nominees in the Senate. Birnbaum's perspective, as inferred from the text, is more focused on the process of how interest groups impact political priorities and less on the substantive merits or criticisms of affirmative action policies themselves."	0.039900000000000005	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of affirmative action is limited and presented as a factual component of Tel Aviv's efforts to be inclusive, without a strong sense of advocacy or opposition. The author acknowledges the city's affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs as part of its secular and liberal ethos, which suggests a mild endorsement. However, the complexities and challenges mentioned indicate an awareness of the limitations and ongoing struggles surrounding these policies. The author's stance is not the central focus of the text, which is primarily about Tel Aviv's broader history and culture.	"Summary:
The text is an exploration of Tel Aviv's history, culture, and contemporary life. It begins with a nod to the ancient port of Jaffa, which is associated with biblical events. The narrative then shifts to the founding of Tel Aviv in the late 1800s as the first modern Jewish city, which became a haven for Zionist immigrants. As Tel Aviv celebrates its centennial, it has evolved from an immigrant destination to a notorious party town and a center for culture and finance. The city is seen by some as the realization of Theodore Herzl's Zionist vision, being creative and tolerant, while others view it critically due to its secularism and distance from the ongoing conflict that characterizes other Israeli cities like Jerusalem.

The city has a diverse population, with a history of violence but also a strong focus on preservation, such as the Bauhaus architecture. Discussions about rising property values and rent control reflect concerns about maintaining the city's accessibility for various social groups. Yael Dayan, City Council Chairman, emphasizes Tel Aviv's secular and liberal ethos, mentioning affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs. However, there are tensions around gentrification in Arab neighborhoods. The city's vibrant nightlife contrasts with the more conservative practices of other towns on the Sabbath. Personal stories, such as that of a gay couple with a child, illustrate the city's openness and diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action in Tel Aviv in a relatively positive light, as part of the city's efforts to be inclusive and tolerant. The mention of affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs is framed within the context of Tel Aviv's identity as a secular, liberal, and pluralistic city. This reflects an endorsement of such policies as a means to address social inequalities and promote diversity within the workforce. However, the author also acknowledges the complexities and challenges of the situation, such as the potential for gentrification in Arab neighborhoods and the limited electoral success of an Arab mayoral candidate, which suggests that affirmative action is part of a broader and ongoing conversation about equality and integration in the city."	0.03553	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in terms of personal support or opposition. Instead, the author focuses on the Christian Coalition's historical opposition to affirmative action and their new initiative, the Samaritan Project, which could signal a shift in engagement with African-American communities. The text presents a cautious optimism about the potential for positive change, while acknowledging past opposition to affirmative action by the coalition. The author's stance is not clearly in favor or against affirmative action but rather reflects a nuanced view of the Christian Coalition's evolving approach.	"Summary:
The text discusses the possibility of Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, bridging the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. Despite the Christian Coalition's history of opposing affirmative action and welfare reform—stances typically supported by mainstream civil rights leaders—Reed has acknowledged the wrongs of historical cooperation with slavery and segregation by religious conservatives. To address social injustices and promote racial justice, the Christian Coalition has launched the Samaritan Project, aimed at supporting low-income, inner-city neighborhoods, particularly through partnerships with inner-city churches. The initiative also includes a conference to create an agenda for multiracial cooperation. The author notes that while the project could help the Christian Coalition gain moral and political clout, it also offers an opportunity for conservatives to engage with the African-American community in new ways.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a skeptical view of the Christian Coalition's stance on affirmative action. The text highlights that, traditionally, the coalition, under leaders like Ralph Reed, has vigorously opposed affirmative action. However, the author seems to cautiously welcome the coalition's new initiative to engage with African-American communities through the Samaritan Project. While there is an acknowledgment of the coalition's past opposition to affirmative action, the author seems open to the possibility that the coalition's efforts could lead to positive changes, suggesting a wait-and-see approach to whether the Samaritan Project will be genuinely beneficial or if it has ulterior motives. The author's perspective appears to be one of cautious optimism, mixed with a recognition of the political complexities surrounding the Christian Coalition's outreach efforts."	0.02713	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective suggests support for affirmative action, specifically as a tool for creating a more diverse police force in Chicago. The text praises the Mayor's efforts to promote diversity and critiques opposition to the plan, indicating a belief in the value of a representative police force. The acknowledgment of the written test's limitations and the emphasis on other qualities for a good police officer further imply the author's support for affirmative action measures beyond standard testing. Moreover, the author's call for judicial recognition of the difference between quotas and the need for diversity aligns with an affirmative action-friendly viewpoint. The author's stance is not described as extreme or radical, hence the classification as 'somewhat in favor' rather than 'strongly in favor'.	"Summary:
The text discusses the strategy announced by Mayor Richard Daley's administration to diversify the Chicago police force, which has been dominated by non-Hispanic whites, to better reflect the city's racial and ethnic demographics. The plan includes promoting 70 percent of new sergeants based on written test results and 30 percent based on job performance, with the latter aiming to ensure racial and ethnic balance. The police union criticized the plan, fearing a return to political cronyism, while the African-American Police League felt insulted, claiming that the written test is racially biased. The text acknowledges that while job performance is an important criterion for promotions, the plan's success is uncertain due to potential judicial challenges against race-based promotion systems.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, particularly as a means to create a police force that is more representative of Chicago's diverse population. They applaud Mayor Daley for his efforts to diversify the police force and criticize those who oppose the plan for placing self-interest above the common good. The author argues that while the written test may be fair, it does not capture all the necessary qualities of a good police officer, such as common sense, compassion, and community knowledge. The text suggests that a wise jurist should recognize the difference between affirmative action quotas and the legitimate need for a diverse police force that can effectively serve its community. The author believes that Daley's plan, despite not being perfect, deserves support as it attempts to balance merit with the need for diversity."	0.02431	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, discuss the legacy of Malcolm X and the ongoing challenges of segregation and education within the black community. They reference the consequences of inequality and societal separateness, and express concern over the impact of a ban on affirmative action at the University of California, Berkeley, which is expected to result in a significant decrease in black student representation in the law school. This concern, coupled with the context of the article, suggests that they view affirmative action as a vital tool for addressing inequality and promoting diversity, and the expected enrollment of only one black student in the law school class without it underscores the potential negative effects of not having such policies in place.	"Summary:
The New Yorker issue from July 7 discussed the well-attended memorial service for Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, contrasting it with the sparsely attended funeral of her husband in 1965. Shabazz, who earned a doctorate and was a civil rights advocate, is seen as a reminder of the internal conflicts within the black community regarding integration and the ongoing challenges in education and segregation. Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and writer Hendrik Hertzberg reflect on the legacy of Malcolm X, suggesting that while his separatist views are not widely embraced, his aspirations for greater roles for blacks in society are still relevant. The authors also touch on the consequences of inequality and its contribution to societal separateness. The piece ends with a mention of the potential impact of a new ban on affirmative action at the University of California, Berkeley, where only one black student is expected in the next law school class.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, appear to view affirmative action as a necessary measure to address inequality and promote diversity, particularly in education. They imply that the ban on affirmative action at the University of California, Berkeley, could lead to a significant decrease in black student representation, as evidenced by the expected enrollment of only one black student in the upcoming law school class. This suggests that they see affirmative action as a tool to combat the separateness and inequality that persists in the aftermath of the civil rights era. The authors seem to advocate for affirmative action as a means to fulfill the hopes of figures like Malcolm X for greater inclusion and representation of blacks in all sectors of society."	0.025779999999999997	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action in university admissions, the argument against eliminating the SAT, and the emphasis on the necessity for educational reform to address the root causes of academic under-preparation among minority students indicate a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action, at least in the form it is being discussed. The author does not outright reject the concept of affirmative action but criticizes its current application in the context of admissions and the use of racial preferences without addressing educational disparities at the K-12 level.	"Summary:
The author discusses the issue of affirmative action in university admissions, specifically regarding the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California and their reaction to the elimination of racial preferences. The task force is concerned that without racial preferences, the enrollment of Latino students will decline. Instead of seeking to improve the academic performance of Hispanic applicants, they propose to eliminate the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), on which Hispanic and black students score lower on average than white students. The author argues against the criticism of the SAT as culturally biased, reflecting family income, and not predicting college performance. The article points out that Asian-Americans outperform other minorities and whites on the SAT, and that family income doesn't fully explain disparities in scores. The author suggests that high school grades combined with SAT scores provide a more accurate prediction of college success and notes the existing problem of grade inflation. The author concludes that the real issue is the poor academic preparation provided by elementary and secondary schools to black and Hispanic students, not the SAT itself. The author cites ""America in Black and White"" by Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom, which notes high dropout rates among black undergraduates, potentially due to racial preferences placing them in overly demanding schools.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author takes a critical stance on affirmative action, particularly in the context of university admissions. The author believes that affirmative action, as it was being used, leads to the admission of students who are not academically prepared for the rigors of college due to poor preparation from their elementary and secondary education. The author argues that eliminating the SAT as a measure to increase minority enrollment would not address the underlying issue of inadequate academic preparation. Instead, the author suggests that efforts should be focused on improving the quality of education in grade schools and high schools to prepare students for college, rather than lowering standards or removing standardized tests like the SAT. The author also challenges the notion that the SAT is unfair, citing evidence that counters claims of cultural bias and the idea that the test merely reflects family income. Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action in the form of admissions preferences based on race is a misguided solution that does not serve the students it intends to help and that the focus should be on educational reform at earlier stages."	0.03303	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective indicates a clear support for affirmative action, as they see it as a means to rectify historical injustices and promote diversity in the workplace. The emphasis on the need for black women to have access to job training programs that match their ambitions and capabilities, as well as the mention of businesses benefiting from a diverse and skilled workforce, suggest that the author views affirmative action positively. The advocacy for proactive efforts and continuous learning, especially for underrepresented groups, further underscores their favorable stance towards affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The article discusses a study titled ""Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991,"" which examined the participation of black and white women in job training programs over two decades. The study found that participation in these programs doubled for both groups, but white women were more likely to be involved in managerial and professional training. In the 1970s, black women were predominantly in clerical and semiskilled programs and underrepresented in higher-level training. This segregation in job training decreased in the 1980s, but overall participation of black women declined. The study also noted that job training led to higher wages regardless of program duration or the participant's education and work history.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors of the study support affirmative action as a means to address historical injustices and increase diversity in the workplace. They argue that access to job training is essential for raising income levels and should be expanded, not restricted. They emphasize that businesses benefit from investing in on-the-job training, which can lead to a more diverse and qualified workforce. The authors advocate for proactive efforts to ensure that black women have access to job training programs that align with their aspirations and abilities. They also stress the importance of lifelong learning and skill acquisition to meet the demands of a changing workplace. The authors suggest that businesses should view on-the-job training as an investment in human capital and encourage continuous learning, especially for mid-career employees. They highlight the need to avoid stereotypical roles for women and to utilize the full potential of all employees, including black women who are underrepresented in managerial positions. Overall, the authors see affirmative action and job training as tools for both individual advancement and business growth."	0.02975	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action as a tool for achieving racial and ethnic diversity in the police and fire departments, viewing it as a corrective measure for historical injustices. The positive portrayal of Mayor Daley's efforts to integrate these services and the negative view of the unions' resistance indicate a belief in the necessity and value of affirmative action policies. The call for black and Hispanic police and firefighters to be more active in their unions further underscores the author's advocacy for affirmative action as a means to promote equity and representation.	"Summary:
The text discusses the efforts of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago to integrate the city's police and fire departments with more black and Hispanic officers through the use of affirmative action policies. Daley's attempts are contrasted with the resistance from the police and fire unions, particularly the Fraternal Order of Police and the Chicago Fire Fighters Union. The police union is criticized for running misleading radio ads against the use of job performance as a factor in promotions, while the fire union is described as having reluctantly agreed to a similar measure only when certain concessions were made. The text suggests that despite the unions' opposition, the Daley administration is committed to creating a more racially and ethnically representative public safety workforce. It also calls on black and Hispanic police and firefighters to become more active and organized within their unions to facilitate change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a means to correct historical injustices and promote diversity within the police and fire departments. The author views Mayor Daley's commitment to integrating these services as a positive step, even if it may be politically motivated. The unions' resistance to affirmative action is portrayed negatively, with the author suggesting that their actions are obstructive to progress and equity. The author implies that affirmative action is necessary to overcome entrenched biases and to ensure that the racial and ethnic makeup of the city's public safety workforce reflects that of the broader community. The author also seems to believe that minority members within the unions should be more proactive in advocating for affirmative action and other measures that support diversity and fairness."	0.02281	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of the historic settlement for African-American farmers and the comparison to reparations made by Germany suggests a focus on corrective measures for historical injustices. While the author does not directly state their position on affirmative action, the comparison to reparations and the framing of reparations as a less controversial and more justified approach imply a perspective that is at least somewhat in favor of initiatives aimed at addressing past discrimination. The author's view that reparations spread the cost across the tax system and serve as a moral responsibility indicates a positive view towards systemic efforts to rectify historical wrongs. However, without explicit endorsement or criticism of affirmative action policies, it is not entirely clear how strongly the author supports affirmative action itself, as they seem to be advocating for reparations as a specific form of redress.	"Summary:
The text discusses the historic settlement in which the U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed to pay reparations to African-American farmers for past racial discrimination. This settlement, approved by a federal judge, was the result of a class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 by black farmers who faced discrimination in receiving farm loans and subsidies from the USDA. The settlement includes at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief for each affected farmer and the return of foreclosed lands. The decline of African-American farmers from 14% in 1920 to less than 1% is attributed to discriminatory practices by the USDA. The total claims are expected to exceed $375 million, although the farmers sought $3.5 billion and many believe the settlement is insufficient. The lawsuit and settlement provide a basis for broader claims of reparations for African-Americans due to historical injustices, including slavery and segregation. Rep. John Conyers has introduced a bill to study reparations, but it has not gained traction. The author compares this to Germany's reparations to Jewish victims after World War II and references the limited ""40 acres and a mule"" policy during Reconstruction. President Bill Clinton, who was impeached, is noted for resuming the reparations experiment that was halted by another impeached president, Andrew Johnson.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view reparations as a more justified and less controversial alternative to affirmative action and other preference policies. They suggest that reparations offer a logical and morally responsible way to address historical wrongs, spreading the cost across the tax system. The author contrasts the acrimonious debates surrounding affirmative action with the rationale for reparations, which are framed as a necessary measure to compensate for the long-term economic and social disadvantages experienced by African-Americans due to slavery, segregation, and ongoing discrimination. The perspective is that reparations should be seen as a matter of economic and moral responsibility rather than a contentious issue like affirmative action."	0.03211	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's criticism of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union's contract offer that seeks to eliminate 'merit' promotions, which have aided the advancement of minority firefighters, indicates a clear support for affirmative action. The author's call for Mayor Richard Daley to use the negotiations to end racist practices further underscores their belief in the importance of affirmative action policies in promoting diversity and combatting racism. The author's tone and choice of words suggest a strong disapproval of actions that undermine affirmative action, thus placing them in strong support of such measures.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, particularly its president William Kugelman, for presenting a contract offer that reflects racism and pettiness. The union's offer includes a significant pay raise request and changes to work rules, but what is particularly offensive is the attempt to eliminate ""merit"" promotions, which have helped advance some black and Hispanic firefighters. Additionally, the union's demand to add Arbor Day and Bud Billiken Day (a day celebrating black youth in Chicago) as paid holidays is seen as a mocking gesture. The author urges Mayor Richard Daley to use the contract negotiations as an opportunity to implement reforms and end racist practices within the fire department.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be a strong supporter of affirmative action, as they criticize the union's opposition to it and the attempt to remove merit-based promotions, which have been beneficial in promoting diversity within the fire department. The author views the union's stance as a step backward in the fight against racism and emphasizes the need for a fire service command structure that reflects the diversity of the city it serves. The tone suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a necessary tool to achieve equality and diversity in the workplace and that efforts to undermine it are unjust and harmful to the community."	0.01965	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt	0
	None	The text provided does not contain any specific information or opinions about affirmative action. The author discusses online tools for matching voters with presidential candidates based on policy issues, but does not reveal their own stance on affirmative action or any other particular issue. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action based on the given summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses how the Internet can assist in the process of choosing a presidential candidate that aligns with one's own political views. It highlights websites like selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com, which offer questionnaires on various national issues and match users with candidates accordingly. The author shares their personal experience with these sites, revealing that Libertarian Harry Browne topped their list, with Alan Keyes, Orrin Hatch, George W. Bush, and Steve Forbes following. The text notes that these tools are not perfect, as they may overlook certain issues or factors such as experience, temperament, and political skills. The author also expresses skepticism about some candidates, including Pat Buchanan, whom the author rejects despite the website's neutral ranking. Overall, the author suggests that while these quizzes are not comprehensive, they are useful for focusing on policy issues and can help voters make more informed decisions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, affirmative action is mentioned as one of the issues included in the questionnaires from selectsmart.com, which implies that it is considered an important topic in the political landscape. The author's personal views on affirmative action, or how it influenced their matching with candidates, are not detailed in the provided text. The focus of the text is more on the general utility and limitations of online political quizzes rather than on specific policy positions."	0.025639999999999996	affirmative action	txt/419118450.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text admires Clarence Thomas's courage and guts, particularly noting his willingness to question commonly accepted positions on race-related issues such as affirmative action. The author implies support for Thomas's critical stance on affirmative action by suggesting that it requires courage to challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding such policies, and by highlighting the lack of real debate or honest discussion on these issues. The author's perspective seems aligned with Thomas's views, which are known to be critical of affirmative action. Therefore, the author likely holds a perspective that is either somewhat against or strongly against affirmative action, depending on the intensity of the language used in the text which is not fully disclosed in the summary.	"Summary:
The text is a response to a New York Times column by Maureen Dowd regarding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's speech at an American Enterprise Institute dinner. The author contrasts Dowd's negative descriptors of Thomas's speech, such as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying,"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" with their own perception of it as inspiring. The author notes the attentive and enthusiastic reaction of the audience to Thomas's speech, which focused on themes of duty, honor, and country. Thomas also touched on his personal experiences with media portrayal and his controversial views on race-related issues such as affirmative action, school busing, and welfare. The author argues that Thomas's willingness to speak his truth despite expecting negative backlash exemplifies the courage he was advocating for. The author admires Thomas's journey from a challenging background to the Supreme Court and considers him to possess considerable courage and guts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text seems to support Clarence Thomas's critical stance on affirmative action. They mention that Thomas, as a black man, dares to question ""black"" issues such as affirmative action, implying that there is a general expectation within the black community to support such policies. The author also highlights Thomas's view that there is a lack of real debate or honest discussion on race issues, suggesting that those who question affirmative action or similar policies face accusations of bad form or treason. The author appears to align with the idea that it takes courage to challenge accepted wisdom, including the conventional wisdom surrounding affirmative action. Overall, the author seems to advocate for open debate on the topic and to respect Thomas's courage in questioning the status quo regarding affirmative action."	0.027419999999999996	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as indicated by their argument that diversity is a compelling national interest and essential for a comprehensive educational experience. They challenge the idea that admissions should be based solely on test scores and grades, suggesting that merit includes a variety of factors and that the context of a student's background is important. The author also believes that race-conscious admissions policies benefit all students and are necessary for fostering diversity. They advocate for the value of direct encounters with people from different backgrounds, especially in the context of a post-September 11 society that values pluralism.	"Summary:
The text discusses the heightened awareness and appreciation for diversity in the United States following the events of September 11, 2001. This newfound perspective has led to increased interest in international topics and languages at college campuses. The author explores the debate over affirmative action in college admissions, specifically the consideration of race and ethnicity to promote diversity, which has been the subject of conflicting court rulings. The diversity rationale has replaced the goal of remedying past racial discrimination as the primary argument for such policies. The text acknowledges the complexity of defining merit and the potential impact of race-blind policies on minority admissions. University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor is quoted, emphasizing the importance of diversity in higher education for understanding different perspectives. The author argues against the notion that a diverse set of ideas can exist without a diverse student body, advocating for the value of direct encounters with people who are different.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action policies in college admissions, viewing them as essential for fostering a diverse educational environment. The author suggests that diversity is a compelling national interest and that race-conscious admissions policies can benefit all students within an institution. The text challenges the idea that standardized test scores and grades should be the sole criteria for admissions, pointing out that merit can take many forms and that the context of a student's background should be considered. The author also cites evidence that students admitted through affirmative action may perform better at top-tier schools than their peers at less selective institutions. Overall, the author believes that direct encounters with diverse individuals are irreplaceable and necessary for a comprehensive educational experience, particularly in light of the renewed appreciation for pluralistic values post-September 11."	0.029029999999999997	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred through the context of the fraud scheme involving the Duff family. While the author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action, the critical viewpoint on the exploitation of affirmative action for corruption suggests a concern for the integrity of such programs. The focus on the misuse of affirmative action for personal gain by those with connections implies the author believes in the potential of affirmative action but is critical of its implementation and the lack of oversight. Therefore, the author seems somewhat in favor of affirmative action but against the corruption and manipulation associated with it.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the indictment of the Duff family, friends of the mayor of Chicago, in a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud scheme. The author, while waiting for a press conference by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, decides to have lunch at Gene & Georgetti's, a steakhouse popular with politicians and insiders. The author reflects on the history of corruption in Chicago politics, contrasting the media's treatment of the current white mayor with that of the late Mayor Harold Washington, who was black. The author criticizes the preferential treatment and corruption that allows the mayor's friends to profit from government contracts, emphasizing that it's the taxpayers' money that is being misused. The piece ends with the author and friends discussing the significance of having an independent federal prosecutor while receiving news of the Duff indictments at the steakhouse.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but it can be inferred through the context of the fraud scheme. The Duff family, who are white, were accused of running phony front companies to obtain city contracts that were intended for businesses owned by women or minorities. This suggests that the author may view affirmative action as a well-intended policy that can be exploited by those with connections and power, leading to corruption and the undermining of the policy's goals. The author's focus on the misuse of affirmative action as a tool for fraud indicates a concern for the integrity of such programs and the need for proper oversight and enforcement to ensure that the intended beneficiaries—women and minorities—are the ones who actually benefit."	0.02935	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text seems to recognize the necessity of affirmative action in addressing historical injustices and underrepresentation of minorities within the Chicago Fire Department. They emphasize the importance of fairness and the need for a culture of respect, suggesting that affirmative action is a valuable tool for fostering such an environment. Despite acknowledging that some white firefighters feel resentment towards affirmative action policies, the author condemns any form of bigotry and supports the principle of equal opportunity. The author's perspective on affirmative action is portrayed positively, as they advocate for it as a means to improve the department's culture and values.	"Summary:
The article discusses a series of racist incidents involving the Chicago Fire Department, where firefighters have used racial slurs over radio frequencies and at a firehouse retirement party. These incidents are part of a longer history of racial tension within the department, which only began integrating in 1968. The Fire Commissioner, James Joyce, and Mayor Richard Daley have both stated that such behavior will not be tolerated and could lead to dismissal. Identifying the perpetrators is challenging due to the potential for hacking and electronic interference. The article suggests that firefighters who do not condone racism should lead the effort to improve the department's culture and that those who cannot respect the diverse public they serve should resign.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action within the Chicago Fire Department as a necessary measure to ensure fairness and address the historical underrepresentation of minorities. They acknowledge that affirmative action has caused resentment among some white firefighters who feel that promotions of minorities are unfair to them. However, the author strongly criticizes any firefighter who allows their frustration to manifest as bigotry. The author believes that adding fairness to the department's values, through affirmative action, is essential despite the resistance it may face. They advocate for a culture of respect and public service, suggesting that those who cannot align with these values should not be part of the department."	0.0279	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion of the fraudulent acquisition of affirmative action contracts by the Duff family, along with the mention of the firefighters' union's opposition to racial preferences, indicates a critical view of affirmative action. This skepticism seems rooted in concerns about the misuse and potential unfairness of affirmative action policies. The author does not outright condemn affirmative action but instead points out the complexities and challenges it faces in practice, which suggests a nuanced, if not somewhat negative, stance on the policy.	"Summary:
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley appointed a new Fire Commissioner, Cortez Trotter, who is both the first black man and the first from the paramedic side to lead the predominantly white fire department. This move comes amid racial controversies and accusations of racial slurs used by firefighters. Trotter emphasized the importance of addressing diversity issues within the department and warned against any intolerance. The author suggests that Trotter's appointment is a strategic move by Daley to protect his political interests, especially with the upcoming trial of the Duff family, who are accused of fraudulently obtaining affirmative action contracts. Trotter faces the challenge of earning the respect of firefighters and managing the department's transition, with a focus on affirmative action policies and reconciling paramedic and firefighter relations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least in the context of how it has been exploited in Chicago. They reference a case where white individuals, the Duffs, fraudulently obtained contracts meant for minority-owned businesses, suggesting a misuse of affirmative action policies. The author also highlights the opposition of the firefighters' union to racial preferences, which may complicate Trotter's efforts to implement affirmative action within the department. The perspective given indicates a skepticism about the effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action, especially when considering the potential for abuse and the resistance from existing power structures."	0.025519999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author displays a critical and cynical view towards the implementation of affirmative action, specifically in the context of its abuse by individuals who are not part of genuine minority groups. Their sarcasm and criticism of the Duffs and the city hall for allowing such exploitation suggest a negative view of how affirmative action is being applied rather than the principle itself. The author does not explicitly state opposition to the concept of affirmative action but rather to its manipulation and the failure of the system to prevent such abuses.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on a situation involving Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, who was the purchasing agent for Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley for 11 years and was involved in political deals. The author describes a brief phone call with Grzyb, who claimed ignorance about the Duffs and Waste Management's involvement in a Blue Bag recycling contract. The Duffs, who are white, allegedly obtained $100 million in affirmative action contracts by pretending to be minorities. Grzyb, no longer working for the city, deflects questions to the city's press office. The mayor, too, refuses to comment on the matter, which is under federal investigation. The author sarcastically questions the legitimacy of the Duffs' claim to minority status and criticizes the city hall for allowing such a deal.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and cynical, particularly in the context of the alleged abuse of the system by the Duffs through their connection with Mayor Daley. The author seems to question the integrity of affirmative action when it is manipulated by individuals who are not genuine minorities but use the system to gain lucrative contracts. The sarcastic tone at the end of the text, questioning whether white individuals like the Duffs should be able to claim minority status, indicates the author's skepticism towards how affirmative action can be exploited by those with political connections, rather than serving its intended purpose of helping actual disadvantaged minority groups."	0.02757	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, Clarence Page, discusses John H. Johnson's philosophy of making oneself indispensable through unique skills and value, suggesting a preference for individual merit over race-based preferential treatment. This perspective is illustrated by referencing Matthew Henson's hiring due to his indispensable knowledge rather than an affirmative action plan. The author's emphasis on personal initiative and excellence, as well as the suggestion that affirmative action should not be a primary factor in hiring decisions, indicates a belief in meritocracy. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, favoring individual competencies over affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
John H. Johnson, a pioneering black publisher who passed away at age 87, was renowned for his successful business philosophy encapsulated in the advice, ""Make yourself indispensable."" His publications, including Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, were essential for black Americans, advertisers, and journalists, particularly black journalists, by providing representation, employment, and a model for diverse coverage beyond stereotypical narratives. Johnson's autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" offers insights into overcoming adversity, as exemplified by his and his mother's perseverance in the face of educational and financial challenges. Johnson's strategic relationships, such as with Zenith Electronics, and his understanding of consumer needs, underscore his business acumen and the importance of providing value, service, and quality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clarence Page, uses the story of John H. Johnson to illustrate a perspective on affirmative action that emphasizes individual merit and the importance of making oneself indispensable through unique skills and value. By referencing the story of Matthew Henson, who was hired not because of an affirmative action plan but because of his indispensable knowledge of the Inuit language, Page suggests that Johnson valued the principle of earning one's position through demonstrated ability and contribution. Johnson's own success story, as well as his advice to aspiring journalists, reflects a belief in the power of personal initiative and excellence over any form of preferential treatment based on race. The author appears to advocate for a merit-based approach to success, implying that affirmative action should not be a primary factor in hiring decisions, but rather the unique competencies and indispensability of an individual."	0.028499999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary. The text only mentions that affirmative action was a topic of discussion in the presidential debate without offering any insight into the author's personal views or analysis on the matter. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not addressed in the summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the dynamics of the 2004 U.S. presidential race, characterizing it as a polarized contest between those who either love or hate President George W. Bush. The author notes that while there is no strong enthusiasm for John Kerry, he has demonstrated superior debating skills. The final debate covered contentious issues such as abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, faith, taxes, health care, and education, highlighting the stark differences between the two candidates. Bush was seen as having to defend his record, particularly on the economy and job losses due to outsourcing. Kerry focused on themes of class warfare and aimed to appeal to women voters on the issue of abortion rights. Both candidates had prepared attack lines, but these were not deemed very effective. The article suggests that personal connection is crucial in elections, with Bush showing more warmth, particularly when speaking about his wife, while Kerry was more steady and dispassionate. The debates have been important for Kerry in gaining credibility, and the final debate marked the last major national event before the election. The author points out that incumbents who do not perform well in debates typically do not fare well on Election Day.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The text only mentions that the final debate between President Bush and Senator Kerry included affirmative action as one of the key issues, indicating that it is a significant and divisive topic in American politics. The author focuses more on the overall performance and strategies of the candidates rather than providing a personal opinion on affirmative action or other specific policy issues."	0.03073	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to be critical of the implementation of affirmative action, evidenced by their focus on the satirical actions of students mocking these policies and the suggestion that such policies can be divisive and open to ridicule. The author's reference to the 'purported silliness' of affirmative action and the broader culture of political correctness indicates a skeptical view of the current practices. However, the author also shows concern for the hurt caused by such satirical actions, suggesting a nuanced position that recognizes the potential for harm in both affirmative action policies and the actions that mock them. The author's perspective is not outright opposition to the concept of affirmative action but rather a criticism of how it can be misapplied or lead to absurd situations. Therefore, the author's stance is likely 'somewhat against' affirmative action as currently practiced, with an emphasis on the need for respectful discourse.	"Summary:
The text discusses the satirical actions taken by some students at Columbia College Chicago to mock what they perceive as the excessive political correctness in American academia. The students are considering organizing events such as an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" where prices are determined by race, and a ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant"" game, to highlight and ridicule the concept of race-based discrimination, even if it's meant to be favorable. The author points out that while these activities may not be illegal, they can be hurtful, as illustrated by the incident involving Don Imus and the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The author suggests that ignoring such provocative acts may be a more effective response than forming committees or drafting policies that might inadvertently underscore an obsession with political correctness.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action, at least as it is practiced in a way that can be mocked by the proposed ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale."" The author implies that such policies, intended to discriminate favorably on the basis of race, can be seen as ""purported silliness"" and are part of the broader culture of political correctness that the students are challenging. The mention of the bake sale and the immigrant game suggests that the author views these affirmative action policies as potentially divisive and open to ridicule. However, the author also acknowledges the pain that can be caused by such satirical actions, as shown in the reference to the hurt caused by Don Imus' comments. The author's perspective seems to be that while affirmative action and political correctness are well-intentioned, they can lead to absurd outcomes and deserve to be critiqued, albeit in a way that does not cause unnecessary harm."	0.02668	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Charles Krauthammer, does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action within the summary provided. Instead, he acknowledges the importance of the presidential campaign process in fostering debates that can lead to shifts in policy, such as the move from race-based to class-based preferences suggested by Barack Obama. Krauthammer's appreciation for the campaign's role in policy evolution does not reveal his own position on affirmative action, as he neither endorses nor criticizes the policy itself or the suggestion made by Obama.	"Summary:
The text discusses the prolonged nature of American presidential campaigns compared to other countries like Britain and Canada. The author, Charles Krauthammer, suggests that the length of the campaigns, though not planned, serves three important functions. First, it tests the organizational skills of candidates, which is crucial for managing the federal government. Second, it fosters party consensus and democratic legitimacy, allowing for intraparty dialogue and competition. Third, it satisfies the American preference for egalitarianism by putting candidates through a physically and spiritually demanding process, which the public sees as a necessary ordeal before granting them the power and prestige of the presidency. Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist, acknowledges the managerial and consensus-building benefits of the campaign process but expresses particular appreciation for the humbling experience it forces upon presidential hopefuls.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Krauthammer's perspective on affirmative action is briefly touched upon in the context of the presidential campaign's ability to provoke debate and potentially lead to a shift in national consensus. He notes Barack Obama's suggestion during a television interview to move away from race-based preferences to class-based preferences. Krauthammer does not explicitly state his own view but implies that such discussions during the campaign could lead to significant debates within the Democratic Party and possibly result in a new national consensus on affirmative action. The author seems to recognize the value of the campaign in bringing such issues to the forefront and in contributing to the evolution of policy and party platforms."	0.02651	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the role of affirmative action in Lewis Hamilton's career but points out that Hamilton's success is primarily due to his talent and hard work. While affirmative action is mentioned, it is suggested to have played a minor role in creating an opportunity for Hamilton. The author's perspective appears to be that affirmative action is justifiable in certain contexts to level the playing field, but ultimately, individual merit is the key factor in success. The author's stance is not heavily weighed towards either support or opposition of affirmative action, but rather presents it as a nuanced factor in the broader context of Hamilton's achievements.	"Summary:
The text discusses the early career of Lewis Hamilton, Formula One's first black driver, who made a remarkable start to his F1 career with impressive performances in his rookie season. At 22 years old, Hamilton placed third in the Grand Prix of Australia and second in the Malaysia Grand Prix, with expectations of a potential victory in the upcoming Bahrain Grand Prix. The article highlights Hamilton's skillful driving, particularly in Malaysia, where he outmaneuvered Ferrari drivers and supported his McLaren teammate, Fernando Alonso, by holding off the competition. Hamilton's success is attributed to his talent and a developmental contract with McLaren and Mercedes-Benz that he signed at age 13. The article also mentions a slight element of affirmative action in Hamilton's rise, but emphasizes that his achievements are primarily due to his own skill and hard work. The departure of Juan Pablo Montoya from F1 to NASCAR is noted as an ironic twist that opened up a spot at McLaren for Hamilton.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action in a positive light, suggesting that it played a minor but fair role in Hamilton's career in the ""unspeakably expensive world of international formula racing."" The mention of affirmative action implies that it may have helped create an opportunity for Hamilton, but the author quickly points out that Hamilton's subsequent success is largely of his own making. The use of the phrase ""just enough to be fair"" indicates that the author believes affirmative action can play a justifiable part in leveling the playing field, especially in a sport where financial barriers are significant. However, the author clearly believes that Hamilton's talent, dedication, and the early support from McLaren and Mercedes-Benz are the primary factors behind his impressive entry into Formula One racing."	0.029169999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's reference to affirmative action is used to underscore a point about political hypocrisy and manipulation, rather than to express a direct opinion on affirmative action itself. The anecdote about Chicago politics is employed to illustrate a broader theme of cronyism rather than to make a specific argument for or against affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text and seems to be more of an illustrative point within their critique of political practices. Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively categorize the author's view on affirmative action as the text does not provide enough direct commentary on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The author criticizes President Barack Obama for a joke he made on ""The Tonight Show"" about the Special Olympics, which was overshadowed by his reaction to the AIG executive bonuses. Obama expressed surprise at the $165 million in bonuses given to AIG executives, which were known by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner weeks before the public outcry. The author suggests that the Democrats are feigning outrage for political cover and accuses them of being aware of the bonuses well in advance. The piece likens Washington politics to the ""Chicago Way,"" implying cronyism and backroom deals, and mocks the media for their adoration of Obama, using the term ""Hopium"" to describe their perceived intoxication with hope and change. The author also criticizes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her response to the AIG situation and her use of government transportation, suggesting that the outrage is a distraction from the Democrats' complicity in the AIG bonus issue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and cynical. He references a situation where Chicago Mayor Richard Daley was ""stunned"" to learn that $100 million in affirmative action contracts went to white men he knew well, rather than to black females, as was presumably intended. This anecdote is used to illustrate a broader theme of political hypocrisy and manipulation, suggesting that affirmative action, in this instance, was not implemented as it was meant to be, but rather was exploited for the benefit of those with connections. The author's tone implies a belief that affirmative action can be subverted by those in power for their own gains, casting doubt on the integrity and effectiveness of such policies."	0.030680000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author describes the IMPACT initiative, which aims to increase diversity on the boards of non-profit organizations, in a positive light. They acknowledge the challenges in achieving diversity due to systemic issues and emphasize that the program ensures that candidates are highly qualified. The author's presentation of affirmative action as a strategic and necessary approach to address underrepresentation suggests a supportive stance. They highlight the importance of leveraging the unique perspectives of minority leaders and the program's success in doing so, without implying any lowering of standards.	"Summary:
Phyllis Lockett, an African-American woman with impressive credentials, was recruited by executive recruiter Charles Tribbett III to join the board of a major cultural institution in Chicago. This was part of a broader initiative, called IMPACT, which aimed to diversify the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits by placing highly qualified minorities in board positions. The program, funded by the Joyce Foundation, Boeing Co., and The Chicago Community Trust, spent about $400,000 to place nine minorities on boards over three years. Despite challenges such as a small pool of minority candidates with the necessary job titles and wealth, the need to persuade institutions to participate, and the economic recession, the program succeeded in adding seven blacks, one Hispanic, and one Native American to six boards. All IMPACT candidates met annual giving requirements, and the initiative aimed to create a snowball effect, with the new board members helping to recruit more diverse candidates in the future.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action in a positive light, highlighting the proactive efforts to increase diversity within the boards of non-profit organizations. The text acknowledges the challenges and systemic issues that have led to a lack of diversity, such as the small pool of minority candidates in high-level positions and the dominance of white men in corporate boardrooms. The author also points out the efforts made by the IMPACT program to ensure that the candidates were not just fulfilling a diversity quota but were highly qualified peers, as emphasized by Lyndon Taylor, who stated, ""There was no affirmative action."" This suggests that the author views affirmative action not as a lower standard or a mere checklist but as a necessary and strategic approach to address the underrepresentation of minorities in leadership roles. The program's approach to recruiting diverse candidates is seen as a corrective measure to the existing imbalances and as a way to leverage the unique perspectives and contributions of minority leaders."	0.03007	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author emphasizes the complexity of Martin Luther King Jr.'s views and suggests that both proponents and opponents of affirmative action have misused King's words. The author is critical of the 'dangerous ideological revisionism' that occurs when King's remarks are taken out of context for political debates. There is no clear indication that the author themselves holds a strong position for or against affirmative action; rather, they appear to advocate for a nuanced understanding of King's perspective.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing the complexity of his views and the practical solutions he proposed in his lesser-known work, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"" The author cautions against misappropriating King's words for contemporary political debates, such as those around California's Proposition 209 on affirmative action. The text outlines King's multifaceted approach to issues like the black family crisis, educational neglect, political apathy, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare. Despite the mixed success and reception of his ideas, the author argues that King's vision remains more substantive than the superficial efforts of many current politicians and community leaders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that both proponents and opponents of affirmative action have misused Martin Luther King Jr.'s words in debates over policies like California's Proposition 209. This misuse is described as ""dangerous ideological revisionism."" The text implies that King's actual position on affirmative action is not easily categorized and that his few remarks on the topic should not be taken out of context or distorted. The author seems to advocate for a nuanced understanding of King's views, rather than simplifying them to fit a particular political agenda."	0.026180000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly detailed in terms of support or opposition. Instead, the author situates the topic within a broader narrative of California's history of political scapegoating and the cynical view that journalists may develop when covering such repetitive issues. The text implies a critical stance towards the politicization of affirmative action, rather than the policy itself, suggesting that the author is more concerned with how affirmative action is used in political discourse rather than the policy's merits or drawbacks. Therefore, the author does not express a clear position in favor of or against affirmative action, but rather seems to be commenting on the political manipulation of the issue.	"Summary:
The text presents a vivid portrayal of California as a land of constant change yet paradoxically marked by recurring themes and issues. It describes the state's natural volatility, with its earthquakes, floods, and droughts, and its cultural dynamism, with new trends and celebrities always emerging. However, the author points out that certain issues, such as water scarcity and political scapegoating of various groups (from Chinese laborers in the mid-1800s to affirmative action beneficiaries), seem to be perpetual. The text also reflects on the weariness journalists can feel when covering these recurring stories, which can lead to cynicism. Looking ahead, the author humorously predicts that future headlines will still be dominated by the same old stories, from water wars to political recounts, and from celebrity gossip to urban planning woes.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is presented within a broader commentary on the cyclical nature of California's political scapegoating. The text suggests a degree of skepticism about the political process, where affirmative action beneficiaries are lumped together with other groups that have been targeted over time as the ""Other"" to campaign against. This implies a critical view of how affirmative action is used as a political wedge issue rather than being discussed on its own merits. The author seems to view the debate around affirmative action as part of a repetitive pattern where complex social issues are simplified into political soundbites, which can be exploited for electoral gain. The mention of affirmative action in this context suggests that the author may see the policy as misunderstood or misrepresented in the political arena, and possibly as a recurring theme in California's political landscape that is subject to the same cycles of controversy and scapegoating as other issues."	0.02991	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not directly state their position on affirmative action within the provided summary. Instead, they refer to the issue in the context of how it has been historically used as a political tool to exploit public fears and anxieties. The text suggests that in an era of optimism, the potency of such issues to agitate the public diminishes. Since the author's stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, we can only infer that they are discussing it in terms of its political utility rather than expressing a personal viewpoint on the policy itself.	"Summary:
This text discusses the resurgence of American optimism in the late 1990s, after a long period where the majority of Americans felt the country was on the wrong track. The author attributes this renewed optimism to a strong economy, low unemployment, shrinking federal budget deficit, declining crime rates, and stabilization of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth rates. The United States is once again seen as a leader in shaping the future, with cities like Seattle, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley driving technological and cultural advancements. The author notes that this optimism has reduced public hostility and the effectiveness of political agendas that rely on fear and anxiety. However, the author also warns against complacency, highlighting that the nation still faces challenges such as poor education, low wages for low-skilled workers, and the costs of an aging population. The author suggests that the current prosperity should be used to invest in long-term growth and to address social issues, rather than settling for short-term contentment.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the broader context of the text. The author mentions that for years, conservatives have pointed fingers at various societal elements, including affirmative action, as explanations for the anxiety felt by many Americans. However, in the current climate of optimism, these ""demons"" are losing their potency to agitate the public. This suggests that the author sees affirmative action as one of several political issues that have historically been used to rally support by playing on public fears and anxieties. In the context of a more optimistic society, the urgency and hostility towards affirmative action and other conservative targets appear to be waning. The author does not explicitly endorse or criticize affirmative action but instead comments on how it has been utilized within the political landscape and how its role may change in an era of increased optimism."	0.03259	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights enforcement, referencing Justice Ginsburg's dissent, and emphasis on the importance of enforcing laws to promote equality, indicates a supportive stance towards affirmative action. The author believes in the necessity of addressing racial inequality and discrimination through active measures. The acknowledgment of persistent racial barriers and the need for increased funding to civil rights agencies further demonstrate a belief in the importance of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights enforcement to ensure impartial decision-making by employers, contractors, mortgage lenders, and landlords. It acknowledges the persistence of racial barriers and cites Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent on a 1995 affirmative action decision, highlighting ongoing discrimination in employment, housing, and consumer markets. The White House plan would increase civil rights funding by 17%, aiming to strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by reducing its case backlog and promoting mediation. Additionally, the Justice Department's civil rights division would receive an 11% funding boost, and the Housing and Urban Development Department would get additional funds to hire more ""testers"" to uncover housing discrimination. President Clinton's initiative is part of a broader effort to engage the nation in a dialogue on race, emphasizing that enforcing civil rights laws is crucial to providing equal opportunities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be in favor of affirmative action, as indicated by the reference to Justice Ginsburg's eloquent dissent, which underscores the need to address racial inequality and discrimination's lingering effects. The author questions the logic of affirmative action opponents who claim to support equal opportunity yet may oppose the enforcement of laws that promote equality. The author believes that strict and timely enforcement of civil rights laws is essential to giving everyone a fair chance, suggesting that action is more important than dialogue alone in resolving issues of racial discrimination and inequality."	0.02116	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed in the text. The discussion of affirmative action is limited to its role as a political issue in the context of a candidate's potential appeal to voters. The author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action but instead comments on its relevance in the political landscape. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be accurately determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the importance of having a strong desire or ""fire in the belly"" when it comes to both sports and politics. The text discusses the California gubernatorial race, noting that three potential candidates with star power did not enter the race, leaving four others who did demonstrate the requisite eagerness and courage to compete. The author briefly discusses each of the remaining candidates, including Republican Dan Lungren and Democrats Gray Davis, Al Checchi, and Jane Harman, emphasizing their readiness to fight for the governorship. The author also comments on those who did not run, such as Dianne Feinstein, Leon Panetta, and Richard Riordan, providing reasons for their decisions to stay out of the race. The piece concludes by urging people to focus on the candidates who are willing to run and to make a choice among them.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text, but it is mentioned in the context of critiquing Richard Riordan. The author notes that Riordan, who decided not to run for governor, did not support the anti-affirmative action initiatives, which could have made him a less appealing candidate to some Republican voters. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as a contentious political issue that can influence a candidate's chances in a primary, particularly within the Republican Party. However, the text does not provide a detailed opinion on the policy itself, only its potential impact on political campaigning and voter preferences."	0.027139999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author, Herschel Rosenthal, does not directly state his personal stance on affirmative action. Instead, he discusses the impact of deteriorating personal relationships among legislators on their ability to handle sensitive issues like affirmative action with sensitivity and understanding. Although he implies that a more connected legislature could better address such issues, he does not explicitly endorse or oppose affirmative action itself. His focus is on the process and the atmosphere in which such policies are debated, rather than on the policies themselves. Therefore, his perspective on affirmative action is not clearly in favor or against, but rather concerned with the social dynamics that influence the policy-making process.	"Summary:
Herschel Rosenthal, a long-serving state legislator, reflects on the changes he has witnessed in the California state Capitol over his 24-year tenure. He notes positive developments, such as increased public involvement in state policy and a Legislature that better mirrors the state's diversity. However, he laments the decline in personal relationships among legislators, which he believes has made the job less enjoyable and more challenging in terms of reaching consensus on policy matters. Rosenthal recalls the past camaraderie, with legislators from different parties socializing and engaging in activities like softball games and lunches at the Derby Club. He contrasts this with the current atmosphere, where bipartisan socializing is rare, and debates have become more hostile. He attributes this shift to various factors, including the coarsening of public discourse, term limits, and competitive districts. Rosenthal argues that the deterioration of interpersonal relationships among legislators has negatively impacted the handling of sensitive issues like affirmative action, bilingual education, and immigration, often leading to debates lacking sensitivity and understanding. Emphasizing the importance of personal connections in a diverse society, he advocates for legislators to make an effort to get to know each other beyond the political arena.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Herschel Rosenthal, views affirmative action within the broader context of deteriorating relationships and heightened partisanship in the California Legislature. He expresses concern over the ""disturbing racial undertones"" of recent ballot measures concerning affirmative action and other issues related to cultural and racial backgrounds. Rosenthal suggests that the lack of personal relationships and understanding among legislators from different cultural or racial backgrounds has led to debates on these issues that are insensitive and lack mutual understanding. His perspective implies that a more harmonious and personally connected Legislature would be better equipped to handle affirmative action and similar policies with the necessary sensitivity and depth."	0.028	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action in helping people of color join the middle class but criticizes its limitations in aiding those in the working and poverty classes. They argue for a broader strategy that includes class analysis and structural economic changes, indicating recognition of affirmative action's role but also its insufficiency. The author's perspective is nuanced, recognizing the value of affirmative action while advocating for additional measures to combat racism across different economic classes.	"Summary:
The text discusses President Bill Clinton's initiative to engage Americans in a conversation about race, with a focus on supporting affirmative action. The author acknowledges that affirmative action has helped more people of color join the middle class, but argues that it has done little for those in the working and poverty classes. The article traces the history of the civil rights movement, noting the shift in focus from political and legal rights to economic strategies, including the co-optation of civil rights organizations by corporate interests and the redefinition of ""black power"" as black capitalism. The author criticizes the failure of black capitalism to end racism and points out the need for a class analysis to address the needs of poor people of color. The text calls for a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism that recognizes the different experiences of racism across economic classes and suggests that legal changes alone will not help those in the poverty class, advocating for broader employment opportunities and social support.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a policy that has had some positive effects, such as increasing the number of professionals of color in various fields. However, they believe that affirmative action has limitations, particularly in addressing the economic challenges faced by poor people of color. The author suggests that while affirmative action can provide indirect benefits, such as role models and challenging stereotypes, it is not a replacement for more direct measures that tackle the effects of racism on the economically disadvantaged. The perspective presented is that affirmative action is a necessary but insufficient tool in the fight against racism, and it should be part of a broader strategy that includes class analysis and addresses structural economic issues."	0.0322	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on the political careers of Latino politicians in California and mentions Rod Pacheco's support for Proposition 209, which ended state racial preferences. However, because the author does not offer their own views on the matter, it is not possible to categorize their stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The article discusses the rise of Latino political figures in California, highlighting the election of Cruz Bustamante as the first Latino Assembly speaker and later as lieutenant governor, and Antonio Villaraigosa as his successor and potential mayoral candidate for Los Angeles. The focus then shifts to Rod Pacheco, a Republican Latino who has been elected as the Assembly's minority leader, marking a significant shift as Latino Republicans gain more seats. Pacheco is characterized as a centrist, former prosecutor, and a social moderate who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187 (anti-illegal immigration initiative), but supported Proposition 209 (ending state racial preferences). The Republican Party is portrayed as needing to recover from negative associations with previous anti-immigrant policies and is looking to Pacheco as a potential bridge to Latino voters. Pacheco himself expresses a desire for the GOP to focus on issues like safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation, and better schools to attract Latino support. However, he is hesitant to be used as a mere recruiting tool for the party.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that Rod Pacheco supported Proposition 209, which aimed to end state racial preferences, aligning with the view that affirmative action should be abolished. This suggests that Pacheco, and possibly the author, believe in a merit-based system rather than one that gives preferential treatment based on race. The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action but provides information on Pacheco's stance as part of his political profile."	0.02716	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text discusses affirmative action as an issue that has seen a decline in voter urgency due to legislative actions. There is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the policy itself; the text merely points out its relevance in the political arena and how it has been overshadowed by other concerns. The author's perspective is presented in a detached manner, without expressing support or opposition to affirmative action, focusing instead on its role in the political landscape and voter concerns.	"Summary:
The text discusses the shifting priorities of California voters and the political focus of state leaders. Education has been a dominant issue, with politicians like Governor Gray Davis and former Governor Pete Wilson gaining favor by advocating for education reform. However, pollster Steve Kinney predicts that education will soon be eclipsed by other concerns such as health care and infrastructure, especially if the economy remains strong. Kinney's polling method involves measuring the intensity of concern among voters on a scale of one to ten, focusing only on the highest level of concern. He notes that issues like illegal immigration, affirmative action, and crime have lost their urgency among voters after significant legislative actions were taken. Despite the prediction of education's decline in importance, recent reports of California's poor fourth-grade reading skills suggest that the issue may not fade as quickly as expected. Other politicians, like Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and Senate leader John Burton, are beginning to address issues like health care and transportation, indicating a shift in legislative priorities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly provide a personal perspective on affirmative action but mentions it in the context of issues that have lost political momentum. The author notes that affirmative action was a hot issue that cooled down after the passage of Proposition 209, which effectively ended affirmative action in public institutions in California. This observation suggests that the author views affirmative action as a topic that can generate significant political engagement but also one that can diminish in importance once legislative action is perceived to address it. The author's focus is more on the political lifecycle of issues rather than on affirmative action as a policy."	0.02789	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author does not directly express a stance on affirmative action policies in society at large but does discuss the efforts of Jim Brulte to diversify the Republican Party by supporting the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This indicates a recognition of the value of diversity within the party's ranks, which parallels the goals of affirmative action without explicitly endorsing or opposing affirmative action policies. The author's perspective is conveyed through the discussion of Brulte's actions rather than through a clear endorsement or criticism of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The article criticizes the California Republican Party for lacking strong leadership and potential candidates for key political positions. It describes the GOP's absence from top state positions, such as governor, U.S. senator, and state attorney general, which are all held by Democrats. The piece mentions two statewide elected Republicans facing challenges: Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush is involved in a scandal, and Secretary of State Bill Jones has fallen out of favor with GOP donors. However, the article highlights Jim Brulte, the new state Senate minority leader, as a respected and politically savvy figure within the party. Brulte has a history of political involvement, dating back to his childhood support for Ronald Reagan, and has held various political roles, including an unsuccessful bid to become Assembly speaker due to party defections. He is seen as a pragmatic leader who seeks legislative compromise rather than ideological battles, avoiding divisive issues like abortion and gun control. Brulte has invested in diversifying the party by funding the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. Despite the GOP's challenges in California, Brulte remains optimistic about its future and has improved the party's financial standing as its finance chairman.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author portrays Brulte as someone who avoids getting entangled in contentious issues, including affirmative action. However, Brulte is described as having his own approach to affirmative action within the party, which involves actively supporting and funding the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This suggests that while Brulte may not engage in public debates over affirmative action policies, he recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within the party's ranks and takes practical steps to address it. The author's perspective seems to align with Brulte's, recognizing the value of such efforts in a political landscape where the GOP is struggling to connect with a diverse electorate."	0.03014	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's mention of affirmative action is brief and lacks depth, focusing more on its role in defining Governor Davis's political alignment rather than on the policy itself. The author's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is part of a suite of policies that move away from the political center, which suggests a critical view of the policy as it is used to characterize Davis's governance as left-leaning. However, the author does not provide a clear or explicit stance for or against affirmative action in the text, instead using it to critique Davis's political positioning. Therefore, it is difficult to categorically define the author's stance on affirmative action itself without further context or explicit commentary on the policy.	"Summary:
The article discusses California Governor Gray Davis's decision to sign legislation requiring overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, making California one of only two states to have such a law. The author suggests that this move reveals Davis's governance to be less centrist than he claims, pointing to his left-leaning legislative actions and appointments. The author also notes that Davis has reintroduced a form of affirmative action at the University of California and opposes NAFTA, aligning with union interests. The author questions whether Davis will maintain his moderate image in the face of upcoming challenges on healthcare, gun control, and environmental issues. The author concedes that Davis is not a radical liberal but suggests that his administration is influenced by unions, trial lawyers, and regulatory expansionists.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as it relates to Governor Davis, seems critical. He mentions that Davis has ""orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of affirmative action at the University of California,"" implying that this action is part of a pattern of governance that leans away from the political center. The author's inclusion of this detail in a list of actions that challenge Davis's centrist claims suggests that he views the move towards affirmative action as indicative of a leftward political tilt. The author does not elaborate on the specifics of affirmative action policy or its implications but presents it as one of several issues that align with the interests of liberal activists and depart from Davis's purportedly moderate stance."	0.02666	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex and reflects a strong support for the program, tempered by an understanding of its evolution and the need for it to adapt to current social realities. The author's initial reaction to their son's essay shows a strong emotional investment in affirmative action, which is rooted in their own positive experiences with the program. Despite their son's argument against it, the author maintains that affirmative action is necessary for those who face social disadvantages, indicating a belief in its continued relevance. The author's approval of the new plan to broaden UC eligibility and the consideration of social factors in university admissions further demonstrates their support for measures that promote equality of opportunity. The author's stance evolves to embrace a more nuanced approach to affirmative action, one that still aims to help the disadvantaged but recognizes the need for the program to adapt to provide equal opportunities for everyone who works hard.	"Summary:
The essay discusses the author's initial reaction to their son Miguel's high school essay, which questions the value of affirmative action. Miguel, a Latino student, argues that despite potentially benefiting from affirmative action, he believes the program should be abolished. The author, a proponent of affirmative action who experienced its benefits firsthand during their time at UC Berkeley, is initially angered by their son's stance. However, upon reflection, the author acknowledges that Miguel, with his advantageous upbringing, might not need affirmative action to succeed. The author still believes in the program's importance for those with social disadvantages and notes that disparities still exist. They highlight a new plan to broaden UC eligibility to the top 4% of students from each high school, which could help underrepresented areas. The author concludes by mentioning that the university considers social factors in admissions and that success in the face of adversity is valued. After discussing with his father, Miguel revises his essay to recommend equal opportunity for everyone who works hard, aligning more closely with the author's perspective.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author strongly supports affirmative action based on their personal and historical understanding of the program's role in creating opportunities for minorities and reducing racial disparities. They have a nuanced view that recognizes both the successes and the limitations of affirmative action. While they initially balk at their son's call to abolish the program, they acknowledge that individuals like their son, who come from privileged backgrounds, may not need affirmative action to succeed. Nevertheless, the author maintains that the program is still necessary for those facing social disadvantages and that a focus on helping students from underrepresented areas is essential. They also appreciate efforts to address adversity through university admissions policies that consider social factors, suggesting a preference for a more targeted and equitable approach to supporting disadvantaged students rather than a blanket race-based policy. The author's perspective evolves to support a form of affirmative action that is more closely aligned with current social realities, aiming for a fair chance of success for all who strive for it."	0.03318	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Halford H. Fairchild, criticizes standardized testing, such as the SAT, for perpetuating racial, economic, and cultural inequalities and suggests that motivation and effort are better indicators of student success. He views affirmative action as a necessary tool to counteract the bias inherent in these tests and to correct the underrepresentation of minorities in higher education. Fairchild's advocacy for admissions criteria that reflect qualities like motivation and effort, and his criticism of figures like Ward Connerly who oppose affirmative action, indicate a clear support for affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'strongly in favor' of affirmative action.	"Summary:
Halford H. Fairchild, a professor of psychology and black studies at Pitzer College, criticizes the use of the SAT as a measure of merit for college admissions, arguing that it perpetuates racial, economic, and cultural inequalities. He points out that the SAT does not accurately predict college success and is biased against those who have not had access to the same educational resources as others. Fairchild also criticizes the use of other standardized tests like the SAT II, MCAT, LSAT, and GRE for similar reasons. He suggests that motivation and effort are better indicators of student success and calls for admissions criteria that reflect these qualities. He also advocates for the reallocation of resources towards expanding educational opportunities rather than maintaining exclusionary practices.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Halford H. Fairchild, views affirmative action as a necessary countermeasure to the inherent racism and bias in standardized testing, particularly the SAT. He criticizes Ward Connerly, a regent who led the movement to abolish affirmative action, for not recognizing that the SAT itself acts as a proxy for maintaining racial and economic privilege. Fairchild believes that the underrepresentation of minorities in higher education is exacerbated by biased admissions criteria and that affirmative action is a means to correct this imbalance. He argues for admissions procedures that fairly assess students' potential and drive, rather than perpetuating existing inequalities through biased testing. Fairchild's perspective is that affirmative action is not about giving unearned advantages but about leveling the playing field and allowing for a more equitable assessment of students from diverse backgrounds."	0.02801	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author acknowledges the historical contributions of black Republicans to the development of affirmative action, particularly highlighting Art Fletcher's role in the creation of the Philadelphia Plan. While the author does not explicitly state their current stance on affirmative action, they recognize it as a positive legacy and an important measure for creating job opportunities for minorities and women. The author's reflection on the changing motivations and values within the Republican Party, along with their personal decision to switch to the Democratic Party, suggests a respect for the principles of affirmative action, but without a clear, articulated support or opposition in the present context.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the challenges of being a black Republican, citing examples of prominent figures like Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice being showcased as symbols of diversity. The author grew up in a black Republican family and recounts a personal experience of being attacked by members of the John Birch Society. Despite witnessing the GOP's rejection of stronger civil rights measures, the author felt pride in their father's commitment to the party. The author notes that black Republicans historically prioritized self-reliance over identity politics and contributed to the black community through initiatives like Art Fletcher's Philadelphia Plan, which laid the groundwork for affirmative action. However, the author perceives that contemporary black Republicans often seek to provoke or take advantage of less competition within the party. The author, who was a Republican until their father's death in 1983, eventually realized that their political values had changed and left the party to become a Democrat, unlike their father, whose loyalty and contributions to the party were driven by a desire to make a difference for black people.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author views affirmative action as a positive legacy of past black Republicans, such as Art Fletcher, who worked within the Nixon administration to create the Philadelphia Plan. This plan was seen as a pioneering effort to increase job opportunities for minorities and women by setting hiring goals for federal contractors. The author implies that such measures were important for creating a more level playing field and acknowledges the contributions of earlier black Republicans to these efforts. However, the author does not discuss the current stance of black Republicans on affirmative action, instead focusing on the broader shift in motivations and values within the party."	0.02652	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Felicia Clark, expresses concern that the introduction of 57 multiethnic categories complicates and potentially undermines affirmative action and race-based programs. She views these programs as necessary to address historical injustices and promote equality. Her criticism of the new census categories reflects a belief that they serve conservative politics and dilute the political power of ethnic communities, which could weaken the impact of affirmative action. Clark's advocacy for sticking with traditional race categories until there is clarity on the need for new ones indicates a desire to protect the effectiveness of affirmative action policies. Therefore, her stance is one of defense of affirmative action against what she perceives as complicating factors introduced by the census changes.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark criticizes the 2000 census's introduction of 57 multiethnic categories, arguing that it complicates affirmative action and race-based programs rather than addressing past racial injustices. She contends that the new categories serve conservative politics and dilute the political power of ethnic communities. Clark points out the inconsistency in categorization, where lighter-skinned multiethnic individuals are grouped into one category, while those with darker skin tones are divided into many. She questions the criteria for racial categorization, especially in the context of her own heritage, which includes African American, white, and Native American ancestry. Clark suggests that socio-economic factors might be more relevant for modern political and economic analysis and urges ethnic groups to stick with traditional race categories until the government clarifies the need for the new ones.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Clark's perspective on affirmative action is one of defense and concern. She views affirmative action as a necessary tool to address historical injustices and promote equality. However, she believes that the introduction of the 57 multiethnic categories by the census undermines the effectiveness of such programs. By making it difficult to monitor, legislate, and interpret affirmative action policies, the new categories, in her view, hinder the progress toward rectifying past wrongs. Clark implies that affirmative action and race-based programs are already challenged by conservative politics, and the confusing census data exacerbates these challenges. She advocates for clarity and simplicity in racial categorization to preserve the integrity of affirmative action measures and to ensure that they serve their intended purpose of fostering equality and reparations for historically oppressed groups."	0.02464	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	0
0	strongly_against	The author, Edwin A. Locke, is described as being highly critical of affirmative action, suggesting that it undermines fairness, objectivity, and academic competence. He views standardized tests as objective measures of academic potential and believes that the move towards more holistic admissions criteria is a way to circumvent legal prohibitions against race-based admissions. Locke's perspective is that affirmative action harms both students and universities by discriminating against those who are academically qualified and by eroding the integrity of the educational system.	"Summary:
The Board of Regents of the University of California has introduced new admissions policies that de-emphasize academic qualifications in favor of a more holistic approach, considering factors like athletic ability and overcoming adversity. Supporters state that these policies are not intended to reintroduce race-based admissions. However, the author, Edwin A. Locke, argues that the real intention behind these changes is to eliminate fairness and objectivity from the admissions process. Locke contends that standardized tests like the SAT are objective measures that are now being dismissed in favor of subjective criteria, which could hide political agendas and make it difficult for students to understand how to prepare for college admission. He believes that the changes are motivated by an egalitarian desire to undermine academic competence, which could harm both students and universities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Edwin A. Locke is highly critical of affirmative action and the recent changes to the University of California's admissions policies. He views affirmative action as a departure from merit-based criteria, which he believes are the fairest and most objective way to assess academic potential. Locke suggests that the shift towards subjective admissions criteria is a way to reintroduce race into the admissions process despite legal prohibitions, under the guise of a more ""holistic"" approach. He is concerned that this will lead to discrimination against academically qualified students who may not fit the desired profiles and that it will ultimately undermine the concept of academic competence. Locke's perspective is that affirmative action and similar policies are detrimental to the integrity of the educational system and to the individuals who are most deserving of admission based on their academic achievements."	0.02529	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in terms of being for or against it. The focus is on Rehnquist's tenure and his approach to various issues, including affirmative action. The text describes Rehnquist's opinions on affirmative action as 'sparse,' which has resulted in uncertainty regarding the court's stance on the issue. The author seems to be more concerned with the lack of clear guidance from the Supreme Court under Rehnquist's tenure rather than expressing a personal stance on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
This text provides an overview of the influence and legacy of several Chief Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on William H. Rehnquist's tenure. John Marshall established judicial review with Marbury vs. Madison, while Earl Warren was notable for advancing racial equality and defendants' rights. Rehnquist, appointed in 1972, had a mixed record, generally slowing but not reversing civil rights expansions. He emphasized states' rights, limiting federal authority, and was skeptical about the protection of private behavior by law. His successes included narrowing protections for criminal suspects and others, while his failures included an inability to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Rehnquist's management style was efficient but his sparse opinions left much uncertainty, particularly regarding affirmative action and the rights of terrorism suspects. His most controversial decision was in Bush vs. Gore, which the author views as an example of judicial activism. The text also mentions Rehnquist's battle with cancer and the potential implications for the court's future.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author suggests that Rehnquist's perspective on affirmative action was unclear and unpredictable. Rehnquist's opinions, described as often sparse, did not establish clear principles to guide future rulings on affirmative action. This has left the court's stance on the matter ambiguous, with the author indicating that it's anyone's guess as to how the court will rule on any given affirmative action program. This indicates that the author views Rehnquist as not providing a strong or clear direction for the court on the issue of affirmative action, contributing to a sense of uncertainty and lack of guidance for judges and lawmakers."	0.02954	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, David Gelernter, expresses skepticism about the ongoing justification for affirmative action, implying that it may no longer be necessary and criticizing Democrats for not re-evaluating it. His reference to the long-standing existence of affirmative action and the questioning of its indefinite continuation suggest that he believes the policy should be reconsidered. Although he does not explicitly state his full position on affirmative action, his critical tone toward the policy and the Democrats' reluctance to change it indicates a stance that leans against its persistence in its current form.	"Summary:
David Gelernter, a Yale professor and senior fellow at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, argues that the traditional political roles of Democrats and Republicans have reversed. He criticizes Senator Charles Schumer for suggesting that Republicans want to return to the policies of the 1930s or 1890s, labeling such claims as nonsense. Gelernter contends that Democrats have become the party of ""reactionary liberalism,"" resistant to change and progress, while Republicans are the new progressives. He accuses Democrats of wanting to maintain the status quo, opposing school vouchers, United Nations reform, and alterations to Social Security. Gelernter also challenges the Democrats' stance on democracy, criticizing their opposition to federal judge appointments by a Republican president and their reluctance to let the public decide on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. He questions whether the persistence of affirmative action is still justified and suggests that the current political confusion is clarified by recognizing this ""Big Switch"" in party roles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, appears to be critical of affirmative action, implying that it may have outlived its usefulness. He points out that there are tenured professors who have never experienced a world without affirmative action, suggesting that it has been in place for a long time. Gelernter’s mention of ""30 years of affirmative action"" could be interpreted as questioning whether it should continue indefinitely. His critique of Democrats for their hands-off approach and resistance to re-evaluating affirmative action indicates that he believes it is time to reconsider the policy and its current role in society."	0.02676	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author, James Kirchick, is critical of affirmative action, highlighting the hypocrisy of those who support the policy but then use it to undermine the achievements of beneficiaries like Clarence Thomas. Kirchick sees affirmative action as contributing to the devaluation of black professionals' achievements and promoting the notion that they are in their positions due to their race rather than their merits. His argument suggests that affirmative action creates a stigma and does not respect individual accomplishments, which aligns with a stance that is somewhat against or strongly against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the criticism that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced since his confirmation hearings, particularly the accusation that he is an ""affirmative action hire."" Critics, including liberal columnists, have suggested that Thomas was chosen for his position because he is black, rather than on merit. The author argues that such criticism reveals a hypocrisy among advocates of affirmative action, who simultaneously defend the policy while disparaging its beneficiaries as undeserving. The article also touches on Thomas's personal views on affirmative action, as revealed in his memoir ""My Grandfather's Son,"" and the impact of racial preferences on the perception of black professionals. The author, James Kirchick, criticizes the treatment of Thomas by his opponents and calls for him to be treated as an individual rather than a symbol of political disagreements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
James Kirchick's perspective on affirmative action is critical. He points out the inconsistency in supporting affirmative action while criticizing individuals like Clarence Thomas as unqualified beneficiaries of the policy. Kirchick suggests that affirmative action can lead to the devaluation of achievements by black professionals by creating a perception that they are ""affirmative action hires."" He also empathizes with the personal insecurities and shame that Thomas feels because of racial preferences, drawing a parallel with his own identity as a gay man. Kirchick argues that affirmative action, by considering skin color, undermines individual merit and accomplishments. He calls for critics of Thomas to treat him as a human being with individual qualities rather than as a representation of their political grievances."	0.02829	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	Kimberly West-Faulcon's commentary indicates a critical view of the Republicans' use of the hearings to oppose affirmative action. Her perspective suggests that she believes the hearings should have focused on evaluating Sotomayor's qualifications rather than serving as a platform for the Republicans to express their ideology against affirmative action. West-Faulcon's criticism of the Republicans' strategy to highlight their stance against affirmative action through the Ricci case implies that she may see value in affirmative action or at least disapproves of the way it was being politicized during the hearings.	"Summary:
During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination, Republicans focused on national security, the deficit, the right to bear arms, and warned against judicial activism. Legal analysts viewed Sotomayor as maintaining a moderate profile and an open mind. Erwin Chemerinsky felt the hearings allowed senators to address their base and the public to hear Sotomayor but didn't reveal how she would act as a justice. He noted her conservative-leaning statements. Ilya Shapiro criticized Sotomayor for being evasive and less forthcoming than in past speeches. Kimberly West-Faulcon observed that the hearings were more about the Republicans' ideology and affirmative action than about vetting Sotomayor, who presented herself as a moderate and restrained judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Kimberly West-Faulcon's perspective suggests that the Republican senators used the hearings as a platform to challenge affirmative action, a policy designed to address historical injustices and promote diversity by favoring groups who have been discriminated against. West-Faulcon indicates that the Republicans were appealing to the fears of white Americans regarding the rise of nonwhites to positions of power. She interprets their focus on the Ricci case, where white firefighters claimed discrimination, as a strategic move to emphasize their stance against affirmative action. West-Faulcon seems critical of this approach, implying that it overshadowed the true purpose of the hearings, which was to assess Sotomayor's qualifications. She perceives the Republicans' line of questioning as less about evaluating Sotomayor and more about promoting their own legal philosophies and opposing affirmative action."	0.02659	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action. This stance is inferred from the criticism that affirmative action may exacerbate racial tensions and does not benefit the most disadvantaged within the black community. The author suggests that affirmative action helps only a small portion of the community and may inadvertently widen the class gap. Instead of affirmative action, the author advocates for more inclusive programs that address broader economic issues, indicating a preference for solutions that target systemic problems rather than race-based criteria.	"Summary:
The text discusses the causes of the Miami riot and rejects the idea that racial discrimination is the sole reason for such racial violence. It acknowledges that discrimination, particularly from the Miami police force, was a factor but emphasizes that the underlying issue is class conflict. The author points out that the riot was characterized by indiscriminate destruction of property, unlike earlier race riots that involved direct conflict between whites and blacks. The author cites studies from the 1960s that suggest rioters are driven by feelings of ""relative deprivation,"" where violence erupts when they perceive others around them, often within their own race, improving their conditions while they remain stagnant.

The text also highlights the growing class gap within the black community, with an increasing black middle class but persistent poverty among the lower class. The author notes that while the Civil Rights Act of 1964 reduced discrimination in the labor market, it did not help the disadvantaged blacks who lack opportunities for higher education and better jobs. The text criticizes affirmative action for potentially exacerbating racial tensions and widening the class divide within the black community, as it helps only a small portion of the community. Instead, the author advocates for programs aimed at ensuring full employment and reforming the welfare system. However, the text laments that such programs are being cut from the Federal budget, warning that without them, the situation for poor blacks will not improve, and cities will continue to be at risk of racial unrest.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, viewing it as a response that, while well-intentioned, may have unintended negative consequences. The author believes that affirmative action can create a backlash among ethnic groups and working-class whites, as it uses race-conscious criteria. Furthermore, the author argues that affirmative action primarily benefits a small portion of the black community who can access higher education and compete for high-level jobs, leaving the most disadvantaged segments untouched. The author suggests that affirmative action may inadvertently widen the class gap within the black community rather than addressing the broader issues of employment and economic opportunity for all. Instead, the author calls for more inclusive programs that directly target the needs of the poor blacks, such as full employment initiatives, increased teen employment opportunities, and welfare system reform."	0.03258	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's criticism of Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action, combined with the concern that Zumbrun's appointment could undermine the objectives of the Legal Services Corporation, suggests that the author views affirmative action as a positive and necessary policy. The author's disapproval of appointees who are seen as antagonistic to affirmative action further underscores their support for these measures. Although the text does not provide a detailed analysis of affirmative action itself, the author's perspective can be inferred from the critical view of individuals who oppose affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for its choices in appointing Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation and William Bell to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author suggests that these appointments are akin to letting foxes guard henhouses, as Zumbrun has opposed the very law he is set to administer and has a history of supporting corporate interests over public welfare. Bell, on the other hand, is seen as ineffective and lacking experience in civil rights or management, with his only asset being his political work for Reagan. The author views these nominations as an insult to the poor, legal professionals, workers, and the civil rights community, and hints at internal sabotage within the Administration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a negative view of Zumbrun's stance on affirmative action, noting that Zumbrun prefers to assist corporations that oppose government regulation and affirmative action. This suggests that the author believes Zumbrun's leadership would be detrimental to the advancement of affirmative action policies, and by extension, that the author supports the objectives of affirmative action as a means to promote equal opportunity. The mention of affirmative action in the context of criticizing Zumbrun's opposition to it indicates the author's disapproval of those who work against such policies."	0.02008	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided, as the text focuses on the financial aspects of the Westway project and does not provide any commentary or opinion on affirmative action policies or practices.	"Summary:
The text is a critical examination of the financial expenditures on the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. The project's costs have escalated from an initial estimate of $1.4 billion to over $4 billion. The author has received an accounting from the State Transportation Department showing that $75 million has been spent so far, with 90% of funding coming from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10% from the state. The author lists various consultants, engineers, and contractors who have received significant payments, with amounts ranging from around half a million to over $24 million. The author also expresses opposition to the Westway project, calling it a luxury and a boondoggle inappropriate for the current era of budget constraints, and suggests that the funds could be better spent on mass transit rehabilitation. Additionally, the author points out that two recipients, System Design Concepts and Beveridge & Diamond, were admonished by a Federal judge for providing ""false responses"" in a Westway proceeding, raising questions about the legitimacy of their profits from the project.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text provided. The text focuses on the financial aspects of the Westway project and does not delve into the author's views on affirmative action policies or practices. The only mention of affirmative action is in the context of a joint venture listed as ""R.T.P. Inc./Boone, Young & Associates Inc.,"" which received $976,172 as affirmative action consultants for the project. However, this information is presented without commentary on the concept or implementation of affirmative action itself.

3	somewhat_in_favor	The author is critical of a neutral or technical stance on affirmative action, as exemplified by Morris Abram's opposition to quotas and preference. The author believes that affirmative action requires more than neutrality and should actively address historical injustices, as suggested by Justice Blackmun's opinion and Lyndon Johnson's legacy. The author supports affirmative action with accountability and is against a 'bloodless' approach that does not actively redress past wrongs.	"Summary:
The text reflects on a historical moment when President Lyndon Johnson expressed frustration with being unfavorably compared to John F. Kennedy regarding civil rights. It then transitions to discuss Morris Abram's testimony on his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, focusing on the contentious issue of affirmative action. Abram, described as a lifelong opponent of bigotry, holds a technical and neutral stance on affirmative action, opposing the idea of quotas and government preference for any group. The author contrasts this view with the realities of historical injustices and the need for remedial action, citing Justice Blackmun's opinion in the Bakke case that sometimes different treatment is necessary to achieve equality. The author argues for accountability in affirmative action efforts rather than guaranteed outcomes and contends that Lyndon Johnson's own words at Howard University in 1965 offer a more compassionate and proactive approach to equality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text is critical of Morris Abram's perspective on affirmative action. They describe Abram's stance as ""technical, bloodless, [and] uncharacteristically ungenerous,"" suggesting that it lacks empathy and fails to address the deep-rooted inequalities caused by centuries of racism. The author disagrees with Abram's strict neutrality and opposition to quotas, highlighting the need for active measures to redress past wrongs and promote equal opportunity.

The author advocates for a more nuanced approach, acknowledging that while attaching numbers to affirmative action should not guarantee numerical outcomes, it is a necessary tool for ensuring institutions are genuinely striving for diversity and inclusion. They suggest that Abram's view is out of step with the spirit of Lyndon Johnson's civil rights legacy, as Johnson himself articulated the necessity of going beyond just freedom and opportunity to address the systemic barriers that have historically disadvantaged certain groups.

In essence, the author supports affirmative action as a means of creating a more equitable society and believes that it requires more than just neutrality or passive support for social assistance—it requires active and accountable efforts to level the playing field."	0.03017	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	0
	None	The author does not address affirmative action in the sense of policies related to addressing social or racial injustices or promoting diversity in education or employment. The term 'affirmative' is used in a completely different context, pertaining to international relations and diplomacy between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action as it is traditionally understood.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political climate of 1984, with both the United States and the Soviet Union focused on internal power dynamics. The death of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov is seen as reducing the likelihood of resolving tensions between the superpowers, especially in an election year for President Ronald Reagan, whom the Soviets view as hostile. The author suggests that both nations should avoid provocative actions and instead signal a desire for diplomacy. He highlights the potential impact of the Soviet Union easing repression on dissidents, mentioning the cases of Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Shcharansky. The author also criticizes President Reagan's aggressive rhetoric towards the Soviet Union, citing former U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon's opinion that such language hinders the possibility of meaningful negotiations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of policies aimed at addressing historical injustices or promoting diversity. Instead, the term ""affirmative"" is used in a different context, referring to the possibility of positive or ""affirmative"" signals or actions that the United States and the Soviet Union could take to demonstrate a willingness to engage in diplomacy. The author suggests that such gestures, while not changing international policy, could foster a climate of respect and potentially lead to discussions on more substantial issues like arms control in the future. The specific affirmative action mentioned is the potential for the Soviet Union to make a human gesture by easing up on the repression of dissidents, which could positively affect Western opinion and open up avenues for negotiation."	0.027120000000000002	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective is characterized by a supportive tone towards affirmative action, especially in the context of addressing identified discrimination within the FBI. The text outlines concrete steps taken by the agency's director to improve equal treatment for minority employees, such as appointing an external manager and diversifying promotion boards. The author's mention of the FBI's responsibility to enforce civil rights laws and the necessity for the agency to adhere to these laws internally further indicates a favorable view of affirmative action as a tool for ensuring equality and rectifying past discrimination.	"Summary:
The text discusses actions taken by William Sessions, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in response to findings of discrimination within the agency. Sessions acknowledged the failure of the FBI's existing affirmative action efforts and announced changes, including the appointment of an external manager to oversee equal treatment of minority employees and the inclusion of black and Hispanic agents on internal promotion boards. This follows a federal judge's ruling that the FBI was guilty of gross discrimination against Hispanic agents and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's support for discrimination complaints by Donald Rochon, a black agent. The urgency for effective remedies is highlighted by instances of FBI recruiters being turned away from campuses due to the agency's history of discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive, especially within the context of an agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws. The author indicates that affirmative action is necessary to address and rectify the discrimination that has been identified within the FBI. The author views the steps taken by Director Sessions as a promise for improvement and underscores the importance of the FBI not only enforcing civil rights laws externally but also adhering to them internally. The tone suggests that the author believes in the need for prompt and effective affirmative action measures to ensure equal treatment and opportunities for minority group employees within the FBI."	0.01857	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt	0
	None	The text summary provided does not address the topic of affirmative action in the context of addressing discrimination or promoting diversity. Instead, it refers to the political maneuvering and strategies of the Bush Administration regarding executive and legislative powers. The mention of 'affirmative legislative action' relates to budget appropriations and the concept of 'enhanced rescission,' which is a separate issue from the typical discourse on affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the perceived slow and cautious approach of the Bush Administration, as illustrated by a joke about President Bush being knocked unconscious for three and a half years and waking up to an unchanged world. The author visits White House chief of staff John Sununu to discuss this perception and the administration's strategies. Sununu introduces the concept of a ""different template"" for governance under Bush, contrasting with the Reagan era. The author also touches on political issues such as the contra policy and the concept of ""enhanced rescission,"" which is an alternative to the line-item veto and a way to regain executive power lost in 1974. The author remains skeptical about the administration's ability to enact this change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action or the author's perspective on it. Instead, the term ""affirmative legislative action"" is mentioned in the context of the ""enhanced rescission"" concept, which relates to the executive's power to manage budget appropriations. Affirmative legislative action, in this context, refers to the current requirement for Congress to actively agree to rescind parts of appropriations. The author appears to be interested in the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, rather than discussing the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy for addressing discrimination or diversity in employment, education, or other areas."	0.02659	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Julian Bond, uses satire to criticize the media's portrayal of civil rights initiatives, including affirmative action. His use of irony to mock the media's approach to covering the NAACP and civil rights efforts indicates that he is in favor of affirmative action. Bond's text implies that affirmative action is a necessary measure to combat racial inequities and should be supported rather than stigmatized. His satirical tone is used to underscore the legitimacy and importance of affirmative action, suggesting that media criticisms are unfounded and recycle outdated arguments against civil rights progress.	"Summary:
The text is a satirical memo written by Julian Bond, a former member of the NAACP board of directors, addressing journalists and pundits. It sarcastically suggests how the media can portray the NAACP and civil rights leadership as outdated and disconnected from the concerns of black Americans. The memo mocks the media's tendency to focus on divisive issues and to seek out voices that criticize the NAACP and civil rights efforts. It also ironically advises journalists to ignore the broad support for the NAACP among black Americans and to instead highlight the views of a select few who may oppose certain civil rights initiatives. The memo ends with a tongue-in-cheek offer of assistance for those needing further guidance on how to spin their stories.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
From the text, it is apparent that the author, Julian Bond, views affirmative action as a necessary and positive measure to address historical and ongoing discrimination. He criticizes the media's portrayal of affirmative action as potentially harmful or as making its beneficiaries feel bad. Bond's perspective is that such criticisms are unfounded and recycle old arguments used against civil rights advancements in the past. He implies that affirmative action is a legitimate form of redress for racial inequities and that it should not be stigmatized or misrepresented. Bond's satirical approach suggests that he believes the media often unfairly targets affirmative action and civil rights initiatives, undermining their importance and efficacy."	0.02411	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt	0
	None	The author does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action but rather uses Bob Dole's shifting position on the issue as an example of Dole's broader pattern of indecisiveness and lack of leadership. The author's focus is on criticizing Dole's political maneuvering and inconsistency, not on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central concern of the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses Bob Dole's indecisive approach to his presidential campaign against Bill Clinton, particularly concerning his strategy in tackling Clinton's character and ethical issues. Dole's hesitation to confront Clinton aggressively has been perceived as a lack of leadership, damaging his image as a candidate. The author mentions several instances where Dole has wavered on key issues, including his stance on affirmative action and supply-side economics, which he reversed to align more with Ronald Reagan's policies. This pattern of equivocation and retreat under pressure has led to doubts about his ability to lead effectively, contrasting with his physical courage displayed 50 years prior. The text suggests that while Dole's public display of ambivalence might be seen as honesty, it undermines his image as a strong leader capable of winning the presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that Bob Dole abruptly reversed his long-standing support for affirmative action, among other positions, to cater to the political climate and present himself in a certain light (""another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want""). This suggests that the author views Dole's shift on affirmative action as a political maneuver rather than a principled stand, highlighting it as an example of Dole's broader pattern of inconsistency and lack of steadfastness on policy issues. The perspective presented is critical of Dole's change in stance, implying that it is part of his character failings and contributes to his lack of credibility as a presidential candidate."	0.02579	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be critical of the idea of abolishing affirmative action without having a proper alternative in place that addresses the underlying issues of race and poverty. The criticism of the Republican Party for focusing on the end of affirmative action instead of the root causes, and the mention of key GOP figures who support a fair reform of affirmative action, suggest that the author is in favor of maintaining or reforming affirmative action rather than eliminating it. The author's call for substantive changes over symbolic gestures and the emphasis on real solutions indicate a stance that is supportive of affirmative action as a means to address systemic problems, albeit with the recognition that reform may be necessary.	"Summary:
The text criticizes Congress for considering a bill to apologize for slavery, which some see as an empty gesture. Figures like Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich oppose the idea. The author suggests that Congress should focus on substantive changes rather than symbolic acts. The Republican Party is criticized for focusing on ending affirmative action rather than addressing the root causes of issues like failing schools. The GOP lacks an alternative that would satisfy key figures within the party who support a fair reform of affirmative action. President Clinton's approach to racial policy is seen as mostly symbolic, involving a national conversation and a commission, but lacking concrete action. The author acknowledges Clinton's empathy towards African-Americans but argues that empathy alone does not solve problems like unemployment, housing, or education. The text suggests that the President should work with mayors to address the crises of race and poverty in cities. The author is concerned that if the current political approach continues, it will result in the repeal of affirmative action and a report with no real progress, leaving much to be apologized for.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it should not be abolished without a safety net for the poor. The author criticizes the Republican Party's efforts to end affirmative action, suggesting that it is a popular move in polls but does not address the underlying issues, particularly in education. The text implies that a just reform of affirmative action is necessary and that some key figures in the GOP, such as Colin Powell, Jack Kemp, and J.C. Watts, support this idea. The author seems to advocate for a thoughtful approach to reforming affirmative action rather than its outright elimination, emphasizing the need for real solutions to the problems of race and poverty."	0.02858	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author describes Albert Carnesale as someone who believes in the importance of diversity and sees affirmative action as one tool to achieve it, although he acknowledges the need for alternative strategies due to changes in policy. Carnesale's advocacy for diversity and his active search for other methods to maintain it, despite the prohibition of considering race, ethnicity, or gender in admissions, indicate that while he may not be able to support affirmative action in its traditional form, he still values its objectives and seeks to achieve them through other means.	"Summary:
Albert Carnesale, the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), arrived at a critical juncture for affirmative action in California. The Regents of the University of California had implemented a new policy prohibiting racial or ethnic preferences in graduate school admissions, and Proposition 209 extended this rule to all state institutions. This led to a significant decrease in the number of Hispanic and black students at UCLA's Law School. Carnesale believes diversity is crucial for UCLA to fulfill its educational responsibilities and outlines three reasons: enhanced education through diverse perspectives, preparing leaders for all societal segments, and promoting social and economic mobility through education. He suggests strategies for maintaining diversity, such as encouraging minority students to apply and enroll, engaging more with high schools, and aspiring for equal educational opportunities for all children. Carnesale also points out that university admissions consider various factors beyond academic scores, such as personal achievements and talents, but not race, ethnicity, or gender.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Albert Carnesale's perspective on affirmative action as a means to an end, with the end being the pursuit of diversity in education. Carnesale views diversity as essential for providing a high-quality education, preparing societal leaders, and enabling social and economic mobility. He sees affirmative action not as an end in itself but as one of the tools that can be used to achieve the broader goal of a diverse and equitable educational environment. Despite the challenges posed by the new policies in California, Carnesale advocates for alternative methods to promote diversity, including outreach to potential minority students and a more significant presence in high schools. He emphasizes that while race, ethnicity, and gender may no longer be considered in admissions, universities still actively seek a varied student body with diverse experiences and talents. The author's portrayal of Carnesale's views suggests a nuanced understanding of affirmative action, recognizing its role in fostering diversity while also acknowledging the need to find new ways to achieve this goal in the face of changing policies."	0.02978	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's text does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action but does acknowledge its significance and controversy in discussions about race. The author notes the guarded nature of the conversation and suggests that a more focused and organized discussion on affirmative action could have been beneficial. The mention of General Colin Powell's success, which President Clinton attributes to affirmative action, without any explicit agreement or disagreement from the author, implies an understanding of the policy's potential benefits. However, the lack of a definitive position or argument for or against affirmative action in the text leads to the conclusion that the author is neutral, simply reporting on the event and indicating that the topic warrants further discussion.	"Summary:
The text discusses President Clinton's national town meeting on race, which took place in Akron, Ohio. The event aimed to stimulate a broad, national conversation on race by bringing together college students, civic leaders, and business people to discuss issues of racial identity, affirmative action, and education. The author notes that the discussion was generally guarded and lacked focus and spark until President Clinton directly addressed the topic of affirmative action with panelist Abigail Thernstrom. Clinton questioned Thernstrom about her views on affirmative action, using the example of General Colin Powell's success in the Army as a result of such policies. Thernstrom differentiated between affirmative action and racial preferences, but the discussion did not delve deeply into the topic. The author suggests that future town meetings could be more effective if they were better organized, with focused discussions on specific issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a significant and controversial topic within the broader discussion of race in America. They highlight President Clinton's direct approach to the subject during the town meeting, particularly his pointed question to Thernstrom about the role of affirmative action in General Powell's career. The author implies that this exchange was a critical moment that could have energized the conversation and that there is value in exploring the distinction between affirmative action and racial preferences more thoroughly. The author seems to suggest that affirmative action, as implemented by the Army, has been successful and that this success is worth discussing in detail. Overall, the author's perspective seems to recognize the complexity of affirmative action and the need for more in-depth, focused debate on the issue."	0.023079999999999996	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Lani Guinier, is portrayed as viewing affirmative action positively, emphasizing its role in promoting diversity and social justice. While acknowledging the policy's challenges, Guinier appreciates innovative approaches like Texas's '10 percent plan' that foster diversity without overtly using race as a factor. She commends efforts to improve educational quality and equity, suggesting that affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully, can benefit a wide range of students. The author's approval of affirmative action is evident in her support for policies that aim to increase diversity and her positive assessment of the Texas plan's outcomes.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action policies on university admissions, focusing on the contrasting outcomes in California and Texas. After California banned affirmative action, resulting in a significant drop in admissions for blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians at top universities, there was concern about the resegregation of higher education. Texas, however, responded differently to a similar federal court ruling that outlawed consideration of race in admissions. Texas implemented the ""10 percent plan,"" which guaranteed admission to the top public universities for students in the top 10 percent of their high school class, regardless of their SAT scores. This approach led to an increase in eligible black and Mexican-American applicants and improved access for white students from rural areas. Texas also introduced measures to improve primary education by requiring schools to report performance data by race, ethnicity, and economic standing. As a result, Texas students, including minority and economically disadvantaged groups, showed significant improvements in national test scores, in contrast to California's students, who performed poorly.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Lani Guinier, appears to support affirmative action as a tool for promoting diversity and social justice in higher education. However, Guinier also acknowledges the challenges and controversies surrounding the policy, as seen in California's experience. She presents Texas's 10 percent plan as a positive alternative that has successfully increased diversity without explicitly using race as a criterion. Guinier seems to advocate for innovative approaches that ensure equal opportunity and educational excellence for all students, suggesting that diversity and access need not be at odds with high standards. She praises Texas's efforts to address educational disparities and create a less polarized discussion around affirmative action, implying that such inclusive strategies can lead to better outcomes for students across all demographics."	0.027440000000000003	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	Henry Louis Gates Jr. is portrayed as viewing affirmative action as a positive force that has contributed to the growth of the black middle class and has been instrumental in creating opportunities for African Americans. He attributes the progress made since the late 1960s to the start of affirmative action programs. While he acknowledges that there are structural challenges that continue to affect the African American community, he also believes in the community's agency to address these issues, suggesting a proactive stance in utilizing tools like affirmative action to improve their situation. Thus, Gates seems to be in favor of affirmative action, as he recognizes its benefits and advocates for continued engagement with such programs.	"Summary:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical relationship between literacy, freedom, and African American identity, starting with the Stono Rebellion of 1739 and the subsequent ban on slave literacy. He emphasizes the importance of literacy as a means of liberation and the role of slave narratives in asserting humanity and challenging oppression. Gates highlights the current issue of the digital divide, where African Americans are less likely to have access to the internet and personal computers compared to their white counterparts, a gap not fully explained by income differences. He warns that this digital divide risks creating a new form of disenfranchisement, especially for children needing educational resources and cultural context. Gates also notes the social disconnection caused by slavery and segregation and how new forms of isolation affect the black middle class and underclass today. He calls for relevant internet content to engage African Americans, similar to how ""race records"" in the 1920s drew black audiences to the recording industry. Gates suggests that African Americans can address this ""cybersegregation"" by utilizing community resources to bridge the digital divide and reconnect with their cultural and historical legacy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. views affirmative action positively, as he attributes the growth of the black middle class since the late 1960s to the start of affirmative action programs. He sees these programs as instrumental in creating opportunities and fostering upward mobility within the African American community. Gates also implies that while structural factors contribute to ongoing inequality, the African American community has the agency to address behavioral aspects of these challenges, such as embracing new technologies and creating relevant content. Affirmative action is seen as a tool that has helped to mitigate some of the negative effects of historical segregation and disenfranchisement, but Gates also stresses the need for proactive community engagement to overcome new forms of segregation in the digital age."	0.03238	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but the context suggests a negative view of Richard Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance. By describing Barrett's protest as 'anemic,' the author implies that the effort to oppose affirmative action is weak or lacking in support. Additionally, the author's focus on the community's celebration of diversity and unity in the face of Barrett's rally indirectly supports the principles of affirmative action without explicitly endorsing the policy. The narrative shows a community that values inclusion and stands against Barrett's racist ideology, which further implies that the author may view affirmative action as a positive force for promoting racial harmony and equality.	"Summary:
Morristown, a town with historical significance from the Revolutionary War, faced a challenge to its values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness when Richard Barrett, a white supremacist from Mississippi, held a rally there. Barrett, leader of the Nationalist Movement, chose Morristown to voice his opposition to the privileges of minorities, likening his stance to George Washington's rejection of monarchical privileges. His presence prompted a counter-protest that led to clashes with police, arrests, and the use of pepper spray.

In response to Barrett's divisive agenda, Morristown's community gathered at the Calvary Baptist Church for a celebration of diversity, which was arranged by the mayor to avoid direct confrontation with Barrett. The event drew a large crowd and featured prayers and songs promoting unity across different races and religions. The town's commitment to racial harmony was emphasized, despite the presence of lingering racial tensions, as evidenced by a local sign commemorating a victim of alleged racial profiling by police.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. However, the author describes Barrett's rally as an ""anemic anti-affirmative action protest,"" suggesting a lack of vigor or effectiveness in Barrett's opposition to affirmative action. The author also highlights the community's strong rejection of Barrett's racist ideology and its celebration of diversity, indirectly implying support for the principles of equality and inclusion that underpin affirmative action policies. The narrative suggests that while Morristown has its challenges with racial harmony, the community largely stands together against the ideologies that Barrett represents."	0.02828	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the positive depiction of Dr. Formicola's efforts to increase minority enrollment and the establishment of community health centers and dental clinics in underserved areas. The author highlights the success of these initiatives and questions the sustainability of these efforts post-retirement, indicating a belief in the value and necessity of such programs. The overall tone and content suggest that the author supports affirmative action policies and views them as effective tools for addressing inequality and improving access to quality care for underprivileged communities.	"Summary:
The text discusses the positive impact of Dr. Allan J. Formicola, who is retiring after 23 years as the dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery. Contrary to the typical image of private universities like Columbia being at odds with underprivileged communities, Dr. Formicola has used his position to attract minority students to the dental school and to extend high-quality dental care to neighborhoods such as Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Known for his warm manner and ability to connect with different people, he has been instrumental in increasing minority enrollment at the dental school and establishing community health centers and dental clinics in local schools. His efforts have also led to the creation of a mobile dental care unit for children and the elderly. The text touches on the broader issue of affirmative action and inequality, highlighting Dr. Formicola's belief in the responsibility of those in power to serve the surrounding community in need. The dental school under his leadership has become a national model for community partnerships and clinics. The article concludes by questioning whether the initiatives and successes achieved during Dr. Formicola's tenure will be sustained after his retirement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, exemplified through the portrayal of Dr. Formicola's work in increasing minority enrollment and involvement at Columbia's dental school. The author suggests that Dr. Formicola's actions serve as an answer to the broader debate about affirmative action and the responsibilities of those in positions of power to address inequality. The text implies support for initiatives that draw minorities into professions and provide services to underserved communities, highlighting the positive outcomes of such policies, such as improved dental care in minority neighborhoods and the potential for reducing health disparities. The author seems to advocate for the continuation of these efforts, emphasizing the importance of institutional commitment to maintaining the legacy created by leaders like Dr. Formicola."	0.02982	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical commentary on the Republican Party's approach to racial issues and affirmative action suggests a stance that is skeptical of the party's commitment to these principles. The author's use of terms like 'hypocrisy,' 'cynical manipulation,' and 'superficial' outreach indicates a belief that the Republican Party's engagement with affirmative action is not genuine and is instead driven by political motives. The author's perspective is critical of the party's sincerity and effectiveness in promoting racial equality, which reflects a stance that is somewhat against the way affirmative action is being handled by the party in question.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on the political fallout following controversial remarks made by Senator Trent Lott at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party. The author delves into the broader issue of racial politics in the Republican Party, suggesting that Lott's faux pas and subsequent overtures to racial minorities are part of a larger pattern of hypocrisy and cynical manipulation of race by some Republican politicians. The text references other incidents and figures, including John Ashcroft and George W. Bush, to argue that Lott is not an outlier but rather a symptom of a more pervasive problem. The author also criticizes the media and political establishment for their delayed response to Lott's history with racist organizations and suggests that the Republican Party's outreach to black voters is often superficial and politically motivated.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be skeptical of the Republican Party's commitment to affirmative action and racial equality, citing Trent Lott's sudden and seemingly insincere endorsement of ""across the board"" affirmative action as an example of the party's opportunistic approach to race-related issues. The text implies that the party's public support for diversity and affirmative action is often a public relations strategy rather than a genuine commitment to civil rights, as evidenced by the reference to President Bush's ""affirmative access"" policy and the lack of black Republican Congressmen. The author suggests that the Republican Party's real interest lies in appealing to moderate suburban voters rather than addressing the substantive needs and rights of black Americans. Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action within the context of the Republican Party is critical and questioning of the party's true intentions and effectiveness in promoting racial equality."	0.03848	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	James O. Freedman is characterized as 'strongly in favor' of affirmative action based on the summary provided. His defense of the value of a liberal education includes a clear advocacy for the importance of educating minority men and women, which is a fundamental goal of affirmative action. Additionally, his involvement in supporting the University of Michigan's affirmative action program through the American Jewish Committee's board of governors and his preparation of a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court further demonstrate his strong support for affirmative action policies. Freedman's actions and commitment to promoting diversity, tolerance, and civility in academia align with the objectives of affirmative action, indicating his deep belief in its necessity for a healthy democracy and society.	"Summary:
James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth and author of ""Liberal Education and the Public Interest,"" passionately defends the value of a liberal education against critics who see it as an impractical luxury. He argues that a liberal education equips individuals with critical thinking, writing skills, and a moral compass, making them more valuable in the job market over a long career. Despite undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Freedman remains focused on advocating for the liberal values he has championed throughout his life. He has also been involved in supporting affirmative action, emphasizing the importance of educating minority men and women for America's future. Freedman has a history of promoting diversity, tolerance, and civility in academia, as seen during his tenure at Dartmouth, where he addressed challenges such as the actions of a right-wing student group. In retirement, he continues to be a respected voice in academic circles, offering guidance and wisdom drawn from his extensive experience and personal challenges.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
James O. Freedman is a strong proponent of affirmative action. He views it as essential for the future of America, stressing the importance of educating minority men and women. His commitment to this cause is evident in his involvement with the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, where he helped prepare a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. Freedman sees affirmative action as a means to create a more inclusive and diverse educational environment, which he believes is crucial for a healthy democracy and society. His actions and words reflect a deep belief in the value of equal educational opportunities for all, regardless of background, and the role of affirmative action in achieving this goal."	0.03426	affirmative action	txt/432317583.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be somewhat in favor. The text highlights Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's potential sympathy towards affirmative action based on her own experiences with gender discrimination and her appointment to the Supreme Court, which could be viewed as a form of affirmative action. The author suggests that O'Connor's personal history and her judicial approach, which considers real-world impacts, might lead her to support the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies. The author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action but presents it in a positive light by discussing O'Connor's potential support and the benefits of such policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's consideration of two cases against the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies in admissions. Kirk Kolbo, representing the plaintiffs who argue that affirmative action is unconstitutional, was questioned by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor about the role of race in the university's decision-making process. O'Connor, known for being the swing vote on the Rehnquist court, has often sided with the conservative majority but has also shown a tendency to uphold major precedents and consider the real-world impact of the Court's decisions. Despite her conservative and sometimes callous rulings, O'Connor has shown sympathy in certain cases involving women and children. The text suggests that O'Connor's own experience of benefiting from a form of affirmative action when President Reagan appointed her to the Supreme Court might influence her perspective on the University of Michigan cases.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as potentially sympathetic to affirmative action, despite her conservative background. The author notes O'Connor's own experience with gender discrimination and her subsequent appointment to the Supreme Court, which could be seen as a form of affirmative action. The author suggests that O'Connor's personal history and her judicial philosophy that avoids sweeping pronouncements might lead her to side with the university and uphold the affirmative action policies. O'Connor's questions during the oral arguments indicate her concern about the real-world consequences of a colorblind admissions policy, particularly the impact on minority representation at elite institutions. The author implies that O'Connor's inclination to see herself in the litigants and her understanding of the benefits of affirmative action in her own life may influence her decision in favor of the University of Michigan's policies."	0.030200000000000005	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action policies, he defends the concept of diversity in the newsroom and suggests that the failure of Jayson Blair should not be attributed to affirmative action or diversity efforts. The author's argument that diversity is beneficial and not the root of the problem, as well as his rejection of the critics' simplistic view that links Blair's rise to affirmative action, indicates a perspective that is at least somewhat supportive of the principles behind affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an email from a New York Times columnist commenting on the Jayson Blair scandal, where Blair, a reporter for the Times, committed repeated acts of journalism fraud through plagiarism and fabrication. The scandal is described as a low point in the newspaper's history, with the executive editor, Howell Raines, committed to transparency and reform to prevent future incidents. The columnist discusses reactions in Washington, noting the schadenfreude among conservatives who critique the Times for what they perceive as liberal bias and for the supposed failure of affirmative action, which they believe led to Blair's undeserved promotions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges the affirmative action angle that critics use to taunt the Times, suggesting that Blair was treated with undue leniency and promoted when he should have been fired because of his minority status. The author seems to reject this simplistic view, arguing that diversity is not the root of the problem. He defends the idea that newspapers can choose to support minority journalists and suggests that the media world would benefit from more diversity. The author believes that the truth should be reported accurately, and while he does not explicitly endorse affirmative action, he suggests that diversity itself is not to blame for the scandal and that a balance of perspectives, including conservative ones, is maintained at the Times. He urges his colleagues to learn from the incident rather than dwelling on it excessively."	0.02544	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author presents a nuanced perspective that recognizes the arguments on both sides of the affirmative action debate. They acknowledge the Supreme Court's current support for affirmative action while also noting that it is considered a temporary measure, not a solution to the root causes of educational disparities. By discussing the various factors contributing to the achievement gap and the need for broader educational reform, the author maintains a balanced view without showing a strong bias either for or against affirmative action. The mention of opponents and supporters suggests a recognition of the complexity of the issue rather than a personal endorsement or rejection of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The article discusses the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in university admissions, with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor predicting a 25-year time frame for its necessity. The decision raises questions about the future of affirmative action and the measures needed to close educational disparities between racial and ethnic groups. Statistics show persistent academic achievement gaps, and experts and advocates debate the influence of school financing, social inequality, and study habits. Some argue for equalizing educational spending, while others point to the need for broader socioeconomic changes. Affirmative action benefits mostly middle-income students and is seen as a temporary bridge rather than a solution to underlying issues. The article also touches on the history of affirmative action and its legal challenges, with opponents calling for an end to such programs and supporters arguing for systemic educational reform.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a balanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging both the arguments for and against it. The perspective suggests that while affirmative action is currently upheld by the Supreme Court, it is not a permanent solution to the disparities in educational achievement. Justice O'Connor's comments imply that affirmative action is a temporary measure, meant to bridge the gap until greater equality in education can be achieved. The author highlights the complexity of the issue, with factors such as school financing, social inequality, and family habits contributing to the persistent achievement gap. The article also underscores the demographic changes that will increase the pressure to address educational disparities, with a growing proportion of minority students entering college. Ultimately, the author conveys that all parties agree on the need to close the education gap, but there is significant debate on how to achieve this and the role of affirmative action in that process."	0.03952	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author views the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the use of race in admissions at the University of Michigan as a positive outcome, aligning with what they perceive to be mainstream American values. The author's relief at the Court's moderation and avoidance of a landmark ruling against affirmative action implies a favorable view of the policy. The author's perspective suggests that they support affirmative action as a practice that contributes to fairness and diversity in education, and they seem to advocate for the maintenance of this policy through public vigilance and moderate court appointments.	"Summary:
The article discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's actions, which have demonstrated a level of moderation that has surprised many, given the conservative hopes tied to the Republican-appointed majority. The Court upheld the use of race in admissions at the University of Michigan, avoiding a landmark ruling against affirmative action, and ruled that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected, overturning a previous decision. The Court also halted its states' rights crusade, upholding federal law protections for state workers under the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, the Court's mainstream approach led to some decisions that did not protect the marginalized, such as upholding California's ""three strikes"" law. The term highlighted the far-right stance of the Court's most conservative justices, while the left did not attempt to push beyond mainstream American thought. The article concludes with a warning that the appointment of an extreme conservative justice could significantly impact American life, and it calls for public vigilance to maintain the Court's moderate reflections of American values.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action positively, as they describe the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions as an endorsement of a national consensus and a moderation from the Court. They imply that the Court's decision aligns with mainstream American values and that it was a relief to those who feared a more conservative ruling against affirmative action. The author suggests that the Court, by upholding affirmative action, has resisted the push from the right to appoint judges who would oppose such policies. This indicates that the author believes affirmative action to be a beneficial and accepted practice that contributes to the fairness and diversity of educational opportunities."	0.026999999999999996	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt	0
	None	The author's primary focus is on the internal dynamics of political parties and the importance of embracing the more passionate and extreme members of a party for electoral success. The mention of affirmative action is incidental and does not reflect the author's personal stance on the issue. It is used as an example of President Bush's fluctuating positions rather than as a focal point for discussion. Consequently, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
Sam Tanenhaus discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, where liberal presidential candidates are at odds with the party's moderate leaders and strategists. The latter group warns against extremism, fearing a repeat of past defeats in the 1972 and 1984 elections. However, Tanenhaus points out that the Republican Party has found success by embracing their passionate base and selecting candidates that excite them. He argues that far-left ideology may not be the reason for Democratic losses and that voters are not always driven by ideology, as evidenced by the fluctuating public support for different presidential policies over the decades. The author suggests that the energy and passion of ideologues are vital for political parties and references the 1964 election where Barry Goldwater's conservative ""extremism"" eventually led to a revitalization of the conservative movement. He concludes that the Republican Party has learned to value its zealous supporters, while the Democratic Party remains cautious, not realizing that listening to its extremists could be beneficial.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author does not directly focus on affirmative action, he briefly mentions that President Bush has shown support for ""some types of affirmative action."" This passing reference indicates that Bush's position on affirmative action does not adhere strictly to conservative or liberal lines, as he is also described as fluctuating between small-government conservative and big-government liberal stances on other issues. The author's main argument is about the importance of listening to the more passionate and extreme members of a political party, rather than about the specifics of affirmative action policy. Therefore, the author does not provide a clear perspective on affirmative action itself within this text."	0.03179	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Ian Haney Lopez, critiques the current interpretation of anti-discrimination law, particularly regarding affirmative action. He is critical of the Supreme Court's approach to equating all race-conscious government actions with racism, which creates constitutional hurdles for affirmative action. Lopez emphasizes the need to focus on ending racial subordination as opposed to simply avoiding the use of formal racial distinctions. His perspective is rooted in the belief that affirmative action is not equivalent to racism and is necessary to combat systemic oppression and racial subordination. Therefore, the author is 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action, as he supports its intent to address inequality but is critical of how its legal interpretation has evolved to hinder its effectiveness.	"Summary:
The text discusses the significance of Hernandez v. Texas, a Supreme Court case decided on May 3, 1954, which is often overshadowed by the more famous Brown v. Board of Education case. Hernandez v. Texas extended constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans by establishing that the Constitution should bar discrimination against any group that suffers subordination, not just those defined by race. The case involved jury discrimination against Mexican-Americans in Texas, where both the community leaders and the state argued that Mexican-Americans were white. The Supreme Court had to decide under what circumstances groups deserve constitutional protection and concluded that protection should apply to all socially defined groups that are treated as inferior. The author contrasts this with Brown v. Board of Education, which did not explicitly state that school segregation was unconstitutional because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than simply because it was based on race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ian Haney Lopez, presents a critical view of the contemporary interpretation of anti-discrimination law, particularly as it pertains to affirmative action. He argues that the Supreme Court has distorted the anti-caste commitment of Brown v. Board of Education by treating all race-conscious government action as equivalent to racism, erecting significant constitutional barriers against affirmative action. Lopez criticizes Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that laws distributing benefits based on race are morally and constitutionally equivalent to laws designed to subjugate a race. He contends that the current court misunderstands Brown by reasoning as if the use of race itself, rather than racism and maltreatment, is what offends the Constitution. Lopez suggests that Hernandez v. Texas provided a clearer standard that should be at the forefront of 14th Amendment law, focused on ending racial subordination rather than merely prohibiting the state use of formal racial distinctions."	0.03189	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not clearly stated in the text. The text merely includes a factual reference to President Bush's stance on Supreme Court justice nominations, without providing any analysis or opinion from the author. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text provided is a list of questions and answers relating to various political events and figures, primarily focusing on President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry during a period of political campaigns and debates. The topics range from Osama bin Laden, Social Security, political advertisements, celebrity endorsements, the Iraq War, Supreme Court justice preferences, and the invasion of Iraq. The answers are provided at the end of the text, indicating the correct response to each question.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the question about President Bush's unacceptable position for a Supreme Court justice. The options provided include pro-euthanasia, pro-abortion, pro-fluoridation, pro-affirmative action, and pro-slavery, with the correct answer being pro-affirmative action (d). This suggests that President Bush would find a pro-affirmative action stance unacceptable in a Supreme Court justice nominee. The inclusion of this question, alongside other politically charged topics, indicates that the author is highlighting various contentious issues during the Bush-Kerry election period. However, without additional context or commentary, it's difficult to ascertain the author's personal stance on affirmative action based solely on this question."	0.02853	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text provides a balanced overview of the situation at Harvard, discussing the controversy around Lawrence Summers and the broader issues of gender and affirmative action without explicitly stating their personal stance on affirmative action. The author mentions both sides of the affirmative action debate, referencing advocates and opponents, but does not reveal their own perspective. Instead, the author focuses on how affirmative action is perceived in the context of Harvard's politics and leadership. The mention of Derek Bok as a proponent and the suggestion that Summers may be perceived as against it due to his troubles, without personal endorsement or criticism, suggests a neutral presentation of the issue.	"Summary:
The article discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, then-president of Harvard University, who suggested that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude. The controversy, dubbed ""Gendergate,"" sparked protests on campus and ignited a debate about Harvard's identity as either liberal or conservative. The piece highlights various issues at Harvard, such as the low number of tenured women professors, campus expansion, and the university's endowment, which are all viewed through a political lens. The author contrasts Summers with his predecessors, noting his confrontations and conservative approach within the university context. The article also touches on the broader implications of Summers' presidency and the challenges Harvard faces, including the development of a new campus, curriculum overhaul, and endowment usage.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author conveys that affirmative action is a contentious topic at Harvard, with liberals advocating for its use to address the low number of tenured women professors and conservatives arguing against it. Former President Derek Bok is mentioned as a proponent of affirmative action, having written a book on the merits of race-based preferences. In contrast, Lawrence Summers' actions and statements have led some to believe he is not in favor of affirmative action, as suggested by Harvey Mansfield's comments that attribute Summers' troubles to his perceived stance against affirmative action. The author presents affirmative action as a polarizing issue that reflects the broader political divide at Harvard and beyond."	0.03164	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of John McCain's career suggests a negative perspective on the kind of affirmative action that benefits individuals based on family legacy rather than merit. By contrasting McCain's 'affirmative action scion of admirals' background with Obama's merit-based achievements, the author appears to be somewhat against certain applications of affirmative action, particularly those that do not align with meritocratic principles.	"Summary:
The text discusses the apparent envy of various political figures—Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, and John McCain—toward Barack Obama during his political rise. Bill Clinton is described as begrudging Obama's success and playing subtle racial politics. Jesse Jackson is portrayed as having been focused on exploiting white guilt for political gain, a strategy that is becoming outdated with Obama's different approach to civil rights and equality. John McCain is depicted as running a petty and juvenile campaign, resorting to low blows and personal attacks against Obama, which contrasts sharply with his previous image as an honorable politician. McCain's envy is attributed to Obama's popularity and the shift in perception of what constitutes ""cool"" in politics. The author also notes McCain's awareness of his own privileged background as an ""affirmative action scion of admirals"" compared to Obama's merit-based achievements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of John McCain's career. The author implies that McCain's entry into the Naval Academy and subsequent opportunities may have been influenced by his family's military legacy, suggesting that his career benefited from a form of affirmative action. In contrast, the author highlights Obama's merit-based accomplishments, such as writing his own books and not disclosing his race on his Harvard Law School application, to illustrate a self-made success story. The author seems to suggest that McCain's privileged background and the benefits he received because of it are part of the reason for his envy towards Obama, who has risen to prominence on his own merits."	0.02722	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Helene Cooper, provides a balanced and reflective view on affirmative action. She recognizes the benefits and opportunities that affirmative action has afforded to minorities, including herself, and its role in creating a diverse elite within American society. Cooper also acknowledges the internal conflicts and struggles experienced by the recipients of affirmative action, such as feelings of inadequacy and the development of a 'double consciousness.' Despite these challenges, she seems to believe in the necessity of affirmative action as a step towards a more integrated society and appreciates the progress it has enabled, as seen in the rise of influential figures like Barack Obama. Her perspective is not uncritical, as she is aware of the complexities and the potential cynicism behind the policies, but she does not outright oppose them. Instead, she engages with the implications of affirmative action for race relations in America.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the impact of affirmative action policies that began in 1969 when prestigious U.S. universities started actively recruiting black and Latino students. These policies aimed to make campuses more representative of the nation's diversity in response to the civil rights movement. Forty years later, the author notes that a new elite has emerged, with individuals such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett, who have benefited from affirmative action. The author discusses the complex feelings of being part of this cohort, including feelings of inadequacy and the development of a ""double consciousness"" that allows for easier navigation between different cultural worlds. The author, Helene Cooper, shares her own experiences as an affirmative action beneficiary at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and reflects on the broader implications of these policies for American society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Helene Cooper, presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. She acknowledges the opportunities it has created for minorities, including herself, to attend prestigious universities and advance in society. Cooper illustrates how affirmative action has been instrumental in fostering a diverse elite and enabling individuals to occupy influential positions in American leadership. However, she also candidly discusses the internal struggles and feelings of inadequacy that can accompany beneficiaries of such policies, as well as the complexities of racial identity and the ""double consciousness"" that results from navigating different cultural expectations.

Cooper seems to view affirmative action as a necessary phase in the journey towards a more integrated and representative society, as evidenced by the election of Barack Obama, who she sees as a product of these policies. She also highlights the skepticism and anxiety that surrounded the inception of race-based affirmative action programs and the dual perspectives on their purpose: the idealistic view of creating a diverse elite and the cynical view of socializing minorities to align with the existing power structures.

Overall, the author appears to appreciate the doors that affirmative action has opened while remaining critically aware of the ongoing challenges and the delicate balance that the beneficiaries must maintain in their personal and professional lives. She underscores the importance of these discussions for America's understanding and handling of race relations."	0.04096	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author references affirmative action as one of the reasons for conservative opposition to Goodwin Liu's nomination, implying that such opposition is unwarranted. By stating that Liu's views are within the legal and political mainstream, the author suggests that support for affirmative action is reasonable and should not impede his confirmation. This indicates that the author believes affirmative action is a legitimate and important consideration in the judicial system and society at large.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to reconsider several nominees for federal judgeships, including Goodwin Liu, due to Senate Republicans' refusal to allow a full Senate vote and their invocation of a rule requiring renomination. Liu is a law professor with an impressive background, and his potential for a Supreme Court nomination is thought to be a reason for opposition from conservatives, who disagree with his views on same-sex marriage rights, affirmative action, and the evolving interpretation of the Constitution. Despite accusations of being a liberal ideologue, Liu has shown varied perspectives, earning support from figures like Kenneth Starr. The author urges Republican committee members to support the nominees and criticizes the lower confirmation rate of President Obama's nominees compared to those of President Bush.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to support affirmative action as they mention it as one of the reasons conservatives oppose Goodwin Liu, implying that the opposition is unjustified. The author notes that Liu's views, including his support for affirmative action, are within the legal and political mainstream, suggesting that the author believes such views are reasonable and should not be a barrier to his confirmation. The author's stance indicates a belief in the legitimacy and importance of affirmative action within the judicial system and broader society."	0.01975	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text. The text primarily discusses the controversy surrounding Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, as well as the impact of the situation on Thomas's personal and professional life. While the author does mention Clarence Thomas's criticism of affirmative action, there is not enough information in the summary to determine the author's own stance on affirmative action with certainty. The summary indicates that the author may share some of Thomas's views on affirmative action, but without more explicit commentary on the policy itself, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance definitively.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 1991 controversy surrounding Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. The author expresses skepticism about the scandal, questioning the severity of the allegations and Hill's delayed reaction. The piece also touches upon the recent actions of Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginni Thomas, who left a voicemail for Anita Hill asking for an apology, which reignited public interest in the case. Additionally, the author mentions Lillian McEwen, a former girlfriend of Thomas, who corroborated Hill's claims and is releasing a memoir. The author describes Thomas's difficult personal history, as recounted in his memoir, and his journey to becoming a respected member of the Supreme Court. The author concludes by expressing hope that Thomas has the spiritual strength to endure this renewed scrutiny and that he can forgive his wife for her actions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They suggest that Clarence Thomas's real ""offense"" was not the alleged sexual harassment but rather his conservative views, especially his criticism of affirmative action. The author implies that Thomas, as a conservative African American, faced harsher scrutiny because he opposed affirmative action, a policy generally supported by liberals. The author seems to agree with Thomas's view that affirmative action could ultimately harm those it is intended to help, indicating skepticism about the policy's effectiveness and potentially unintended consequences."	0.02634	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author's primary focus is on the political implications of Robert Bork's failed Supreme Court nomination and its impact on civil discourse and the confirmation process in American politics. The mention of affirmative action is brief and used to highlight Bork's legal philosophy rather than to offer a detailed analysis or opinion on the policy itself. The author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly articulated, and the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's perspective on the issue.	"Summary:
On October 23, 1987, Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate, with most Democrats voting against him. Bork was a highly qualified legal intellectual, known for his views on original intent, judicial restraint, and criticisms of Supreme Court rulings such as Roe v. Wade and affirmative action. The author suggests that the treatment of Bork's nomination marked the beginning of the end of civil discourse in American politics, leading to an era of obstructionism and personal attacks in the confirmation process. The article argues that the demonization of Bork was a strategic move by Democrats to prevent a conservative shift in the Supreme Court, even though some acknowledged the unfairness of their tactics. The author implies that the aggressive tactics used against Bork set a precedent for future political battles and that the current conservative majority in the Supreme Court and the contentious political climate can trace their origins back to the Bork nomination fight.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author refers to Bork's criticism of the Supreme Court's rulings on affirmative action as ""problematic,"" suggesting that Bork had reservations about the court's decisions in this area. The author does not explicitly state their own view on affirmative action but implies that Bork's perspective was part of a broader conservative judicial philosophy that emphasized original intent and judicial restraint. The reference to affirmative action is brief and serves to illustrate Bork's legal positions, which were part of the controversy surrounding his nomination. The author's main focus is on the political ramifications of the nomination process rather than the specific legal doctrines such as affirmative action."	0.027970000000000002	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Clarence Page, does not focus extensively on affirmative action but does express support for the concept of diversity, which is a key goal of affirmative action policies. His defense of the value of diversity and his critique of Jonah Goldberg's sarcastic remarks about the NBA suggest that he sees diversity as a strength and is critical of those who mock the mechanisms that promote it. While the text does not provide a comprehensive view of Page's stance on affirmative action, the context implies that he is at least somewhat in favor of the principle of diversity in society, which affirmative action seeks to enhance.	"Summary:
Clarence Page critiques Jonah Goldberg's book ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" which targets political cliches often used by liberals. Page acknowledges that some cliches are problematic but argues that others contain wisdom. He appreciates the succinct truth in sayings like ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer"" and criticizes Goldberg's flippant treatment of serious issues such as wrongful convictions. Page also defends the value of diversity and challenges the dismissal of one person's freedom fighter as another's terrorist. To balance the discussion, Page lists cliches commonly used by conservatives that he finds annoying.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
While the text provided does not delve deeply into affirmative action, the author, Clarence Page, briefly touches upon the topic when discussing the cliche ""Diversity is strength."" Page seems to support the idea that diversity, which affirmative action aims to promote, has been beneficial for the country. He suggests that the United States has prospered because of its diverse population and the ability of different groups to work together. Page's perspective appears to be that diversity, potentially achieved through affirmative action, is a strength rather than a weakness, contrary to Goldberg's sarcastic remark about the NBA having quotas for midgets and one-legged point guards."	0.025580000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the letters each express views that are generally supportive of affirmative action, though they have nuanced positions on its implementation and focus. Mallory Duncan and Michael Farzan are in favor of affirmative action, with Duncan emphasizing the need to correct historical biases and Farzan suggesting an expansion to include economic status. Tom O'Hare's stance is more complex; he advocates for equal treatment, which could be interpreted as a critique of affirmative action's race-based approach, but it is not explicitly against the concept itself. Tom Barnard supports the idea of affirmative action but questions the administration's inconsistency in applying it to gender but not race. Overall, the authors are either somewhat in favor or strongly in favor of affirmative action, with specific concerns about its current execution and scope.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize race as a factor in college admissions. Mallory Duncan from Paris highlights that colleges have historically given preferential treatment to legacies, athletes, and those from underrepresented states, often benefiting white students of a certain socioeconomic class. Duncan notes that when affirmative action shifted to include students of color and economically disadvantaged students, only these groups were labeled as beneficiaries of affirmative action, and they are now the ones being targeted by the administration.

Michael Farzan from Juno Beach, FL, criticizes President Trump for appealing to white resentment and suggests that affirmative action should also consider economic status to address social mobility issues more effectively.

Tom O'Hare from Boston argues for equal treatment of African-Americans and Latinos in college admissions and other areas, stating that continuing to condescend to individuals based on race perpetuates historical injustices.

Tom Barnard from Shaker Heights, Ohio, questions why the administration is against using race for diversity in education but not gender, pointing out that men are often accepted with lower scores to maintain gender balance, despite there being no history of discrimination against men in education.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The authors of the letters each have their own perspectives on affirmative action:

1. Mallory Duncan seems to support affirmative action as a means to correct historical biases and promote diversity in higher education. Duncan criticizes the current administration for singling out students of color as the sole beneficiaries of affirmative action, ignoring the historical advantages given to other groups.

2. Michael Farzan views affirmative action as a necessary tool to improve social mobility but suggests that it should be expanded to include economic status. Farzan believes that addressing economic disparities would undermine the divisive politics of the Trump administration.

3. Tom O'Hare calls for equal treatment and opportunity for all individuals, regardless of race. O'Hare's perspective suggests that affirmative action based on race is condescending and that it does not acknowledge the full potential of individuals.

4. Tom Barnard questions the consistency of the administration's stance on diversity, supporting the use of affirmative action for gender but not for race. Barnard's view implies that affirmative action should be applied fairly across different aspects of diversity, including both race and gender."	0.030920000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt	0
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective, as evidenced by the text summary, is supportive of measures to address historical and contemporary injustices faced by black Americans, including affirmative action. The author explicitly challenges views that diminish the need for such measures, pointing to ongoing issues like housing discrimination, police violence, wage gaps, healthcare inequities, and the Flint water crisis as evidence that the legacy of slavery continues to affect black Americans. The advocacy for reparations and the criticism of those who believe past civil rights legislation is sufficient suggest the author is in favor of proactive steps to address racial disparities.	"Summary:
The text discusses the presentation of arguments for reparations for black Americans in front of a House Judiciary panel. The hearing, held on Juneteenth, addressed H.R. 40, a proposal by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee to authorize a study of reparations for slavery. Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to slavery as a period of ""torture, rape, and child trafficking."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposed reparations, suggesting that past civil rights legislation and the election of Barack Obama as president were sufficient responses to the legacy of slavery. The author of the text challenges this view, highlighting ongoing issues such as housing discrimination, police violence, wage gaps, healthcare inequities, and the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The author argues that the legacy of slavery continues to affect black Americans and that reparations are a necessary step towards healing.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, seeing it as a necessary response to ongoing discrimination and inequality. They express frustration at those who believe affirmative action is no longer needed, pointing to the ""shrugging of shoulders"" and ""eye rolls"" from people who dismiss the need for measures to address racial disparities. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is part of a broader acknowledgment and redress of the historical and contemporary injustices faced by black Americans. They advocate for a recognition of the harm caused by slavery and its continuing impact, suggesting that reparations and other forms of support are essential for healing and progress."	0.027219999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective, as presented in the summary, indicates a nuanced view on affirmative action. While recognizing the current role of affirmative action in higher education, the author suggests a transition to race-neutral admissions policies in the future. This indicates a belief in the potential for progress towards a system where race is not a factor, which implies a stance that is not fully in favor of permanent affirmative action policies but acknowledges their current necessity. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'somewhat in favor,' as he advocates for a middle path and eventual evolution away from race-based considerations.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's hearing of challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It references the divided public opinion on affirmative action, as shown by a Pew Research Center survey, and the fact that affirmative action is banned in nine states. The text includes excerpts from guest essays with varying perspectives on affirmative action: Justin Driver suggests a middle path for institutions to adapt to race-neutral admissions, Linda Greenhouse reflects on the ongoing debates over the meaning of Brown v. Board of Education, and Renu Mukherjee argues against affirmative action from a personal standpoint, advocating for race-neutral alternatives. The essays aim to provide insights into the future of higher education, the Supreme Court, and the country.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Justin Driver, the author of one of the guest essays, appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. He acknowledges the role it has played in higher education but suggests that there is a timeline, as indicated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in Grutter v. Bollinger, after which racial preferences may no longer be necessary. Driver's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is not a permanent solution but a temporary measure that should eventually lead to race-neutral admissions policies. He implies that institutions should use the remaining time to adapt and transition to such policies. This perspective indicates a belief in the potential for progress toward a system where race does not need to be a factor in college admissions, while still recognizing the current role of affirmative action."	0.030240000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt	0
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author discusses the efforts of UC Irvine to promote diversity and the establishment of a Diversity Council, which suggests a positive view of efforts to increase diversity, typically associated with support for affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action, they highlight the university's diversity outreach and the local support for programs that encourage interethnic dialogue. The author's acknowledgment of the contentious nature of affirmative action debates and the mention of opposition to race-based preferences by Ward Connerly without direct criticism suggest a moderate position. The author's focus on diversity as a valuable asset and the need for improvement in faculty diversity implies a recognition of the goals of affirmative action without strong advocacy for or against it.	"Summary:
UC Irvine has been actively engaged in efforts to promote diversity on its campus, led by Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. Over the past eight months, the university has been evaluating its diversity initiatives and is in the process of establishing a Diversity Council to further support diversity, especially among its faculty. These efforts have been timely, as they coincide with discussions about affirmative action, particularly in light of UC Regent Ward Connerly's opposition to race-based preferences. The campus has been recognized for its diversity outreach, both within the university—where it boasts a high percentage of Asian students—and in the community, where UCI graduates have contributed to diversity efforts, such as the creation of a cultural mural in Huntington Beach. The Orange County Annual Survey indicates strong local support for programs that foster interethnic dialogue, aligning with Chancellor Wilkening's view that diversity is a valuable asset for the university.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a complex and sometimes contentious issue but distinguishes it from the broader concept of diversity. They acknowledge that conversations about affirmative action can become heated and intertwined with discussions about diversity. The author suggests that while UCI has made strides in promoting diversity, there is still room for improvement, especially in hiring and promoting a more diverse faculty. The author seems to support the idea of affirmative action as a means to enhance diversity and to address the need for dialogue and understanding among different ethnic groups within the community. The mention of Ward Connerly's opposition to race-based preferences indicates that the author is aware of the debate surrounding affirmative action but does not explicitly state their personal stance on Connerly's position. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of diversity and the positive steps taken by UCI to foster an inclusive environment."	0.024829999999999998	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt	0
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to have a balanced view of affirmative action, recognizing both the right to oppose it and the complexity of factors influencing minority achievement. The criticism of Graglia's remarks for not considering socioeconomic and historical contexts, as well as the call for an open dialogue on race issues, suggests that the author believes in the value of affirmative action but also sees the need for a more nuanced discussion about its implementation and impact. The author does not outright endorse or reject affirmative action but emphasizes understanding and dialogue, which indicates a perspective that is neither strongly for nor against but rather somewhere in the middle, possibly leaning towards support due to the recognition of broader factors affecting minority achievement.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversial remarks made by University of Texas at Austin law Professor Lino Graglia, who claimed that Blacks and Mexican-Americans are not academically competitive with whites in selective institutions and have a culture that does not encourage achievement. His comments sparked outrage among politicians, students, and his own colleagues, with calls for his dismissal and debates about the limits of academic freedom. The author acknowledges that Graglia's concerns about minority underachievement have some basis, as noted by scholars like Thomas Sowell, but criticizes Graglia for suggesting that minority underachievement is an inherent trait rather than considering socioeconomic and historical factors. The author argues for the importance of dialogue and education on race issues, and criticizes President Clinton for not being open to a variety of perspectives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to take a nuanced view on affirmative action. While recognizing Graglia's right to oppose affirmative action, the author suggests that Graglia's approach was flawed because he implied that minorities are inherently underachievers. The text implies that factors such as socioeconomic circumstances, the convergence of race and poverty, and historical discrimination should be considered when discussing minority achievement. The author believes in the importance of dialogue and the inclusion of various viewpoints to address public policy questions, including those related to affirmative action. The author also points out the need for understanding and patience in discussions that may involve hurt feelings, indicating that a society should be willing to engage in complex conversations about sensitive issues like affirmative action."	0.027	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	0
1	somewhat_against	The author of the critique is critical of 'The Bell Curve' and its stance on affirmative action, suggesting that the book's recommendation to abolish affirmative action is driven by a conservative political agenda rather than empirical evidence. The critique positions the author as disapproving of the use of IQ scores to justify the elimination of affirmative action, which is seen as a policy to address social inequalities. This criticism indicates that the author disagrees with the book's position on affirmative action and views it as a regressive step.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which has sparked significant controversy due to its discussion of racial differences in IQ scores. The author of the critique suggests that the book may be more about generating profit and pushing a conservative agenda than contributing new scientific insights. The book's claims are compared to those of William Shockley, who decades earlier attributed social disparities to genetic differences in intelligence and advocated for eugenic policies. ""The Bell Curve"" is accused of reiterating Shockley's ideas with a modern political spin, including the suggestion to abolish affirmative action and welfare. The text also criticizes the book for lacking original ideas on welfare reform and for being padded with disclaimers and graphs to appear authoritative. The authors of ""The Bell Curve"" are also critiqued for claiming expertise outside their fields and for attempting to make the book accessible to a wide audience while preserving a sense of intellectual elitism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the critique appears to be critical of ""The Bell Curve"" authors' stance on affirmative action. The text implies that Murray and Herrnstein's suggestion to abolish affirmative action is part of a conservative political agenda rather than a conclusion drawn from solid scientific evidence. The author's perspective suggests a skepticism of the book's motives and a disapproval of the use of IQ test score differentials to justify the elimination of policies like affirmative action that aim to address social inequalities. The critique indicates that the author views the book's position on affirmative action as regressive and unhelpful in the broader discussion of welfare and social reform."	0.02753	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt	0

3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Clarence Page, does not directly address affirmative action, but his defense of diversity and recognition of the benefits that different ethnicities bring to America imply a perspective that aligns with the principles of affirmative action. His critique of Jonah Goldberg's book and the defense of the idea that 'Diversity is strength' indicate a positive view of inclusion and representation, which are key components of affirmative action policies. Therefore, while the text does not provide an explicit stance on affirmative action, the author's views on related concepts suggest a favorable disposition towards it.	"Summary:
Clarence Page critiques Jonah Goldberg's book, ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" which laments the use of cliches in political discourse, particularly by liberals. Page acknowledges that some cliches are problematic but also finds value in the succinct truths they can convey. He challenges Goldberg's dismissal of certain cliches such as ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer,"" by pointing out the real-world implications of wrongful convictions highlighted by the Innocence Project. Page also defends the idea that diversity is a strength, citing America's history of different ethnicities working together. He even turns the tables by listing cliches commonly used by conservatives, suggesting that cliched thinking is not exclusive to any one political side.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not delve deeply into affirmative action, Page seems to have a positive view of diversity and its benefits to the country. He criticizes Goldberg's sarcastic take on the phrase ""Diversity is strength,"" indirectly supporting the principle behind affirmative action—that a mix of backgrounds contributes to the nation's prosperity. Page's position suggests that he values the inclusion and representation of different groups in society, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action policies."	0.02497	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes the superficial application of affirmative action policies, highlighting the importance of genuine diversity of experiences rather than an overemphasis on distant ethnic connections. The text suggests that affirmative action, as implemented in elite academic institutions, may not effectively serve the populations it's intended to help and may overlook other significant aspects of diversity such as socioeconomic status. The author's critique indicates a nuanced view that is skeptical of the current practices of affirmative action but does not necessarily oppose the concept in its entirety. Therefore, the author appears to be somewhat against the way affirmative action is currently practiced, but not against the principle of promoting diversity itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority, specifically Native American, during her academic career. Warren, a Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, cited family lore about high cheekbones being indicative of Native American ancestry as part of her personal narrative. However, genealogical evidence failed to confirm her Cherokee heritage. The author reflects on a similar personal experience of believing in Native American ancestry without concrete evidence. The text criticizes the academic culture that emphasizes distant ethnic connections to demonstrate a commitment to diversity, arguing that it leads to superficial diversity rather than a genuine variety of experiences and perspectives. The author suggests that Warren's working-class background is a more authentic contributor to diversity than her claimed Native American heritage.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action as it is practiced within elite academic institutions, suggesting that it often results in a superficial form of diversity that prioritizes ethnic quotas over true diversity of experience and perspective. The author points out the absurdity of touting distant ethnic connections as a diversity achievement and highlights the need for a more serious approach to academic diversity. The text suggests that affirmative action programs sometimes benefit groups (like West Indian immigrants) more than those they were ostensibly designed to help (like descendants of slaves). Additionally, the author notes that the current definitions of diversity can overlook significant aspects of an individual's background, such as socioeconomic status, in favor of minor ethnic heritage. The author calls for colleges and universities to rethink their approach to diversity to avoid the pitfalls of cosmetic diversity that do not reflect the complex, multifaceted identities of individuals in an increasingly diverse America."	0.02895	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Drew Westen, does not directly express his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. His focus is on the broader political landscape and the role of vision in presidential politics. While he mentions Reagan's appeal to voters concerned about affirmative action, he does not offer a clear opinion on the policy itself. Instead, he critiques the politicization of the issue. Without explicit evidence of Westen's support or opposition to affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize his stance.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the importance of having a vision in American presidential politics, drawing a parallel between Franklin D. Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression and the lack of a clear vision from either Mitt Romney or Barack Obama during their presidential campaigns. The author, Drew Westen, criticizes Republicans for empty promises on small government and fiscal responsibility, noting past failures to implement such policies. Westen also points out Obama's contradictory stance of pushing for stimulus while planning budget cuts. He attributes the absence of a bold vision from either candidate to their cautious nature, the influence of money in politics, and the enduring impact of Ronald Reagan's ideology. Reagan's presidency is characterized as one that resonated with voters on concerns about government size and racial issues, but ultimately led to increased inequality and corruption. Westen concludes by suggesting that the failure to move beyond Reagan's ideology has left working- and middle-class Americans struggling, and he highlights the importance of a compelling vision, as evidenced by George H.W. Bush's one-term presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Drew Westen, seems critical of the way affirmative action has been politicized and used as a divisive issue in American politics. He describes Reagan's appeal to white working-class males who felt threatened by affirmative action, suggesting that Reagan played on their fears and anger. Westen implies that affirmative action was part of a broader social change that left certain demographics feeling alienated. His perspective indicates a belief that the political exploitation of affirmative action has contributed to societal divisions and has been used as a tool to gain political support from specific voter bases, rather than addressing the policy's intentions and impact in a constructive manner."	0.03107	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action in the text. They focus on the integrity of the Supreme Court's decision-making process and the potential influence of political considerations on judicial decisions. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of it being a subject of future Supreme Court cases, without any indication of the author's personal views on the policy. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reactions to Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion in the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius case, where the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act as a tax. The author notes that many commentators suggest Roberts was motivated by a desire to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of the Supreme Court, given the political climate in Washington. The author raises concerns about whether Roberts would have voted differently if he were not the Chief Justice, highlighting a potential conflict between his role and his judicial philosophy. The text compares this situation to the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, where the Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. The author references Justice Scalia's dissent in that case, which criticizes the idea of basing decisions on public perception. The author also comments on the perceived imbalance in questioning the integrity of conservative versus liberal justices and the constraints of a conservative judicial philosophy. The possibility that Roberts's decision was a strategic move to gain political capital for future cases, including those on affirmative action, gay marriage, and the Voting Rights Act, is also mentioned.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action in the provided text, they do reference it in the context of future Supreme Court cases that the Roberts Court might confront. The reference implies that affirmative action is among the ""hot-button issues"" that could be influenced by the political capital that Chief Justice Roberts may have earned through his decision in the health care case. The author's concern seems to be more about the integrity of the Court's decision-making process and the potential for decisions to be swayed by political considerations, rather than the specific merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. The author seems to advocate for judicial decisions to be made based on legal correctness rather than political strategy or public perception, as highlighted by the citation of Justice Scalia's viewpoint."	0.0298	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	John S. Rosenberg's critique of the Obama administration's support for affirmative action in university admissions indicates a clear opposition to the policy. He argues that considering race as a factor in admissions is contradictory to American values of treating individuals without regard to race, and he likens the administration's justification to a paradoxical and self-defeating strategy. His use of strong language and analogies suggests a firm stance against the policy.	"Summary:
The author, John S. Rosenberg, is critiquing the Obama administration's stance on affirmative action, which was presented to the Supreme Court. The administration supports the idea of universities considering race as one factor in a holistic review process during admissions to promote diversity. Rosenberg argues that this approach still results in the admission or rejection of students based on their race or ethnicity, which he sees as a contradiction to American values of treating individuals without regard to race. He highlights that the administration justifies this practice by stating that it is essential for ensuring that careers vital to the national interest are accessible to all segments of society. Rosenberg compares this justification to the paradoxical military strategy of destroying a village to save it, implying that the administration's argument is self-defeating.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Rosenberg's perspective on affirmative action is highly critical. He views the policy as inherently discriminatory because it involves making decisions based on race or ethnicity. He believes that such practices contradict the principle of equal treatment without regard to race, which he considers a fundamental American value. Rosenberg suggests that the administration's argument is illogical and self-contradictory, as it advocates for racial discrimination in order to promote careers that are supposedly open to everyone regardless of race. He uses a vivid analogy to emphasize the absurdity he sees in the administration's position, indicating that affirmative action, as it is being defended, undermines the very principles it claims to uphold."	0.0189	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred from their discussion of Chief Justice John Roberts's stance rather than explicitly stated. However, the author's focus on Roberts's skepticism about racial quotas and the expectation that he will vote against the university's affirmative action policies suggests that the author may share a similar viewpoint. The reference to Roberts's history of supporting 'true equality and ending discrimination' implies a belief that affirmative action policies are discriminatory. The author's perspective seems to align with a conservative viewpoint, which typically opposes affirmative action on the grounds that it constitutes reverse discrimination. While the author does not explicitly state their own stance, the framing of the issue suggests a perspective that is at least somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which deals with the issue of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims she was denied admission to the university because of her race, while the university argues that it considers race to achieve a diverse student body. Chief Justice John Roberts, who previously sided with the liberal wing of the court to uphold ObamaCare, showed during oral arguments that he may not consistently align with the liberal justices. His questioning suggested skepticism about the university's policies regarding racial quotas. Tejinder Singh from SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission both believe that Roberts is likely to vote in favor of Fisher, indicating he has not shifted his conservative stance on issues of equality and discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a perspective that Chief Justice John Roberts is likely to oppose affirmative action policies, as indicated by his line of questioning during the Fisher case and his history of conservative rulings on similar issues. The author references Roberts's previous decisions, which Todd Gaziano interprets as supporting ""true equality and ending discrimination,"" suggesting that Roberts views affirmative action as a form of discrimination rather than a tool for achieving diversity. The tone of the text implies that the author expects Roberts to maintain a conservative approach to affirmative action, rather than aligning with more liberal perspectives that may support such policies."	0.02148	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the historical importance and success of policies like the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action in securing rights and opportunities for African Americans. However, the author also points out unintended consequences such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering. This perspective indicates an understanding of the complexities and trade-offs associated with such policies. The author does not express outright opposition to affirmative action but rather suggests a nuanced view that recognizes both its positive intentions and its potential downsides. This balance suggests that the author may be in favor of the original goals of affirmative action but also supports a reevaluation of its current implementation to address contemporary issues.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), particularly focusing on Section 5, which mandates pre-clearance of election rules by the Justice Department for certain jurisdictions. The author acknowledges the VRA's historical success in securing voting rights for African Americans but points out its unintended consequences, such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering, which can limit the political influence of minorities. The author notes that while overt voter suppression has decreased, the VRA's relevance is still evident in its role in checking discriminatory voter ID laws. The 2006 reauthorization of the VRA by Congress did not address these contemporary issues, and the Supreme Court has shown concern over the VRA's real-world impacts. The author suggests that a Supreme Court ruling against pre-clearance might provoke a necessary debate on how to balance the protection of voting rights with the need to restore political moderation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author draws a parallel between affirmative action in universities and the creation of ""opportunity districts"" under the VRA, suggesting that both have played a role in building a middle class and a cadre of black elected officials after segregation. The author seems to understand the rationale behind affirmative action as a means to address past injustices and create opportunities for minority groups. However, the author also implies that there may be drawbacks to such policies, as they can lead to political and social divisions. The comparison suggests that the author views affirmative action as well-intentioned but also recognizes that it can have complex and potentially negative side effects, similar to those observed with the VRA."	0.0285	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The summary focuses on the voting patterns and dynamics of the U.S. Supreme Court justices, specifically highlighting the cohesiveness of the three female justices and their liberal ideologies. While the article mentions that the justices sometimes diverged on significant cases, including those related to affirmative action, it does not offer an evaluation or opinion on the policy itself. Instead, it reports on the justices' decisions and the implications of those decisions. The author's own stance on affirmative action is not discernible from the text provided.	"Summary:
The article discusses the voting patterns and dynamics of the U.S. Supreme Court justices during a recent term. It highlights that the three female justices—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—voted together at least 93% of the time, making them the most cohesive group on the court. Their alignment is attributed to their liberal ideologies rather than their gender. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, another liberal justice, notably diverged from this group in some privacy cases, indicating a rightward shift in his positions. The conservative justices, on the other hand, showed more fragmentation in their voting. The article also touches on the individual contributions of the female justices during court arguments and their public engagements outside the court. Justice Sotomayor, in particular, received attention for her memoir and public appearances. The justices' votes are not entirely predictable, as they sometimes diverged on significant cases, including those related to same-sex marriage and affirmative action. Justice Kagan recused herself from the affirmative action case due to prior involvement as solicitor general.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author notes that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor had differing views on affirmative action. Justice Ginsburg was the lone dissenter in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's affirmative action plan back to lower courts under a stricter standard. This suggests that Ginsburg was supportive of affirmative action and wanted to uphold the University of Texas's plan without further scrutiny. Justice Sotomayor's position on the issue is not explicitly stated in the text, but the mention of a split indicates she may have had a different view from Ginsburg. The author does not explicitly express their own perspective on affirmative action but provides information on the justices' positions to illustrate their ideological differences and the complexity of their votes."	0.03338	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not addressed in the summary provided. The text focuses on reactions to Donald Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA due to racist remarks and broader discussions on race and racism. The mention of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling related to affirmative action is only a backdrop to these discussions and does not reflect the author's personal stance on the policy. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on this summary.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the reaction to the lifetime ban of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA, following the release of an audiotape where Sterling made racist remarks. The ban was praised by Lawrence Tolliver, a South Los Angeles barbershop owner, and others in the community. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the ban after confirming that it was Sterling's voice on the tape, where Sterling chastised a female friend for associating with black people and told her not to bring them to his games. The incident sparked a conversation on race at Tolliver's barbershop, where people expressed their views on racial progress and the persistent issues of racism. Some highlighted the casual use of racial slurs in popular culture, while others saw Sterling's actions as emblematic of deeper racial issues. The barbershop patrons agreed on the progress made on race but acknowledged that much work remains. The text also mentions the NAACP's retracted plan to honor Sterling and the suspicion that his donations were more about image than compassion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss their personal perspective on affirmative action in the provided text. However, they mention a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests a readiness to move beyond affirmative action, which serves as a backdrop to the discussion on race and racism in the context of the Donald Sterling scandal. The text focuses more on the community's reaction to Sterling's racist remarks and the broader conversation on race relations rather than on affirmative action as a policy."	0.02978	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as indicated by the text summary. While the author acknowledges the complexity and sensitivity of the issue, they support the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policies and suggest that the top 10 percent policy alone is not sufficient due to existing segregation. The author's call for the Supreme Court to affirm the university's approach and provide clearer guidelines indicates a belief in the legitimacy and necessity of affirmative action within constitutional limits.	"Summary:
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policy, which the Supreme Court had previously asked to be re-evaluated. The policy fills most seats through a state policy that guarantees admission to students in the top 10 percent of their high school class, which indirectly promotes racial diversity due to segregation patterns in Texas schools. The remaining seats are filled through a holistic review process where race can be a minor consideration. The 5th Circuit's decision supports the university's approach, noting it aligns with the individualized review the Supreme Court has required for race-conscious admissions. Opponents argue that the top 10 percent policy is sufficient for diversity, but the university and the 5th Circuit believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary due to the limitations of the top 10 percent policy and the ongoing segregation in schools.

Author's Perspective:
The author's perspective is supportive of affirmative action, specifically the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policies. The author acknowledges the complexity and sensitivity of using race as a factor in admissions but argues that the university's program is a well-designed example of how affirmative action can work within constitutional boundaries. They point out that the top 10 percent policy, while helpful in promoting diversity, is not a comprehensive solution due to its reliance on existing racial segregation in schools. The author also calls for the Supreme Court to provide clearer guidelines on what constitutes a constitutionally acceptable affirmative-action program and to affirm the university's approach as permissible. The tone suggests that the author views affirmative action as a necessary and cautious effort to create a diverse educational environment that prepares students for a multi-ethnic society."	0.02482	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	1
	None	The summary provided does not mention affirmative action or any topics directly related to affirmative action policies or debates. The focus of the summary is on the handling of sexual assault cases at universities, the involvement of the U.S. Department of Education, and due process concerns. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given text.	"Summary:
This text discusses the controversy surrounding a rape accusation at Columbia University, where Emma Sulkowicz accused Paul Nungesser of rape and carried a mattress around campus to protest the university's decision not to expel him after he was cleared by a campus tribunal. The debate intensified when The Daily Beast published an interview with Nungesser and included evidence that seemed to challenge Sulkowicz's story. The media's role in the case is questioned, given that Sulkowicz sought media attention after the university cleared Nungesser. The text also criticizes the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) for pressuring universities to handle sexual assault cases internally with guidelines that many believe compromise due process. The author suggests universities should demand a rethinking of these guidelines, clarify the definition of sexual misconduct, adhere to a ""reasonable-person test,"" and collaborate with local law enforcement instead of operating their own adjudication systems.

Author's Perspective:
The author, Judith Shulevitz, appears to be critical of the current approach to handling campus sexual assault cases, particularly the role of the U.S. government and the Department of Education in dictating university procedures. Shulevitz questions the efficacy and fairness of campus tribunals, which are seen as lacking in due process and credibility. She argues that the guidelines provided by the D.O.E. force schools to infringe on the civil rights of the accused and suggests that universities should push back against these guidelines, seek clearer definitions of sexual misconduct, and adopt standards that align with due process. Additionally, Shulevitz advocates for a more collaborative approach with local law enforcement to better address sexual violence, rather than relying on university-run systems that are prone to criticism and may not be equipped to handle such complex legal matters."	0.03175	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, William G. Bowen, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. However, he does differentiate affirmative action from other issues by noting that it has a 'very different claim on academia' and directly affects educational processes and outcomes. This suggests that he acknowledges the relevance and importance of affirmative action in the context of higher education. Since he contrasts it with other issues that he believes universities should not take a stance on, it can be inferred that he views affirmative action as a legitimate area where universities should be involved. However, without a clear endorsement or rejection of affirmative action policies, we cannot accurately determine if he is in favor or against it. Therefore, we categorize his stance as 'neutral' based on the information provided.	"Summary:
William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, discusses the resurgence of divestment campaigns in higher education, particularly those targeting fossil fuel company holdings. He presents several arguments commonly made against divestment, such as its potential negative impact on endowment performance, the complexity of fully divesting from certain financial instruments, and doubts about its effectiveness in changing corporate behavior. Bowen finds these arguments convincing but acknowledges that they should be debated in specific contexts.

Bowen is critical of the notion that universities are obligated to take a stand on every issue of broad social concern, arguing that abstention is a legitimate stance when an issue does not directly relate to an institution's educational mission. He believes that universities should maintain an open environment for all viewpoints and avoid institutional partisanship, which could compromise their educational mission. He contrasts issues like affirmative action, which directly affects education, with issues that are less central to a university's function, such as international conflicts.

Bowen's main concern is the moral perils of divestment. He criticizes potential hypocrisy in seeking institutional purity without individual action, the responsibility to honor donor intent regarding endowment funds, the risk of substituting institutional actions for individual civic responsibility, and the need for educational institutions to focus on improving educational outcomes and affordability. He argues that divestment campaigns can distract from these core educational missions and warns against the slippery slope of using divestment as a political tactic.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bowen views affirmative action as an issue with a ""very different claim on academia"" compared to other social or political issues because it directly affects educational processes and outcomes. He implies that affirmative action is integral to the educational mission of universities, and therefore, it is appropriate for them to take a position on it. Bowen's perspective suggests that he sees affirmative action as a matter of educational policy and practice, which is central to the role and function of higher education institutions, as opposed to other issues that may be important but do not have the same direct impact on education."	0.03197	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action within the provided text. The summary indicates that he acknowledges the complexity of the issue, particularly in the context of drafting university policies that might intersect with the principles of affirmative action. However, since the focus of the text is on hate speech and the challenges of creating a policy that balances free speech with the prevention of hate speech, and not on affirmative action itself, it is not possible to categorize his stance on affirmative action based on the information given.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, discusses the challenges the University of California (UC) regents face in creating a hate-speech policy. Recent anti-Semitic incidents prompted the regents to consider adopting ""principles against intolerance,"" but they have yet to finalize a policy and instead formed a committee to revisit the issue. The difficulty lies in balancing the protection of free speech with the prevention of hate speech. Previous attempts at defining hate speech at state universities have been struck down for being too vague and violating the First Amendment. The text also addresses the complexities involved in defining anti-Semitism, particularly with respect to criticism of Israel.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky touches upon affirmative action when discussing the potential implications of a hate-speech policy. He raises the question of whether advocacy for affirmative action could be misconstrued as stigmatizing racial minorities by suggesting they need preferential treatment to compete. This concern indicates that the author is aware of the nuanced debate surrounding affirmative action and recognizes that policies intended to protect individuals from discrimination can sometimes be interpreted as discriminatory themselves. However, the author does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action within this text. Instead, his focus is on the broader issue of how universities can draft policies that respect free speech while also defining and prohibiting unprotected speech, such as threats or harassment."	0.025259999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text provided. The text focuses on the broader concept of 'the politics of self-esteem' and how moral issues, including affirmative action, contribute to this phenomenon. The author examines how political engagement in moral issues provides psychic benefits and a sense of moral superiority to individuals, but they do not directly express a stance for or against affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the information given.	"Summary:
The text discusses the concept of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals engage in political activities to boost their self-esteem. This trend is seen across the political spectrum and has been amplified by Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Trump's controversial statements and proposals, such as banning Muslim immigrants, have paradoxically increased his popularity among Republicans due to his defiance of established norms. The author argues that politics has shifted from economic struggles to moral issues, which are less conducive to compromise. Supporters of moral causes, both liberal and conservative, derive ""psychic benefits"" from their political engagement, feeling morally superior without needing legislative success. Trump's defiance against the ""political establishment"" and ""mainstream media"" provides psychic benefits to his supporters, enhancing their self-esteem. The author notes the dilemma faced by Trump's critics, as denouncing him often reinforces his appeal. The article concludes by reflecting on the challenges that the politics of self-esteem pose to political compromise and governance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author does not directly state their personal view on affirmative action, they include it in a list of issues that have become moral battlegrounds in contemporary politics. The author suggests that debates over affirmative action, like other moral issues, are highly charged and less amenable to compromise compared to economic issues. The implication is that affirmative action, as a moral and political issue, contributes to the politics of self-esteem by allowing individuals to align with a cause that provides them with a sense of moral superiority and psychic benefits, regardless of the practical outcomes or legislative progress. The author's focus is more on the effects of such issues on political discourse and self-perception rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.02786	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	1

The author's viewpoint on affirmative action is not discussed, and no opinion is expressed in the summary.	"Summary:
The text provided touches on a variety of significant events and issues that occurred in 2014 and 2015. It begins with Chief Justice Roberts' announcement that Supreme Court documents would be available online by 2016. It then recounts the tragic attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which resulted in the death of 12 people, including four cartoonists. The event raised questions about the limits of free speech. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained non-committal on the Republican plan for healthcare if the Supreme Court ruled against Obamacare. The mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston by Dylann Roof is mentioned, highlighting the ongoing issue of gun violence in the United States. Concerns over Donald Trump's potential negative impact on the Republican party's appeal to women voters are noted, and the Islamic State's atrocities against Yazidi women are reported. Various political events are mentioned, including Trump's proposal for a wall, a controversial UN appointment, Speaker John Boehner's resignation, and disagreements between President Obama and President Putin over Syria. The Supreme Court's new term is noted to include cases on abortion, religious rights, and affirmative action, with Justice Anthony Kennedy playing a pivotal role. The inconsistency of media descriptions of attackers in the U.S. is criticized, and Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants after the San Bernardino attacks is mentioned.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, clearly advocates for the expansion of affirmative action to include a 'serious poverty preference' in college admissions, highlighting the disparities that favor wealthy students. He argues for the inclusion of low-income students to ensure fairness and maintain ethnic diversity. Levy's support for affirmative action is focused on economic disparities and the use of affirmative action to correct those imbalances. His stance is in favor of adjusting affirmative action policies to help low-income students, indicating that he is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, particularly as a means to address socio-economic inequality.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of the New York City schools, discusses the disparities in college admissions that favor wealthy students. He reveals that only 3% of students at selective colleges come from the bottom 25% income families, while 72% come from the top 25%. Despite the fact that low-income students perform as well academically as their wealthy peers when admitted, they face significant disadvantages in the admissions process. Levy criticizes legacy preferences, athletic preferences skewed towards sports often played by the wealthy, and the disadvantages faced by low-income students in standardized testing and early-admissions programs. He also notes the inadequate college counseling support for low-income students. Levy argues for a ""serious poverty preference"" in admissions, which would serve as affirmative action for low-income students and also help maintain ethnic diversity in the face of potential Supreme Court rulings against race-conscious admissions policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy advocates for an expansion of affirmative action policies to specifically address the disadvantages faced by low-income students in college admissions. He argues that elite institutions should implement a ""poverty preference"" to level the playing field, ensuring that academically qualified low-income students have the opportunity to attend colleges that match their abilities. He believes that standardized tests should not be eliminated as they provide a common metric for comparison, but admissions officers should give more credit to low-income students who achieve high levels without the benefits of enrichment opportunities available to wealthier students. Levy's perspective is that true merit, not the wealth of one's parents, should be the basis for college admission, and affirmative action for low-income students is a necessary step to achieve that fairness."	0.028579999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors appear to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action, but with a specific focus on diversifying political perspectives within academia, particularly by increasing conservative representation. They support the concept of affirmative action when it is aimed at enhancing diversity of thought, which they argue is essential for the pursuit of truth in universities. Their perspective is not rooted in addressing historical injustices or demographic representation, but rather in balancing the political homogeneity that they perceive as problematic. While they do not endorse political quotas or preferences, they advocate for reforms that would make academia more welcoming to conservative viewpoints and suggest that these efforts are in line with the broader goals of affirmative action as it pertains to diversity.	"Summary:
The authors, both conservative professors, acknowledge that while they have defended universities against conservative criticism, they also recognize that academia is not immune to political biases. They highlight the underrepresentation of conservatives, particularly in the social sciences, where only a small percentage of professors identify as Republicans. This imbalance is attributed to conservative students avoiding social sciences and feeling uncomfortable in politically charged classroom environments. The authors note that conservative students and PhD candidates often select less politicized fields of study to avoid potential biases. They point out that economics is an exception, being more politically balanced. The authors argue that political homogeneity within academia can hinder the pursuit of truth due to a lack of diversity in perspectives and increased confirmation bias. They suggest that affirmative action, if aimed at increasing diversity of thought, should include efforts to increase conservative representation. They propose several reforms, such as inviting conservative speakers, hiring faculty with diverse viewpoints, and considering visiting appointments for scholars of conservative thought, to make academia more welcoming to conservatives and to strengthen the university's public legitimacy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors view affirmative action through the lens of diversity of thought rather than solely as a remedy for historical discrimination. They reference Justice Powell's opinion in the Bakke case, which emphasizes the discovery of truth through a ""multitude of tongues,"" suggesting that a variety of perspectives, including conservative ones, is essential for this purpose. The authors argue that universities have shifted their affirmative action rationale from remedial justice to the virtues of diversity, which has led to its application in contexts beyond historical grievances. They advocate for extending the diversity rationale to include political diversity, specifically the inclusion of conservative viewpoints in academia. However, the authors stop short of endorsing preferences in graduate admissions and hiring based on political ideology. Instead, they suggest more inclusive practices, such as not barring conservative speakers, questioning biases in hiring committees, and diversifying the curriculum to include fields that may attract conservative scholars. Through these measures, they believe universities can better adhere to their commitment to diversity and improve their legitimacy in a polarized society."	0.034519999999999995	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author clearly supports the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action policies, viewing the decision as a necessary step to ensure diversity in educational environments. They appreciate the benefits of a diverse student body and criticize the view that America is a colorblind society, implying that such policies are still needed to address ongoing inequalities and enhance the educational experience for all students. The author's critique of opposition to affirmative action and endorsement of the Court's ruling as a defining judgment further demonstrate a position that is in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's race-conscious admissions process, which considers race as one of many factors to promote diversity in its student body. The decision, ruled 4 to 3, is seen as a strong reaffirmation of the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education. The University of Texas uses a top 10 percent plan to automatically admit students from diverse high school backgrounds and a holistic review for the remaining spots. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, emphasized the need for universities to define their educational missions and the importance of diversity, while also ensuring that their policies are measurable and subject to review. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself, and Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away prior to the decision. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito expressed strong opposition to the use of race in admissions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective is in favor of affirmative action policies in university admissions. They view the Supreme Court's decision as a wise and necessary step to ensure that universities can create racially and ethnically diverse learning environments, which are seen as beneficial for the social and educational experience of all students. The author acknowledges that while affirmative action has been under constant attack, the Court's decision should be the defining judgment on the issue. The author criticizes the simplistic view that America is already a colorblind society and supports Justice Kennedy's rejection of this notion. The perspective is that affirmative action is a nuanced and essential tool for reflecting today's diverse America in educational institutions."	0.02641	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, Marilynne Rudick, criticizes the delay in the implementation of Maryland's medical marijuana program due to considerations for geographic diversity, which she associates with affirmative action. Rudick's frustration is evident as she emphasizes the need for the program to focus on its primary purpose of providing medical assistance rather than serving as an economic or affirmative action initiative. Her concern is with the timely availability of medical marijuana to patients, and she seems to believe that affirmative action is detracting from this goal. Therefore, her stance appears to be critical of affirmative action in this particular context, as she perceives it as a hindrance to the health objectives of the program.	"Summary:
Marilynne Rudick expresses frustration over the delays in the implementation of Maryland's medical marijuana program due to the latest controversy regarding geographic diversity in the awarding of licenses for cultivation. She is dismayed by the over two-year delay since the state legalized medical marijuana, emphasizing that as someone with multiple sclerosis, she is indifferent to the growers' identities or the locations of cultivation. Rudick criticizes Maryland politicians for losing sight of the law's primary purpose, which is to serve as a medical program, not an economic or affirmative action initiative. She urges politicians and regulators to expedite the process of making medical marijuana available to those in need.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Marilynne Rudick, seems to hold a critical view of affirmative action in the context of the medical marijuana program in Maryland. She implies that affirmative action considerations are part of the reason for the delay in the implementation of the program, which she believes should be solely focused on providing medical relief to patients. Rudick suggests that affirmative action is being inappropriately applied in this case, as she views the medical marijuana program as a health issue rather than an opportunity for economic development or social policy implementation. Her perspective is that the priority should be on the health needs of patients rather than on fulfilling affirmative action goals in the licensing process."	0.018099999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action in the text provided. The text focuses on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and the importance of understanding his judicial philosophy, particularly his originalist approach to the Constitution. While the author acknowledges that Gorsuch's confirmation could impact progressive causes, which may include affirmative action, there is no clear indication of the author's personal views on the matter. The emphasis is on the need for a substantive discussion of Gorsuch's views rather than an expression of the author's perspective on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. The author criticizes the expected partisan approaches to the hearings and suggests a more substantive discussion of Gorsuch's constitutional views and judicial philosophy. The author acknowledges the Democrats' anger over the Republicans' refusal to consider Merrick Garland, Obama's nominee, and anticipates Democratic concerns about Gorsuch's potential impact on progressive issues. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding Gorsuch's originalist approach to the Constitution, his respect for precedent, and how he might interpret the Constitution in the context of contemporary issues. The text highlights Gorsuch's qualifications and the need for the Senate to thoroughly examine his judicial philosophy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the text provided. However, there is a mention of concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, which includes affirmative action among other issues. The author seems to suggest that it is important for the Senate to question Gorsuch on his views and how his originalist interpretation of the Constitution might influence future rulings on such matters. The broader concern is whether Gorsuch, like Scalia, would interpret constitutional provisions strictly as they were understood at the time of their adoption or whether he would allow for their meanings to evolve to address contemporary social issues, which could include affirmative action. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not directly stated, but there is an implication that the author values the need for the Supreme Court to adapt to changing societal values, which could encompass a more expansive view of rights and protections, potentially including those related to affirmative action."	0.03148	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's discussion is centered on the issue of potential partisan bias in the wording of ballot initiative titles and summaries, not on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. While the author references affirmative action as an example of a politically charged issue that may be subject to manipulation in ballot language, there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action. The author's focus is on the integrity of the ballot initiative process and the need for nonpartisan language, rather than on affirmative action as a policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of ballot initiative titles in California being potentially influenced by partisan bias. A group of Republicans sued the state's Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, accusing him of giving a misleading title to their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees. The title given by Becerra's office was seen as clunky and intentionally opaque, potentially to weaken support for the measure. The author notes that this is a common complaint when an attorney general from one political party is responsible for writing the title and summary of a ballot initiative proposed by the opposing party. The text mentions past instances where former attorneys general, including Republicans and Democrats, faced similar accusations. The author suggests a solution to this problem: assigning the task of writing ballot titles and summaries to a nonpartisan third party, specifically the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), which has a reputation for producing clear and apolitical analyses. However, a recent proposal to implement this solution was opposed by Becerra and did not advance in the legislature.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context in which it is mentioned. The author cites the example of former Attorney General Dan Lungren choosing not to include the phrase ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209 as an instance of potential bias in ballot language. The author implies that the omission of such ""hot button words"" could have been a strategic decision to influence voters' perceptions of the measure. This example is used to illustrate the broader point that the language chosen for ballot initiatives can carry significant political weight and may be used to sway voters. The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, but they do seem critical of the possibility that important terms like ""affirmative action"" might be deliberately omitted from ballot summaries to serve political ends."	0.02837	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Bärí A. Williams, is concerned that the redefinition of diversity to emphasize cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity is undermining the efforts to increase representation of underrepresented groups in the tech industry. She highlights the importance of identity diversity, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action to correct imbalances in representation and promote equality for historically marginalized groups. Williams's advocacy for a traditional understanding of diversity that includes racial and gender differences indicates that she is in favor of affirmative action as a means to achieve these ends.	"Summary:
At an event about racial injustice, Denise Young Smith, Apple's VP of Diversity and Inclusion, made a controversial statement suggesting that a group of white men could also represent diversity due to their different life experiences and perspectives. Following backlash, she clarified her remarks, reiterating Apple's commitment to including women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and other underrepresented minorities. The author, Bärí A. Williams, argues that the tech industry's increasing focus on ""cognitive diversity"" dilutes efforts to address the lack of racial and gender diversity. She points out that tech companies have low percentages of black, Latino, and female employees, especially in leadership roles. Williams worries that redefining diversity to prioritize cognitive diversity could undermine the recruitment of underrepresented racial and gender groups. She emphasizes the importance of identity diversity and cautions against letting the pursuit of diverse viewpoints overshadow the need to include people from underrepresented communities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses concern that the concept of diversity in the tech industry is being redefined to focus on cognitive and viewpoint diversity at the expense of racial and gender diversity. While acknowledging the importance of diverse perspectives, she fears that this shift could serve as a loophole to avoid addressing the low representation of black, Latino, and female individuals in tech companies. She suggests that this trend may have roots in the public discourse around affirmative action, particularly following the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which justified the consideration of race in admissions for the educational benefits of diversity rather than to rectify past discrimination.

Williams implies that affirmative action should not be diluted to the point where it no longer serves to actively correct imbalances in representation based on race and gender. She stresses that diversity should encompass cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability, and especially gender and racial differences. Williams advocates for a more traditional understanding of diversity that includes identity diversity, which she sees as critical for creating truly inclusive environments in the tech industry. Her perspective suggests a commitment to the original intentions of affirmative action, which are to promote equality and representation for historically marginalized groups."	0.04282	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Ibram X. Kendi, discusses the issue of denial in the context of racism and suggests that denying racism includes resisting policies like affirmative action. While the text does not directly focus on affirmative action, Kendi's argument against denial and for the acknowledgment of systemic racism suggests that he views affirmative action as a necessary measure to address racial inequalities. Therefore, it can be inferred that Kendi is likely in favor of affirmative action as it aligns with his broader perspective on confronting and remedying racial injustice.	"Summary:
The text discusses the pervasive issue of denial in the context of American racism, particularly in light of comments attributed to President Trump that disparaged African countries. The author, Ibram X. Kendi, argues that denial is a common defense mechanism used to maintain a sense of superiority and to avoid confronting the ugliness of racism. Kendi highlights that denial is not unique to any political party or ideology in America, and that it has been a part of the nation's history, with past presidents also exhibiting racist behaviors and policies. He points out that this denial perpetuates racism and is evident in various phrases used to avoid acknowledging racist attitudes. Kendi emphasizes that being a racist is about actions and words, not a fixed identity, and that the antiracist approach involves confession and acknowledgment rather than denial.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not directly address affirmative action in detail, the author does discuss the denial of racism in the context of resisting policies such as affirmative action. Kendi suggests that part of the denial involves framing policies designed to address racial inequalities, such as affirmative action, as undeserved or as reverse discrimination. This indicates that the author views affirmative action as a necessary response to systemic racism and that opposition to such policies can be a form of denial about the realities of racial inequality. Kendi's perspective is that acknowledging and confronting racism directly, rather than denying its existence or impact, is crucial for progress towards racial justice, which would imply support for affirmative action as a tool to combat systemic inequities."	0.03365	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	1
	None	The author of the text does not directly express a stance on affirmative action. The text summary provided focuses on the dynamics of the gun control debate in the United States and does not offer sufficient information to categorize the author's view on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of it being a socially sensitive issue that can impact one's career if opposed, which indicates the author's awareness of its controversial nature but does not reveal their personal position on the matter.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the dynamics of gun control debate in the United States, initially presuming that while public support for moderate gun restrictions is strong, legislative action is weak due to Republican control of most legislatures and the influence of the NRA. The author initially believed that depolarizing the issue and respecting gun owners' perspectives could lead to progress, but observes that the opposite has happened, with left-wing groups polarizing the debate further. Despite initial legislative setbacks for gun control advocates, the author acknowledges a broader cultural shift that may delegitimize gun rights supporters. The author notes that conservatives have marginalized themselves by aligning with Trump, and progressives are effectively silencing dissent, potentially stigmatizing gun ownership. The author cautions progressives that winning cultural battles through intimidation rather than persuasion can lead to illiberalism and a political backlash.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly address their personal stance on affirmative action in the provided text. However, the author does mention that opposition to affirmative action is among the ideas that can end one's career, indicating that this viewpoint is becoming socially unacceptable in certain circles. This suggests that the author is aware of the shifting cultural norms regarding affirmative action and how it is increasingly seen as a litmus test for social acceptability in some elite or progressive environments. The author's primary concern appears to be with the methods by which cultural and social battles are won, emphasizing the potential negative consequences of using cultural power to silence opposing views, rather than engaging in open and persuasive discourse."	0.02796	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	Richard Cohen expresses skepticism about affirmative action, particularly in the context of admissions to Stuyvesant High School. He is concerned that affirmative action would unfairly penalize Asian American students who have gained admission through merit and hard work. Cohen highlights the sacrifices of these often not wealthy families and implies that changing the admissions system to increase diversity would undermine their efforts and the meritocratic nature of the current system.	"Summary:
Richard Cohen discusses the debate over admission policies at Stuyvesant High School, an elite public school in New York City known for its high-achieving students, particularly Asian Americans. Mayor Bill de Blasio considers the underrepresentation of Hispanic and black students in such schools a ""monumental injustice"" and seeks to change the admission system, which is currently based solely on an entrance exam. Cohen draws a parallel between the white males in Trump's base who feel disadvantaged by liberal policies and the potential impact of de Blasio's proposed changes on Asian American students. He argues that many Asian American families at Stuyvesant are not wealthy and have earned their places through hard work and sacrifice. Cohen expresses skepticism about affirmative action in this context, suggesting that it would unfairly penalize Asian American students who have succeeded within the current system.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Richard Cohen, seems to hold a critical view of affirmative action, at least in the context of the situation at Stuyvesant High School. Cohen's tolerance for affirmative action is ""limited"" and he appears to question its fairness when it comes at the expense of students who have succeeded through merit, particularly those from poor Asian American families. He suggests that changing the admissions system to favor other racial or ethnic groups would deprive Asian American students of what they have earned. Cohen emphasizes the hard work and sacrifices made by these families to prepare their children for the entrance exam, implying that altering the system in the name of diversity would undermine a meritocratic process and the efforts of those who have played by the rules. Overall, Cohen's perspective is that affirmative action, in this case, would be unjust and detrimental to those who have achieved success through dedication and hard work, regardless of their socioeconomic status."	0.028489999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is framed within a strategic political context rather than a moral or ideological one. They suggest that Democrats should avoid focusing on affirmative action during the midterm campaigns because it is a polarizing social issue that does not carry broad public support. This suggests that the author is considering the political expediency of affirmative action in the context of elections, rather than expressing a personal stance for or against the policy itself. Therefore, the author is neutral on the issue of affirmative action in the sense that they do not evaluate its merits or faults but rather advise on its utility as a campaign issue.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece that discusses the strategy Democrats should adopt in response to President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee. The author outlines a three-step guide for Democrats to navigate the confirmation process effectively. The first step is to be realistic about the nominee's likely confirmation due to the Republican majority in the Senate. The second step encourages Democrats not to lose hope, drawing on insights from political scientist Theda Skocpol, who suggests that liberals should focus on grassroots movements and winning local elections, similar to what conservatives did in the past. The third step advises Democrats to focus on issues where they have public support, such as health insurance, taxation, and corporate power, rather than more polarizing social issues like abortion and affirmative action. The author emphasizes that the midterm elections are more critical than the Supreme Court battle and that Democrats should concentrate their efforts on winning them.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that while it is an issue that inspires liberal passion, it may not be strategically advantageous for Democrats to make it a central topic during the midterm campaign. The author suggests that affirmative action, along with other social issues, is not among the best issues for Democrats to focus on because they do not hold a decisive advantage in public opinion on these topics. Instead, the author believes that Democrats should prioritize issues that have broader public support and are more likely to win votes during the midterms. The author's stance is pragmatic and focused on political strategy rather than a moral or ideological evaluation of affirmative action as a policy."	0.02849	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author begins by acknowledging the positive aspects of Pete Wilson's career, including his affirmative-action hiring practices as mayor. However, the author criticizes Wilson's later actions to eliminate affirmative action, indicating a belief in the importance of such measures to address historical disadvantages faced by minorities. The criticism of Wilson's reversal on affirmative action suggests that the author views the policy as beneficial and necessary for promoting equality. The author's recognition of the role affirmative action played in helping minorities and the view that its elimination was damaging implies a supportive stance towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a satirical piece thanking former California Governor Pete Wilson for his service and actions throughout his political career. It begins by acknowledging his years of public service in various roles, including assemblyman, mayor, U.S. senator, and governor. The author appreciates Wilson's moderate approach and his efforts during his mayoral term to protect wetlands and implement affirmative-action hiring practices. However, the piece also criticizes Wilson for his later actions, such as deregulating California's electricity market, signing three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted undocumented immigrants.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author initially commends Wilson for implementing affirmative-action hiring practices as mayor of San Diego, recognizing the importance of such measures to address historical disadvantages faced by minorities. However, the author later criticizes Wilson for his efforts to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California and beyond, viewing it as a betrayal of his earlier stance. The author implies that affirmative action played a critical role in helping minorities enter the middle class and that Wilson's reversal on the issue was damaging and radicalized college students. The tone suggests that the author supports affirmative action as a means to rectify past injustices and promote equality."	0.02645	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt	1
	None	Erwin Chemerinsky does not explicitly express his personal views on affirmative action in the provided summary. His discussion is centered on the interpretative role of Supreme Court justices and how their personal ideologies influence their rulings on various constitutional issues, including affirmative action. He uses affirmative action as an example to illustrate the broader point that justices make value choices, rather than to advocate for or against affirmative action policies. Because the author does not specifically advocate for or against affirmative action, and his primary focus is on judicial interpretation, it is not possible to categorize his stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, a distinguished professor of law, criticizes the analogy used by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who described justices as ""umpires,"" suggesting they are neutral arbiters without personal or policy preferences influencing their decisions. Chemerinsky argues that this is misleading because the interpretation of the Constitution's broad and open-ended language inherently involves justices' ideologies and life experiences. He provides examples of how the Supreme Court's decisions on the First and Second Amendments, as well as other constitutional rights, are influenced by the justices' values and beliefs, not just by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. Chemerinsky emphasizes that the contentious nature of Supreme Court nominee confirmations reflects the public's understanding that justices are not merely umpires but rather make significant value choices in their rulings.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Erwin Chemerinsky does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action within the provided text. However, he does mention it as an example of how the Supreme Court must determine whether a government interest is ""compelling,"" ""important,"" or ""legitimate,"" which involves making a value choice. In the context of affirmative action in college admissions, the court has to decide if diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. This example is used to illustrate his broader argument that justices' decisions are influenced by their own ideologies and cannot be purely objective or derived solely from the Constitution's text. The author's focus is more on the interpretative role of the justices rather than on affirmative action itself."	0.02735	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed indirectly through their discussion of Elizabeth Wydra's concerns about Brett Kavanaugh's stance on the issue. The author presents Wydra's point of view that Kavanaugh's past writings and language used to describe affirmative action suggest a negative view of these policies. By highlighting the contrast between Kavanaugh's public statements and his private memos, the author suggests skepticism about Kavanaugh's support for policies addressing systemic racism. The author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action, but by focusing on the criticism of Kavanaugh's apparent position, they appear to align with the perspective that affirmative action is necessary to address racial inequalities. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they underscore the importance of such policies and the concerns of their advocates.	"Summary:
The Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was highly contentious, marked by partisan division and accusations of political grandstanding. Democrats attempted to halt the proceedings, citing withheld documents, while Republicans accused them of theatrics. Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican votes. The hearing was noted for its lack of substantive answers from the nominee, continuing a trend of nominees revealing less about their views. The confirmation process has become increasingly partisan over the years, with a decline in bipartisan support for nominees.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author highlights the concerns raised by Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, regarding Kavanaugh's perspective on affirmative action. Wydra points to a stark contrast between Kavanaugh's public commendation of the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling and his private White House memos that criticize affirmative action policies using terms like ""naked racial set-aside"" and ""racial spoils system."" These terms suggest Kavanaugh views affirmative action as an unfair distribution of advantages based on race, rather than a means to address systemic racism. The author conveys a perspective that Kavanaugh's stance on affirmative action is seen as troubling by advocates for such policies, who believe they are necessary to redress entrenched racial inequalities."	0.03387	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt	1
	None	The provided text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action as it relates to domestic policy or issues such as race, gender, or employment. Instead, the text discusses the right to asylum and immigration policies. The author's views on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided, as it does not address the typical contexts in which affirmative action is debated (e.g., college admissions, workplace diversity). The author's stance on human rights and asylum may suggest a general inclination towards supporting policies that aim to redress inequalities or provide protection to vulnerable groups, but this does not directly translate to a clear stance on affirmative action as it is commonly understood.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor address Hillary Clinton's comments warning Europe about the consequences of maintaining open-door policies for refugees and migrants. Pierre Bertrand, a former director at the UNHCR, criticizes Clinton for endorsing policies that contradict her image as a human rights advocate and reminds readers of the right to asylum enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Lorna Salzman praises Clinton for recognizing how uncontrolled migration has fueled right-wing populism in Europe, blaming the European left for not acknowledging cultural differences between Europeans and refugees. Jane Carey argues that focusing on immigration as the cause of the far-right's rise is misplaced and that the root causes, such as Western interference in other regions and climate change, must be addressed to resolve the immigration crisis.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Pierre Bertrand, expresses a positive view towards affirmative action, specifically in the context of Angela Merkel's policies towards Syrian refugees in Germany. He commends Merkel for her actions and criticizes Clinton for advocating for policies that go against the spirit of affirmative action in the name of political gain. Bertrand highlights the importance of upholding the principles of human rights and the right to seek asylum, suggesting that these should guide affirmative actions towards refugees and migrants."	0.022099999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical approach to affirmative action, with emphasis on the ineffectiveness and potential negative consequences of such policies, indicates a stance that is not supportive of affirmative action. By highlighting that these policies benefit the already well-off within targeted groups and may exacerbate ethnic tensions, the author suggests that affirmative action is not the right solution for improving socioeconomic disparities. The comparison with Singapore and the University of California system further underscores the author's skepticism about the necessity and productivity of affirmative action. Therefore, the author appears to be somewhat against or strongly against affirmative action, but without additional context, it is difficult to ascertain the intensity of the opposition.	"Summary:
The text discusses the protests in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where around 55,000 people gathered to support race-based policies favoring the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These affirmative action policies in Malaysia, which began in the 1950s, were meant to expire in 1991 but have been extended for political reasons. The author compares the situation in Malaysia to affirmative action debates in the United States, citing examples of racial tensions in educational institutions and questioning the effectiveness of such policies. The author points out that in both countries, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action are often already well-off and that the policies may not be as effective as claimed in improving the socioeconomic status of the targeted groups.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action policies, both in Malaysia and the United States. The perspective is that these policies may not effectively assist the underprivileged and instead tend to benefit those who are already well-off within the targeted groups. The author suggests that affirmative action can exacerbate ethnic tensions and may not be necessary or productive in the long term. The text points to examples where the absence of affirmative action, like in Singapore, has not prevented the economic advancement of the Malays, and where the end of race-based admissions in the University of California system led to better outcomes for black students. The author's view is that affirmative action policies are often politically motivated, may not achieve their intended goals, and could have unintended negative consequences."	0.02716	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author presents a nuanced view of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's stance on affirmative action. Moynihan supported affirmative action and other policies aimed at improving the conditions of the black family, indicating a favorable view towards these measures. However, the author also notes Moynihan's complex evolution and eventual skepticism regarding social policy effectiveness, which suggests that while Moynihan was initially in favor, his support may have become more cautious over time. The author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action but instead focuses on Moynihan's perspective and the complexities therein.	"Summary:
The text is an in-depth profile of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a long-serving U.S. Senator known for his intellectual prowess and unique contributions to American politics. Moynihan is portrayed as a complex figure, respected for his ideas but criticized for his lack of legislative accomplishments and effectiveness in office. The author, Jacob Weisberg, provides a detailed account of Moynihan's career, from his early days in the Kennedy administration to his final years in the Senate. The profile touches on Moynihan's personal life, his political shifts, and his role in various administrations, as well as his perspectives on social policy, his relationship with the Clinton administration, and his eventual disillusionment with the state of the Senate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author discusses Moynihan's involvement with affirmative action, particularly in relation to his controversial 1965 report on the black family, which is sometimes referred to as the Moynihan Report. Moynihan supported affirmative action as part of a range of policies aimed at enhancing ""the stability and resources of the Negro American family,"" including jobs programs, housing programs, and birth control assistance. However, the author suggests that Moynihan's report was not well-received by many civil rights leaders at the time because it was perceived as blaming the victim and potentially providing fodder for racists. Despite these criticisms, Moynihan is credited with having foresight into the issues facing the black community, particularly the impact of family breakup on achieving racial equality.

The author narrates Moynihan's journey as a political figure who often found himself at odds with both the liberal left and conservative right. Moynihan's ideas about affirmative action and social policy were complex and evolved over time. He was initially a proponent of government intervention to address racial inequalities, but his experiences with the backlash against his report and the perceived failures of the Great Society programs led him to become more skeptical about the effectiveness of social policy. Despite this skepticism, Moynihan continued to engage with issues of race and social policy throughout his career, though he often faced criticism from various political factions for his views."	0.11974	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author discusses the affirmative action debate in the context of the college admissions scandal without explicitly taking a side. They acknowledge the arguments of both opponents and proponents, suggesting that wealth plays a significant role in college admissions. The author's focus is on the complexities of the issue, including the intersections of class and race, and the contentious nature of the conversation following the scandal. However, there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as they neither advocate for nor against it directly.	"Summary:
The text touches upon various instances where President Trump and other political figures have been involved in amplifying divisive rhetoric. Trump is criticized for Islamophobic remarks and for his negative comments about the late Senator John McCain. The college admissions scandal has reignited debate over affirmative action, with opponents arguing that elite colleges cannot be trusted to fairly assess students and proponents highlighting that wealth, more than race, influences college admissions. Senator Amy Klobuchar criticizes Trump for amplifying racial and religious hatred, which is echoed by Chris Wallace of Fox News in the context of the Christchurch shooting. The text also mentions an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker's controversial reaction to being egged after making inflammatory comments about Muslim immigration. Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege is contrasted with his emphasis on his unique perspective as a candidate from the U.S./Mexico border, which the author suggests overlooks other candidates with similar backgrounds.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of the affirmative action debate, especially in light of the college admissions scandal. The scandal has provided ammunition for those who oppose affirmative action, as they argue that the admissions process is already biased and cannot be trusted. However, defenders of affirmative action counter that the real issue is the advantage wealth confers in gaining admission to elite institutions, rather than race-based admissions policies. The author seems to suggest that the scandal has brought to the forefront the complexities and intersections of class and race in college admissions, without explicitly taking a side in the affirmative action debate. The perspective presented is that the scandal has amplified existing issues and has made the conversation around affirmative action more contentious."	0.022850000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, does not explicitly state her position on affirmative action within the summary provided. However, she does discuss the negative perceptions and challenges she faces as an African-American woman in academia, which are often influenced by anti-affirmative action sentiment. While she acknowledges the controversy and the adverse effects of the policy's delegitimization on qualified individuals from minority backgrounds, she does not directly express whether she is in favor of or against affirmative action. Instead, she emphasizes her qualifications and the importance of being recognized for her merit and expertise. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined with certainty from the given summary.	"Summary:
In the article, Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, discusses the importance of titles in the academic world and her insistence on being addressed as ""Dr. Berry"" in the classroom. She notes that titles are often used inconsistently in academia, with some of her white male colleagues preferring informal monikers. However, as a minority in a predominantly white and male field, she feels she cannot afford such informality. Berry shares her experiences of students questioning her qualifications and legitimacy, often influenced by anti-affirmative action sentiment. She faces challenges such as having her lectures critiqued and her dialect questioned, which she believes her white male colleagues do not endure. Despite the supposed progressiveness of higher education, Berry highlights the underrepresentation of African-American women in engineering academia. She became a professor to change the face of engineering and show that it can be diverse, and by insisting on her title, she aims to set an example for other female and black students.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, expresses a critical view of how affirmative action is perceived and its impact on individuals like herself. She acknowledges that there is a widespread presumption among some students that as an African-American female, she may be less qualified or was hired to fulfill a diversity quota. Berry indicates that the reputation of affirmative action has been tarnished by its opponents, to the point where it negatively affects the perception of those who might have benefited from it, whether or not they actually did. She seems to understand the controversy surrounding affirmative action but also points out the adverse effects of the policy's delegitimization on qualified individuals from minority backgrounds. Despite not directly advocating for or against affirmative action, Berry's emphasis on her qualifications and the need to assert her professional title suggests that she seeks recognition based on her merit and expertise, rather than any policy of preferential treatment."	0.03174	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed through the relay of The Washington Post's viewpoint, which is supportive. The affirmative action policy at the University of Texas at Austin is described as a 'prime example' and 'conscientiously designed,' indicating a positive stance towards such policies. This language suggests that the author, or at least The Washington Post, views affirmative action as a necessary measure to achieve diversity in higher education. The emphasis on the policy being carefully crafted to complement race-neutral measures implies a belief in the judicious implementation of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The provided text discusses various editorial perspectives on different issues from around the world. The New York Times editorial supports a bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that aims to end the bulk collection of American telephone records, increase transparency in intelligence agencies, and establish a privacy rights panel. The Washington Post backs the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin’s affirmative action policy in admissions. The Boston Globe addresses the Massachusetts State Legislature's response to the Supreme Court's objections to the state's buffer-zone law, which restricted protests near abortion clinics. The Guardian praises Janet Yellen, Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, for her focus on increasing wages in addition to reducing unemployment. The Globe and Mail reports on the progress being made against colony collapse disorder among honeybees, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. Finally, The Korea Herald criticizes Japan's rejection of the U.N. Committee on Human Rights' call for investigation and apology regarding wartime sex slavery, highlighting the tension this causes with other Asian countries.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author relays The Washington Post's viewpoint, which is supportive of affirmative action policies, specifically the one at the University of Texas at Austin. The policy is described as a ""prime example"" of the type that should pass judicial scrutiny, suggesting that the author (or The Washington Post) views affirmative action as a necessary and judicious approach to achieving diversity in higher education. The editorial underscores the University of Texas at Austin's policy as ""conscientiously designed,"" implying that it is a thoughtful and careful effort to complement the race-neutral top 10 percent program and to achieve a diverse student body. This perspective indicates an approval of affirmative action when it is implemented in a considered and targeted manner."	0.029500000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The collective stance of the authors is in support of affirmative action. They each address and refute the 'mismatch' theory, which posits that affirmative action can be detrimental to minority students by placing them in educational settings for which they are not prepared. Kidder provides empirical evidence against the mismatch theory and underscores the benefits of affirmative action. Jordan views affirmative action as a necessary response to societal inequalities and systemic issues in education. McAlevey argues for the maintenance or expansion of affirmative action as a countermeasure to pervasive racism until a better solution is implemented. Jelks critiques the mismatch theory by pointing to the success of supportive environments, such as historically black colleges, in fostering minority student achievement. Their arguments collectively suggest that affirmative action is an important tool to combat systemic disadvantages and should be sustained until true equality is realized.	"Summary:

The letters to the editor discuss the concept of ""mismatch"" in affirmative action policies, which suggests that affirmative action can harm minority students by placing them in schools where they may not be academically prepared. William Kidder argues against the mismatch theory, citing flaws in the foundational study by Richard H. Sander and pointing to evidence that suggests minority students benefit from attending more selective universities. Rosiland Jordan emphasizes the necessity of affirmative action given societal inequalities, arguing that any stigma against minority students is a result of systemic issues in education and not affirmative action itself. Jane McAlevey suggests that affirmative action should be maintained or even expanded until a better solution to racism is found and proven effective. Randal Maurice Jelks critiques the assumptions of mismatch theory, highlighting the role of institutional climate and the success of historically black colleges in supporting black students' achievements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

The authors collectively support affirmative action, though they approach it from different angles. They challenge the mismatch theory and argue that affirmative action remains necessary due to ongoing inequalities and systemic racism in education and society at large.

- William Kidder focuses on the empirical evidence that discredits the mismatch theory and supports the benefits of affirmative action for minority students at selective universities.
  
- Rosiland Jordan defends affirmative action as essential until broader societal reforms ensure equal opportunities and support for all students, regardless of race.
  
- Jane McAlevey frames affirmative action as a necessary measure in the face of America's deep-seated racism and calls for its expansion until an effective alternative is found.
  
- Randal Maurice Jelks criticizes the foundations of the mismatch theory, emphasizing the importance of supportive institutional environments and the success of historically black colleges, which suggests that the issue is not with the students' abilities but rather with the support systems in place at educational institutions.

Overall, the authors view affirmative action as a tool to combat systemic disadvantages faced by minority students and reject the notion that it is harmful to the beneficiaries. They advocate for the continued use of affirmative action until equality in education and society is truly achieved."	0.03081	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The provided summary does not directly address the author's stance on affirmative action. The focus of the text is on President Obama's negotiation tactics, President Nixon's approach to governance, and the shift in political allegiances due to changes in the GOP. While affirmative action is mentioned positively in the context of Nixon's policies, there is not enough information to determine the author's personal stance on the issue. The mention of affirmative action seems to serve the larger narrative of contrasting past and present political strategies and ideologies rather than expressing a clear position on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on President Obama's negotiation tactics during the debt ceiling agreement, contrasted with the more aggressive and unpredictable approach of former President Nixon. A Hollywood dealmaker criticizes Obama for not using the 14th Amendment as a bargaining chip and for being transparently reasonable rather than adopting Nixon's ""Madman Theory."" The author then reflects on Nixon's presidency, highlighting his surprisingly liberal policies, such as the establishment of the EPA and OSHA, support for civil rights, and social welfare initiatives. The author suggests that Nixon's approach to governance was more progressive than any president that followed, despite his tarnished reputation. The commentary concludes with an anecdote about the author's mother, who switched political allegiance due to the extreme rightward shift of the GOP, indicating that even Nixon might have been shocked by the party's current state.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action positively, indicating that Nixon, commonly perceived as a conservative figure, actually began affirmative action in federal hiring. This suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a policy that transcends traditional party lines and is a significant step towards civil rights and equality. The author's mention of Nixon's support for affirmative action is part of a broader argument that Nixon's policies were more liberal and progressive than he is often given credit for, especially in the context of today's political climate."	0.027129999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the Federalist Society and its conservative stances, including opposition to affirmative action, but the author's personal view on the matter is not directly expressed. The summary discusses the author's concern over the potential far-right influence on the courts and mentions the Federalist Society's opposition to affirmative action as part of their conservative agenda. However, without a clear statement from the author regarding their own stance on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize their position.	"Summary:
Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor at the University of Texas, expressed frustration at the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala, despite the organization's influence and success in shaping legal policy and appointing judges under the Bush administration. The event celebrated conservative victories and featured prominent government officials, but also highlighted the discontent of some attendees with current policies, such as antitrust enforcement and state lawsuits against tobacco companies. The author observed a preoccupation with past liberal adversaries and noted Kenneth Starr's speech criticizing liberals for being result-oriented, although Starr himself praised conservative judicial activism. The author concludes that vigilance is needed to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts and to protect mainstream legal principles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author reflects on past interactions with members of the Federalist Society, recalling their opposition to affirmative action and the New Deal during their time on the Harvard Law Review. The author's recounting of this memory indicates that the Federalist Society and its members have long held conservative views, including a critical stance on affirmative action. The author does not directly express their own opinion on affirmative action within the text provided, but the mention of it in the context of the Federalist Society's conservative legal policies implies that the author may view the organization's perspective on affirmative action as part of a broader conservative agenda that they approach with skepticism."	0.02737	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	Michael Teachout's letter does not directly address his personal stance on affirmative action. He mentions General Colin L. Powell's support for affirmative action only to demonstrate that President-elect Bush's cabinet includes members with diverse viewpoints. Teachout's focus is on the president's right to appoint cabinet members who align with his views for their specific roles, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, Teachout's stance on affirmative action is not clearly indicated in the text provided.	"Summary:
Michael Teachout, in his letter to the editor, responds to criticism of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet choices, as highlighted in the editorial ""More Conservatives From Mr. Bush."" Teachout challenges the expectation for ideological diversity within the cabinet, noting that the editorial board has not similarly advocated for President Clinton to appoint cabinet members with conservative views on issues like abortion rights. He points out that Bush's cabinet members, such as General Colin L. Powell and Governor Christie Whitman, do have differing opinions from Bush on certain issues like affirmative action and abortion, respectively. However, they align with Bush's views for the roles they have been appointed to. Teachout emphasizes the balance of power provided by the three branches of government and questions the practicality of a president appointing cabinet members with whom they cannot work effectively.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Michael Teachout, does not directly express his personal view on affirmative action. Instead, he mentions General Colin L. Powell's stance on the issue as an example of ideological diversity within President-elect Bush's cabinet. Powell's support for affirmative action is used to illustrate that, despite the criticism, Bush's cabinet selections do include individuals with different viewpoints. Teachout's main argument is centered on the importance of appointing cabinet members whose beliefs align with the president's for their designated positions, rather than focusing on the presence of ideological diversity for its own sake."	0.018279999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly address or express a stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. The text focuses on the political and judicial processes, particularly the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White's nomination and Senator Ashcroft's actions. Affirmative action is mentioned only in passing and is not the subject of the author's critique. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The author criticizes the 106th Congress for its cynicism and hypocrisy, highlighting various actions that demonstrate this perspective. Examples include the appointment of members who oppose a bill on managed-care health plans, the passing of a bill that increases profits for student loan companies, and the imposition of federal will over state laws. The author is particularly appalled by the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White's nomination to a federal judgeship, based on misleading accusations by Senator John Ashcroft that White was ""pro-criminal"" and biased against the death penalty. The author refutes these claims by pointing out White's actual record on upholding death sentences and the support he received from law enforcement groups. The author suggests that the real motive behind Ashcroft's opposition was to appear tough on crime for re-election purposes and criticizes other Republicans for supporting Ashcroft's stance. The author dismisses allegations of racism in the rejection of White, instead condemning the Senate for corrupting the confirmation process and unfairly maligning a qualified judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action in the text provided. However, the author does mention a case where Judge Earl Blackwell, who opposed affirmative action, was involved in a trial. In this context, affirmative action is referenced as part of a broader discussion about the political and judicial process, rather than as the primary subject of the author's critique. The author's focus is more on the manipulation of the confirmation process and the mischaracterization of Justice White's record by Senator Ashcroft and other Republicans."	0.02583	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports the concept of affirmative action, acknowledging the importance of racial diversity in the workplace. They view the goal as honorable but criticize the execution in the Piscataway case, indicating a nuanced position that supports the principle but not all applications of it. Furthermore, the author's agreement with the decision to settle to avoid a potentially damaging Supreme Court ruling shows a protective stance towards affirmative action policies in general. The suggestion to find a more suitable case to address the broader legal questions indicates that the author believes in the legitimacy of affirmative action but wants it to be upheld and scrutinized under the best possible circumstances.	"Summary:
The Piscataway, New Jersey, school board settled a lawsuit with Sharon Taxman, a white teacher who was laid off in 1989 in favor of a black teacher due to affirmative action considerations. The settlement was reached to avoid a potential Supreme Court ruling that civil rights groups feared could have undermined affirmative action laws nationwide. Taxman was awarded $433,500 for back pay and legal fees. The case had been scheduled for the Supreme Court, but there was concern that the Court might not only rule against the specific race-based decision but also prohibit the use of racial criteria in employment more broadly. The case was seen as a poor choice for resolving broader legal questions about the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and affirmative action because of its unique circumstances—the two teachers involved had identical seniority and similar qualifications.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a concept, viewing the goal of maintaining racial diversity in the workplace as honorable. However, the author criticizes the specific implementation in the Piscataway case as ""clumsy,"" suggesting that while the intentions were good, the execution was flawed. The author also seems to agree with the decision to settle the case rather than risk a Supreme Court decision that could have had far-reaching negative consequences for affirmative action programs. The author implies that a more suitable case should be used to address the legality of considering race in employment decisions under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, rather than the Piscataway case, which had atypical characteristics that made it a poor standard-bearer for the issue."	0.021670000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action. While they acknowledge that the specific application in the Piscataway case may not have been appropriate, they still support the use of affirmative action in general. The author believes that affirmative action serves important public goals and has intrinsic value in creating a diverse workforce and judiciary. The support is not without reservation, as they emphasize the need for affirmative action to be judiciously applied and not used in an unjustified manner. However, the overall tone and arguments presented suggest that the author sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to combat discrimination and promote diversity, even though they recognize the need for careful implementation.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton Administration's changed stance on a Supreme Court case involving affirmative action, specifically regarding a situation in Piscataway, N.J., where a school board laid off a white teacher to maintain racial diversity by keeping an equally qualified black teacher. The Administration had initially supported the school board but later acknowledged that the board's action violated the civil rights of the white teacher. The Supreme Court has previously stated that racial preferences in government decisions are constitutional only to remedy past discrimination or to achieve a ""compelling"" public goal in a ""narrowly tailored"" manner. The Administration's brief suggests that while the Piscataway case may not meet these criteria, there are still valid uses for affirmative action. The text also touches on the broader public debate and legal challenges to affirmative action, mentioning California's ban and a Federal appeals court ruling against the use of race in admissions at the University of Texas Law School.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive but nuanced. They recognize the complexity of the issue and the need for affirmative action to be applied judiciously. The author argues that while the specific application of affirmative action in the Piscataway case may not be justified, there are valid and compelling reasons to consider race in public hiring and education. They suggest that affirmative action can serve important public goals, such as promoting effective law enforcement in diverse communities or fostering racial diversity within educational faculties to teach students about cross-racial cooperation.

The author also warns against adopting an absolutist color-blind approach, which they believe would undermine efforts to prevent racial discrimination. They highlight the importance of recruitment efforts targeting minority candidates as necessary measures to combat discrimination, despite these efforts involving race-based distinctions. The author advocates for the continued use of affirmative action, not only to rectify past discrimination but also to achieve a diverse workforce and judiciary, which they view as having intrinsic value. They hope that the Supreme Court will recognize the importance of maintaining some degree of affirmative action in its ruling on the Piscataway case."	0.03207	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	Timothy R. Cahn appears to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action. While he supports the use of affirmative action, he critiques the argument made by Matsuda and Lawrence, suggesting that their rationale is not the strongest case for it. Cahn's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is necessary to create a university demographic that mirrors society's racial diversity, rather than solely to combat overt discrimination. His stance indicates that he believes in the value of affirmative action but also sees room for refining its justification and possibly its implementation.	"Summary:
In a letter to the editor, Timothy R. Cahn addresses an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence concerning affirmative action. Cahn argues that Matsuda and Lawrence have not made the strongest case for maintaining affirmative action. He suggests that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admission based on race, the lack of proportionate racial representation in universities must be due to factors unrelated to merit. Cahn believes affirmative action is necessary, not primarily to address overt discrimination (as Matsuda and Lawrence propose), but to correct an admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect the racial diversity of society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Timothy R. Cahn, supports affirmative action but offers a different rationale than the one presented by Matsuda and Lawrence. While Matsuda and Lawrence argue for affirmative action as a means to redress overt discrimination, Cahn believes the primary reason for its necessity is to adjust an admissions system that fails to produce a student body representative of society's racial demographics. Cahn implies that affirmative action should be used to ensure that universities provide equal opportunities and outcomes that are more reflective of the racial composition of the wider community, beyond just countering direct discrimination."	0.01695	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, Evan Edwards, is critical of affirmative action, arguing that opposition to such policies by the Republican Party does not signify an anti-women stance. He defends the party's position on affirmative action, suggesting that it is a principled stance rather than a discriminatory one. Edwards does not express support for affirmative action; instead, he implies that it is not essential for gender equality and that the party's history of appointing women to high positions is evidence of its commitment to women without the need for affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor is a response to Frank Rich's column discussing Tanya Melich, a former Republican who left the party. The author, Evan Edwards, labels Melich as a ""fink,"" arguing that the Republican Party in Manhattan is known for its liberal to ultra-liberal stance, unlike the ultra-right elements in other regions. Edwards references the formation of the New York State Conservative Party as an alternative to liberal Republicans. He also points out the inclusion of AIDS activist Mary Fisher at the 1992 Republican convention and contrasts it with the Democrats' exclusion of Gov. Robert P. Casey's anti-abortion stance at their convention. Edwards highlights the Republican Party's history of appointing women to high positions, including to the Supreme Court. He defends the party's position on affirmative action and welfare, asserting that being against these policies does not equate to being anti-women. Edwards concludes by suggesting that Melich is more aligned with the Democratic Party, particularly with figures like Ruth Messinger.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Evan Edwards, takes a critical stance on affirmative action. He believes that the Republican Party's opposition to affirmative action does not make it anti-women. Edwards suggests that the party's stance on affirmative action is part of its core beliefs and implies that the party should not deviate from these beliefs to accommodate a ""big-tent"" idea if it means compromising on its principles. His perspective is that affirmative action is not a necessary policy for the Republican Party to support in order to be inclusive of women or to demonstrate a commitment to gender equality."	0.021359999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's discussion of the need for reparations and the acknowledgment of ongoing racial injustices, such as housing discrimination, police violence, wage gaps, and healthcare inequities, indicates a belief in the importance of addressing systemic discrimination and the legacy of slavery. The author's criticism of those who dismiss the need for affirmative action, and the desire for national acknowledgment and redress for the harm caused by slavery and ongoing racism, suggests a strong conviction that affirmative action is necessary to combat these enduring effects. The author's perspective aligns with a proactive stance in favor of affirmative action as part of a broader effort to correct historical injustices and support marginalized groups.	"Summary:
The text discusses a House Judiciary panel hearing on H.R. 40, a bill proposing to study reparations for slavery in the U.S., coinciding with Juneteenth. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposes reparations, arguing that civil rights legislation and the election of Barack Obama have addressed the legacy of slavery. The author counters this view, pointing to ongoing racial injustices, such as housing discrimination, police violence, wage gaps, healthcare inequities, and the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The author argues that the impact of slavery persists and that reparations are necessary to address the systemic damage caused by slavery and its aftermath. The author expresses a desire to witness a genuine national acknowledgment and redress for the harm caused by slavery and ongoing racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it remains a necessary tool to combat the enduring effects of racism and inequality. The author is critical of those who believe affirmative action is no longer needed, and points to the continued presence of wage gaps, workplace inequality, and healthcare inequities as evidence of systemic discrimination that needs to be addressed. The author's stance is that affirmative action is part of a broader effort to correct historical injustices and provide support to those who have been marginalized. The author's mention of witnessing ""the shrugging of shoulders"" and ""eye rolls"" implies frustration with the lack of understanding or acknowledgment of the importance of affirmative action by some segments of society."	0.02749	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of Hawaii's labor movement and its practice of ensuring equal representation of ethnic groups in union leadership indicates a recognition of the value of deliberate measures to promote racial equality. Although the author does not explicitly endorse or oppose affirmative action, the positive view of Hawaii's historical approach to racial harmony, which shares similarities with affirmative action goals, suggests a perspective that is at least somewhat in favor of such measures. The author appreciates the outcomes of these efforts, which align with the principles of affirmative action, even if the term 'affirmative action' is not directly used.	"Summary:
The text is an exploration of race and identity through the lens of Kristin Pauker's experiences as a mixed-race individual in both Hawaii and Dartmouth. Dr. Pauker, a psychology professor, conducts research on how children perceive race and whether their views are essentialist, i.e., seeing race as a permanent, inherent quality. Her studies reveal that children in Hawaii, unlike their Boston counterparts, do not hold essentialist views of race. The author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, also of mixed heritage, discusses how Hawaii's history of diverse ethnicities and cultures, as well as its labor movement's emphasis on interracial unity, has fostered a more fluid understanding of race. He suggests that the ""aloha spirit"" and the recognition of Hawaii as an ecological island may offer insights into overcoming racial divisions by acknowledging interdependence and the finite nature of resources.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action, he delves into the concept of racial harmony and the impact of historical and cultural factors on race relations. The author references Hawaii's postwar labor movement, which practiced a form of ""proto affirmative action"" by ensuring equal representation of all ethnic groups in union leadership. This deliberate restructuring aimed to dismantle racial barriers and promote opportunity for all, which the author suggests had a positive, long-lasting effect on Hawaiian society. The perspective presented is that deliberate efforts to address racial inequality and foster interracial cooperation can lead to a more inclusive and equitable society, which aligns with the broader goals of affirmative action policies."	0.08603000000000001	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	Harry Piotrowski's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed through a critical lens, highlighting the irony and perceived hypocrisy in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia based on ethnic background while both were opponents of affirmative action. Piotrowski's commentary suggests a belief that actions taken by these figures contradict their public stance against affirmative action. The author does not explicitly state support or opposition to affirmative action but focuses on pointing out the inconsistency between the philosophy of meritocracy and the actual practices of those who publicly oppose affirmative action. Therefore, the stance is somewhat against affirmative action, as the author criticizes its application by those who are ostensibly against it.	"Summary:
The provided text includes three separate letters to the editor, each with a unique perspective on the selection of a Supreme Court justice and the concept of ""ordinary Americans.""

1. Robert B. Newlin from Arlington suggests that President Obama should nominate an ""ordinary person"" to the Supreme Court, someone who is a logical thinker and has a nonpolitical track record, such as a business executive, health-care professional, educator, or military leader.

2. Richard L. Sheffield from Columbia criticizes the use of the term ""ordinary"" when discussing American citizens, arguing that it implies inferiority and suggests using just ""Americans"" instead, hinting at a sense of condescension or noblesse oblige in the current discourse.

3. Harry Piotrowski from Crofton points out the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court based on ethnic background, given both Reagan's and Scalia's opposition to affirmative action, suggesting that Scalia believes he deserved his position regardless of such considerations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Harry Piotrowski, seems to view affirmative action as a contentious and hypocritical issue, particularly in the context of the GOP and Scalia's appointment. Piotrowski notes the irony in Reagan appointing Scalia because of his ""Italian extraction,"" while both men purportedly opposed affirmative action and believed in a merit-based society. The tone suggests that Piotrowski sees a contradiction between the public stance against affirmative action and the private actions that resemble it. Moreover, Piotrowski implies that Scalia's self-perception of deserving his position on the Supreme Court is at odds with the affirmative action-like reason behind his nomination, highlighting a perceived inconsistency in the application of merit-based principles."	0.02452	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The focus of the text is on the Supreme Court's decision on DACA and the role of Chief Justice John Roberts, rather than on affirmative action policies. While the author notes that the court upheld affirmative action in higher education in the 2002-2003 term, this reference is used to illustrate the court's alignment with societal expectations rather than to express a clear stance on affirmative action itself. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to accurately determine the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses a series of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case and the role of Chief Justice John Roberts. The case was decided by a 5 to 4 vote, with Roberts writing the majority opinion that blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate DACA. The decision was based on administrative law principles, stating that the administration's rationale for ending DACA was inadequate and thus ""arbitrary and capricious."" The text also reflects on the implications of this decision and others, suggesting that the Supreme Court is aligning with societal expectations and sending a message to the Trump administration about the limits of its power. The author contemplates the court's evolving stance on various issues and the potential impact of future decisions on topics like abortion, religion, and presidential powers.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from their reference to the 2002-2003 Supreme Court term, during which the court upheld affirmative action in higher education. The author seems to view affirmative action positively, as part of a series of decisions that aligned with social progress and public expectations. The mention of the court's decision to uphold affirmative action suggests that the author sees it as a significant and positive legal precedent, contributing to the court's role in facilitating societal change and protecting minority interests. Additionally, the author's broader reflection on the court's decisions implies a belief that the Supreme Court should not stand in the way of social change and should consider the broader implications of its rulings on society."	0.03513	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Jennifer Lee, clearly advocates for affirmative action, as evidenced by her arguments against the claims that it would impose racial quotas and her presentation of data to refute the notion that Proposition 209 benefitted Asian Americans in university admissions. Lee highlights the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies and emphasizes the need for affirmative action to combat systemic discrimination. She also notes the support among Asian American voters for affirmative action and urges the community to vote for ACA 5. This indicates that Lee is not just in favor, but strongly in favor of affirmative action, as she actively promotes it as a necessary measure for equality and combats misconceptions about its effects.	"Summary:
The text discusses the possibility of California voters restoring affirmative action through Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5), which would repeal Proposition 209. Proposition 209 banned the consideration of race, sex, or ethnicity in public sectors in 1996. Supporters of affirmative action view ACA 5 as a corrective measure for historical and systemic inequalities, while opponents argue it introduces discrimination based on race and gender. The text particularly addresses concerns from some Asian immigrant communities that affirmative action would negatively impact their children's university admissions by imposing quotas. The author counters this by stating that racial quotas have been unconstitutional since 1978 and presents evidence that Proposition 209 did not benefit Asian Americans in university admissions, professional advancement, or earnings. The author also highlights the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies in combating discrimination, as shown by the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The text notes that the majority of Asian American voters support affirmative action and emphasizes the importance of their vote in the upcoming ballot.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jennifer Lee, is a strong advocate for affirmative action. She argues that affirmative action is necessary to address systemic discrimination and promote equality in various domains, such as education, employment, and leadership positions. Lee refutes the claim that affirmative action would impose racial quotas, clarifying that such quotas are unconstitutional. She provides data to show that Proposition 209 did not improve admission rates for Asian Americans in the University of California system and points out the barriers to professional advancement and leadership roles that Asian Americans face. Lee also highlights the support for affirmative action among Asian American voters, particularly U.S.-born and third-generation or higher Asian Americans. She believes that race-neutral policies are ineffective and that affirmative action is crucial for creating a more equitable opportunity structure for all marginalized groups. Lee calls for the Asian American community to advocate for affirmative action and to demonstrate their support by voting for ACA 5."	0.030780000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical view of the Trump administration's stance on affirmative action, especially in the context of college admissions, suggests that they likely see affirmative action as an important element of civil rights enforcement. While the author does not explicitly state their position on affirmative action, their concern over the DOJ's direction under Trump and Barr, combined with the emphasis on the historical role of the DOJ in protecting civil rights, implies a favorable view of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text commemorates the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), highlighting its creation post-Civil War to replace private attorneys with professional staff under the Attorney General, and to enforce civil rights laws for African Americans. The author expresses concern over the DOJ's direction under the Trump administration and Attorney General William P. Barr, citing instances of perceived partisanship, interference, and a lack of commitment to civil rights enforcement. The piece acknowledges the inherent challenges of depoliticizing the DOJ due to its ties to elected officials and suggests that reducing the breadth of federal criminal law might mitigate the risk of abuse. The author calls for a return to the DOJ's original ethos of professionalism and impartiality, particularly in upholding civil rights, and sees the post-Watergate reforms as a positive precedent. The text ends by stating that the Trump administration has failed to uphold these values and that the responsibility will fall to the next president and attorney general.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the Trump administration's stance on affirmative action, particularly in the context of college admissions. They mention the DOJ's backing for lawsuits against affirmative action as a negative point, implying that the author may view affirmative action as a positive or necessary policy for ensuring civil rights. This stance is consistent with the author's broader concern for civil rights enforcement and the historical role of the DOJ in protecting those rights."	0.02274	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's discussion of systemic racism, the impact of Reagan's policies on race relations, and the criticism of Reagan's stance on affirmative action indicates a perspective that is critical of efforts to dismantle affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is an important tool for addressing racial inequality and that Reagan's opposition to it was part of a racially insensitive agenda. By connecting this opposition to broader racial issues and the legacy of inequality, the author seems to be advocating for the importance and necessity of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of systemic racism in America, highlighted by the murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on Black Americans. It criticizes President Donald Trump for using racism as a political strategy and draws parallels between Trump and former President Ronald Reagan. The author argues that Reagan, like Trump, used racially coded language and dog whistles to appeal to white voters, citing Reagan's opposition to civil rights legislation, his ""states' rights"" speech near the site of a notorious civil rights murder, and his use of the ""welfare queen"" stereotype. The text suggests that Reagan's policies contributed to deteriorating race relations and set the stage for Trump's rise. It also mentions Reagan's resistance to imposing sanctions on apartheid South Africa and his role in escalating the war on drugs, which disproportionately affected Black Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a target for Reagan's administration, which sought to abolish it under the pretense that it victimized white men through reverse discrimination. This stance is seen as part of Reagan's broader racially insensitive policies and actions. The author implies that Reagan's efforts to dismantle affirmative action were part of a larger agenda to roll back civil rights gains and cater to the fears and prejudices of white voters. The perspective presented suggests that Reagan's opposition to affirmative action was misguided and harmful, contributing to a legacy of racial inequality that has persisted in American society."	0.03021	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt	1
	None	The author, Melanye Price, does not directly address affirmative action as a policy in the summary provided. Instead, Price emphasizes the political power and agency of Black women in the Democratic Party and their role in Kamala Harris's selection as the vice-presidential candidate. The author's perspective is that Harris's nomination should not be attributed to affirmative action but rather acknowledged as the result of Black women's political mobilization, loyalty, and strategy. The discussion centers on the collective efforts and influence of Black women, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy.	"Summary:
This text discusses the significance of Senator Kamala Harris's selection as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, emphasizing the role of Black women in shaping this historic moment. The author argues that it would be incorrect to view Harris's nomination as merely a result of affirmative action or an isolated event. Instead, it is portrayed as the culmination of the political power and sophisticated strategy of Black women within the Democratic Party. Black women voters have shown remarkable turnout and loyalty to the Democratic Party, and have organized grassroots efforts to mobilize voters and elect Black female representatives. Organizations like Higher Heights for America, She The People, and Power Rising have been instrumental in encouraging Black women's political involvement and ensuring their voices are heard. The article also reflects on the historical struggle for voting rights and the intersectionality of Black women's advocacy. Harris's selection is seen as a collective victory for Black women and a step forward in their political journey, rather than a singular achievement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melanye Price, is critical of the potential mischaracterization of Kamala Harris's selection as a product of affirmative action. Price suggests that such a perspective undermines the extensive political work and influence of Black women in the Democratic Party. The author views Harris's nomination as a result of the political power and strategic efforts of Black women, rather than a tokenistic or affirmative action choice. Price highlights the collective labor, voter mobilization, and political sophistication of Black women as the driving forces behind Harris's selection and the broader political successes of Black female politicians. The author acknowledges the historical and current contributions of Black women to the Democratic Party and insists that their support is both earned and strategic, reflecting a deep understanding of how to leverage their political power for the benefit of their community."	0.02932	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's recounting of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's perspective on affirmative action indicates a respect for the policy's role in addressing systemic discrimination and a recognition of the historical context that necessitates such measures. The text highlights Ginsburg's nuanced and informed approach to the issue, which the author appears to share. There is no explicit statement of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, but the admiration for Ginsburg's method of incorporating historical context and systemic discrimination into legal analyses suggests a positive view of affirmative action's role in promoting equality. The author's reflection on how Ginsburg's mentorship shaped their legal career further implies that the author values Ginsburg's approach to civil rights, which includes affirmative action as a tool to combat systemic inequality.	"Summary:
The author recounts attending a conference in the 1970s where Ruth Bader Ginsburg, founder of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, delivered a keynote address. Ginsburg's vision of gender equality, which sought to free both sexes from gender-based assumptions and stereotypes, inspired the author and many others in their pursuit of civil rights through legal work. Ginsburg's Supreme Court advocacy was notable for her belief in incremental legal change and her respect for precedent and judicial restraint. She was critical of broad, sweeping decisions, as exemplified by her critique of Roe v. Wade. Ginsburg's decisions often included thorough historical contexts, particularly in gender discrimination cases, and she acknowledged the reality of systemic discrimination in her analyses of affirmative action. She brought personal experiences to her legal understanding, as seen in her dissent in the Lilly Ledbetter pay discrimination case. Ginsburg's influence extended beyond her own decisions to those of her colleagues and lower-court judges. Later in her career, she became a more frequent dissenter as the court's composition changed. The author reflects on how Ginsburg's approach and mentorship shaped her own legal career, including a personal anecdote involving Ginsburg and the author's mother.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Ginsburg as a nuanced thinker on affirmative action. Ginsburg recognized the persistence of racial inequity in various societal sectors and saw affirmative action as a response to ""centuries of law-sanctioned inequality."" She was aware of the systemic discrimination and the need to address it through legal means. Ginsburg's approach was to meticulously detail the social and historical context of cases, suggesting that she valued a deeply informed and careful consideration of affirmative action policies. Her perspective was that affirmative action should be understood within the broader dialogue about equality, historical discrimination, and the ongoing effects of such discrimination. The author seems to align with Ginsburg's view, underscoring the importance of recognizing and addressing systemic discrimination through the law."	0.03297	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action in the provided text summary. The main focus of the text is on the outcome of the Breonna Taylor case and the broader implications for African-American trust in government and law enforcement. The author discusses systemic racism and the lack of accountability in the criminal justice system, and while affirmative action is mentioned in passing, it is not the subject of analysis or opinion in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the outcome of the Breonna Taylor case, where the Kentucky Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, announced that no police officers would be charged directly with her death. Instead, one officer was charged with endangering Taylor's neighbors. The author criticizes Cameron's reference to ""mob justice"" in describing protests against racial injustice and police brutality, highlighting the historical context of actual mob justice in the form of lynchings in the South. The author reflects on the broader implications of this outcome for African-American trust in government and law enforcement, citing the cumulative toll of such incidents on the community. The author also shares personal experiences with racism and the unpreparedness one can feel in the face of such systemic issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus on affirmative action as its main subject, the author touches on the topic when discussing the racial realizations of African-Americans. The author mentions how affirmative action is often brought up in conversations about college admissions, suggesting that it might be seen as a way for African-Americans to access higher education. However, the author's main focus is on the systemic racism and the lack of accountability in the criminal justice system, rather than an in-depth analysis of affirmative action policies. The brief mention of affirmative action seems to be within the context of the broader societal challenges African-Americans face, rather than a critique or endorsement of the policy itself."	0.028810000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author clearly supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their critical view of the Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale and their belief in the necessity of race-conscious admissions policies to achieve racial equity and diversity. They highlight the underrepresentation of certain racial groups in faculty positions and the importance of affirmative action in rectifying historical injustices. The author's advocacy for Yale's commitment to maintaining its affirmative action policy, despite the federal challenge, and their emphasis on the importance of defending such policies to ensure fair opportunities for underrepresented students, indicate a strong endorsement of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece by a Yale undergraduate and former student-body president, who argues that Yale University is being unjustly targeted by the Trump administration for its affirmative action policies in admissions. The author points out that Yale has a long history of slow progress toward racial equality, citing the time it took to rename a building associated with a pro-slavery advocate and the struggle to empower its ethnic studies department. The author highlights the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American faculty at Yale and emphasizes the need for more diversity on campus.

The Trump administration filed a lawsuit against Yale, accusing it of discriminating against Asian American and White applicants, and ordered the university to halt the consideration of race in admissions for a year. The author references a similar case against Harvard, where removing race as a consideration in admissions would significantly reduce the representation of African American and Hispanic students. The author also discusses the disparities in school poverty and resources that affect students of color, which are crucial for their future advancement.

Yale's president has stated the university will not change its admissions policies, and the student body has criticized the administration's allegations. The author expresses concern that the Trump administration's actions against affirmative action could lead to a Supreme Court case that might endanger race-conscious admissions due to the court's conservative majority. The author concludes by reaffirming the importance of affirmative action and the commitment of Yale students to support the university's policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is a strong advocate for affirmative action and believes that Yale, and institutions like it, still have a significant way to go in terms of achieving racial equity and diversity. He views affirmative action as essential for rectifying historical injustices and for creating a diverse educational environment that reflects excellence. The author is critical of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle race-conscious admissions policies, seeing them as attempts to reverse progress and undermine equity in higher education. He emphasizes the importance of supporting and defending affirmative action to ensure that underrepresented students have fair opportunities for advancement and representation in elite institutions like Yale."	0.03188	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is an essential tool for achieving economic parity and addressing racial disparities. The author criticizes the dismantling of affirmative action, suggesting that it is a setback for equality. This indicates that the author is in favor of affirmative action, and the use of strong language to denounce its dismantling suggests a deep commitment to the policy. The author's frustration with Trump's claims and the defense of the progress made by African Americans before Trump's presidency further underscores the support for affirmative action as a means to counteract systemic inequalities.	"Summary:
The author expresses deep frustration and anger at Donald Trump's claims that he has done more for the Black community than any other president since Abraham Lincoln. The author is offended by Trump's suggestion that Black people should be grateful for his actions, comparing his rhetoric to that of a slave master. The author criticizes Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for perpetuating racist stereotypes about African Americans being lazy and unable to succeed without the help of a white savior. The author refutes these claims by highlighting the economic progress made by African Americans before Trump's presidency and denounces the idea that Trump is a savior to the Black community. The author also points out the hypocrisy of Kushner and Trump, who both come from wealth, and criticizes the dismantling of affirmative action, which has been an important tool for achieving economic parity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a critical equalizer that has helped bridge the gap to economic parity for African Americans. They suggest that the system in America has historically offered little or no assistance to Black people and has actively fought against measures like affirmative action that aim to level the playing field. The author believes that affirmative action is an important tool for addressing racial and economic disparities and implies that its dismantling is a setback for achieving equality."	0.025979999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	Richard Rodriguez, the author of 'Hunger of Memory,' is portrayed as holding a critical view of affirmative action, which he discusses in the context of his personal experiences. His opposition to affirmative action is based on his belief in the importance of assimilation and his view that affirmative action acts as a barrier to this process. He shares his journey from a working-class background to becoming a 'scholarship boy,' which involved a cultural and linguistic shift. Rodriguez's perspective is presented as a moral and personal argument, indicating a stance against affirmative action.	"Summary:

The text provided is a collection of summaries of various essay collections from different authors, each offering unique perspectives and intellectual challenges.

1. ""On the Contrary"" by Mary McCarthy (1961) - This collection spans from 1946 to 1961 and critiques a range of topics, including politics, literature, and fashion. McCarthy is described as having a ""furiously cool, contrarian intelligence"" and discusses her journey to a liberal anticommunist position.

2. ""The Essays of Leonard Michaels"" edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009) - Michaels' posthumous collection is both critical and autobiographical, deeply personal, and reflects his upbringing and mastery of English influenced by Yiddish. His essays are described as stories about the mind at work.

3. ""Speak, Memory"" by Vladimir Nabokov (1951) - Nabokov's memoir consists of autobiographical essays that recount his aristocratic childhood and life before the Bolsheviks' takeover, as well as his years of exile and literary apprenticeship.

4. ""Hunger of Memory"" by Richard Rodriguez (1982) - Rodriguez's debut critiques bilingual education and affirmative action based on his personal experiences. He discusses the cultural and linguistic transition from his intimate family life to the public world of education.

5. ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" by Susan Sontag (1980) - Sontag's collection includes a variety of essays, from tributes to cultural figures she admired to critiques, reflecting a more personal and emotionally warm approach to her subjects.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

Richard Rodriguez, the author of ""Hunger of Memory,"" holds a critical view of affirmative action. He opposes it based on his personal experience, arguing that the distance between his private life and public schooling shaped his understanding. Rodriguez believes in the importance of assimilation and sees affirmative action as a barrier to this process. His perspective is informed by his journey from a working-class background to becoming a ""scholarship boy,"" which involved a cultural and linguistic shift away from his family's intimate Spanish-speaking environment to the broader, English-speaking educational system. He acknowledges the loss of his familial closeness but also recognizes the gains from his educational achievements. Rodriguez's stance is controversial but is presented as a deeply moral and personal argument, blending detachment with a longing for connection to his roots."	0.03758	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author, Devon Westhill, expresses a critical view of affirmative action, particularly when it involves race- and sex-based discrimination in the allocation of public funds. His argument that such discrimination is legally dubious and morally unjust, along with his citation of legal precedent against affirmative-action programs in California, indicates a clear opposition to race- and sex-based selection criteria. Additionally, his personal anecdote about his white mother being excluded from such a program despite facing economic hardship and discrimination underscores his stance against using race and sex as factors for public assistance. Westhill's concern that race-based policies could exacerbate social divisions further illustrates his opposition to affirmative action as implemented in the Marin UBI experiment.	"Summary:
Marin County, California, is initiating a universal basic income (UBI) experiment where 125 low-income residents will receive $1,000 monthly payments starting in May. The program is funded by both the Marin Community Foundation and the Marin County Board of Supervisors. Unlike a similar program in Stockton, California, the Marin experiment has a specific eligibility criterion: recipients must be ""mothers of color,"" excluding fathers and white mothers. The author, who grew up poor with a white mother, argues that this race- and sex-based selection for public assistance is legally questionable and morally unjust.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Devon Westhill, is critical of affirmative action, particularly when it involves race- and sex-based discrimination in public funding, as seen in the Marin UBI scheme. He believes that such discrimination is legally dubious under the California Constitution and the federal 14th Amendment, both of which require strict scrutiny for racial and sex classifications. Westhill cites a legal precedent, Connerly v. State Personnel Board, which invalidated similar affirmative-action programs in California.

Westhill shares a personal anecdote to illustrate his point that excluding individuals based on race can lead to injustices, even among those who share similar economic hardships. He argues that his white mother, who raised biracial children and faced discrimination in predominantly black communities, would have been unjustly excluded from the Marin UBI program despite her low-income status and the challenges she faced.

The author is concerned that such race-based policies could exacerbate social divisions and taint well-intentioned policies like UBI with accusations of racism. He suggests that these policies, while aiming to address poverty, might instead be seen as attempts at reparative racial justice, which could undermine their effectiveness and acceptance. Westhill's perspective is that public assistance programs should be inclusive and not discriminate based on race or sex, to ensure fairness and avoid deepening racial discord."	0.02794	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author addresses systemic inequities and criticizes the current state of affirmative action in elite universities, suggesting that it benefits the wealthy and perpetuates inequality. While the author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action as a concept, they appear to advocate for policies that provide equal opportunities and reduce racial disparities. The criticism of how affirmative action is implemented at elite universities indicates a desire for a more equitable system. The author's focus on broader policies to address systemic issues suggests they may support affirmative action if it's part of a larger strategy to address racial inequities. However, due to the lack of explicit support or rejection of affirmative action as a whole, the author's stance is somewhat ambiguous.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the extensive coverage of police violence against Black Americans following George Floyd's murder, contrasting it with the less-discussed systemic inequities that disproportionately affect Black lives. The author highlights the significant disparity in life expectancy between Black and white Americans and criticizes the media for not adequately addressing such inequities. The piece points out the role of liberal white Americans in perpetuating racial disparities, especially in the education system, where school funding based on local property taxes leads to segregation and unequal opportunities. The author also discusses the historical context of school funding and the Supreme Court's role in maintaining the status quo. The text criticizes legacy admissions in elite universities, exclusionary zoning laws, and a biased tax system. It suggests early childhood programs, wealth redistribution, and job training as solutions to reduce racial disparities, and notes that framing these policies as class-based rather than race-based may garner more support. The author hopes the awareness raised by the Floyd case can lead to broader recognition and action against systemic inequities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially regarding how it is implemented in elite universities. They describe legacy preferences and donor considerations as a form of affirmative action for the privileged, leading to a disproportionate number of students from the richest 1% attending these institutions compared to those from the poorest 60%. The author implies that this form of affirmative action perpetuates inequality and benefits wealthy white Americans, rather than addressing historical and systemic disadvantages faced by underrepresented groups. The author seems to advocate for policies that promote equal opportunity and reduce racial disparities but suggests that these policies should be framed in ways that are more likely to receive broad public support."	0.04125	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective suggests that they are in favor of affirmative action. They express concern over the potential rollback of progressive values and social reforms, including affirmative action, under a Republican governor. The author's inclusion of affirmative action as part of California's positive evolution towards tolerance and equality indicates support for these policies. The author's fear that a recall of Newsom could threaten the state's commitment to fighting discrimination and inequality further underscores their favorable stance towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential consequences of the recall of California Governor Gavin Newsom, arguing that the state's values are at stake. It highlights the importance of protecting natural resources, promoting diversity, tolerance, and equality, embracing democracy, and supporting marginalized communities. The text criticizes the leading Republican recall candidates, particularly Larry Elder, for not aligning with Californian values such as environmental protection, climate goals, and social reforms. It emphasizes the state's efforts under Newsom's leadership to reverse discriminatory policies, expand voting access, and strengthen the social safety net. The author fears that these values and achievements may be lost if Newsom is recalled and replaced by a Republican governor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as part of California's evolution into a state that values tolerance and equality. They acknowledge past discriminatory actions, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and various ballot measures against immigrant rights, affirmative action, and same-sex marriage. However, they note that California has become more progressive over the last decade. The author is concerned that the recall of Newsom could jeopardize the state's commitment to fighting discrimination and inequality, as many Republican candidates deny the existence of these issues. The author implies support for affirmative action policies by listing them among the positive changes that have happened in California, suggesting that these policies contribute to a more equitable society."	0.0268	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they highlight it as an example of an issue that might not resonate with the broader electorate and could potentially alienate the groups it is intended to benefit. This perspective is based on the analysis provided by David Shor, which the author uses to argue that the Democratic Party's focus on such issues might be politically damaging. The author's stance is not strongly against affirmative action, but they express skepticism about its political viability and suggest that Democrats should prioritize other issues that have wider appeal among voters.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived liberal media bias and its potential impact on Democratic politics. The author reflects on a column by Ezra Klein regarding progressive election analyst David Shor's views. Shor believes the Democratic Party's focus on issues important to its young, educated activist base, such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action, may be politically damaging as these issues do not resonate as strongly with the broader electorate. He suggests that Democrats should prioritize issues that are already popular among voters to gain and maintain power. However, this pragmatic approach may be difficult to sell to idealistic campaign staff and journalists. The media's leftward tilt and its influence on campaign coverage could make it challenging for Democrats to shift away from divisive identity politics. The author also mentions the media's changing business model, which increasingly relies on a politically engaged, educated subscriber base that may prefer progressive language and policies. Ultimately, the author warns that the media's alignment with the left could lead to an electoral disaster for Democrats if they fail to connect with the wider population, most of whom do not have a bachelor's degree.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as presented in the context of the text, is that it is one of the issues that may not be as popular with voters of color as Democrats might expect. The author suggests that while affirmative action is intended to benefit these voters, its focus by the party could potentially alienate some of the very groups it aims to support. This view is informed by David Shor's analysis, which posits that issues most exciting to the activist base and journalists may not align with the priorities of the broader electorate, including voters of color. The author seems to suggest that a more pragmatic approach, which involves prioritizing popular issues over those that are more controversial or less widely supported, might be more beneficial for the Democratic Party's electoral success."	0.03075	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the current extreme interpretations of the concept. While acknowledging the original intent of affirmative action to address past discrimination and create equal opportunities, the author is concerned that the current approach, which they associate with Ibram X. Kendi's ideas, is counterproductive. The author believes that this extreme form of affirmative action, which they perceive as promoting more discrimination, undermines principles of unity and equal opportunity, suggesting a stance that is somewhat against the current interpretation of affirmative action while not necessarily against the original concept.	"Summary:
The author, who has been engaged in political analysis for over two decades, expresses deep disillusionment with the current state of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. Initially a registered Democrat, the author changed to an independent while working as a reporter and has maintained that status, believing that party affiliation should not influence journalistic credibility. The author criticizes the Republican Party, particularly under the influence of Donald Trump, for undermining the foundations of the republic, including election integrity, and for promoting an exclusionary view of American identity based on race and ethnicity. On the other hand, the author is equally critical of the Democratic Party, which is seen as abandoning traditional American ideals of citizenship and embracing a divisive focus on identity politics. The author is particularly concerned with the extreme positions on affirmative action and the policing of language by the left, which are perceived as counterproductive to the principles of unity and equality. Feeling alienated from both parties, the author speculates on the potential for an independent presidential candidate or a reformist Democratic leader to emerge, but remains uncertain about the future direction of American politics.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex. While they express support for the concept of affirmative action as it was envisioned during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency, which aims to address past discrimination and create equal opportunities, they are critical of what they perceive as the current extreme interpretation of affirmative action. The author references Ibram X. Kendi's book ""How to Be an Antiracist"" and disagrees with Kendi's assertion that the remedy to past and present discrimination is more discrimination in the future. The author views this approach as akin to social upheaval rather than a pursuit of true equality, and they are concerned that it undermines the ideal of reducing individuals to more than just demographic categories. The author suggests that affirmative action, in its extreme form as advocated by some on the left, does not align with the principles of unity and equal opportunity that should be at the heart of American liberalism."	0.04012	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's focus in the text is primarily on the concept of hate speech and the government's role in policing thoughts and expressions, rather than affirmative action itself. The text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action but suggests a concern for the freedom to oppose policies like affirmative action without being labeled as hate speech. The author's perspective on free speech and caution against government overreach implies a skepticism towards policies that may limit open debate, which could include affirmative action. However, without a clear stance for or against affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's position on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers for hate crimes, raising concerns about the implications of punishing individuals for their beliefs or thoughts, in addition to their criminal actions. The author argues that the federal conviction for violating Arbery's civil rights due to his race, after the state conviction for murder, can be seen as a form of virtue signaling by the government. The text criticizes Supreme Court decisions that allow such federal prosecutions without considering them double jeopardy and that hate crime punishments do not violate the First Amendment. The author is wary of the government's role in determining which thoughts are punishable and cautions against the potential for increased censorship and punishment for hate speech. The text also touches on the broader issue of government overreach and the proliferation of federal crimes, including recent hate crime legislation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of the concept of hate speech and its application, which can include opposition to policies like race-based affirmative action. The author suggests that labeling opposition to affirmative action as hate speech is part of an overbroad and subjective interpretation of the term. This perspective implies that the author may view affirmative action as a contentious issue that should be open to debate without the risk of being categorized as hate speech. The author emphasizes the importance of free speech and the danger of government overreach in policing thought and expression, which could extend to discussions around affirmative action."	0.026760000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author views affirmative action positively, as evidenced by their favorable mention of Justice O'Connor's shift to support affirmative action and the emphasis on the importance of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's diverse background, which includes but extends beyond race. The author's critique of the narrow focus on race in the discourse around Supreme Court nominees suggests an appreciation for the broader goals of affirmative action, which aim to achieve equity and representation across various dimensions of diversity.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the impact of Justice Thurgood Marshall's stories and perspectives on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, initially known for her opposition to affirmative action and strong states' rights stance. Despite this, by her retirement in 2006, O'Connor had shifted her views, notably preserving affirmative action in university admissions. The author suggests that, while not solely responsible, Marshall's influence on O'Connor should not be overlooked. The author then shifts to discussing President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, drawing parallels with Justice Stephen Breyer, whom she is set to replace, but also highlighting the importance of her diverse background beyond race. The author criticizes the narrow focus on race in discussions about the nominee and emphasizes the broader dimensions of diversity she would bring to the Court. The text concludes by reflecting on Judge Jackson's potential to inspire change in perspectives among her future colleagues, even if she doesn't change the court's direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action favorably, as indicated by their positive portrayal of Justice O'Connor's eventual support for it and the significance they place on the diversity Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would bring to the Supreme Court. The author critically addresses the narrow focus on race and affirmative action in the discourse surrounding Supreme Court nominees, suggesting that such discussions often fail to consider the full spectrum of a nominee's background and experiences. The author seems to advocate for a more nuanced understanding of diversity, which includes but is not limited to race, and implies that affirmative action is part of this broader conversation about equity and representation."	0.04903	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, David Bernstein, does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided summary. However, based on his criticism of one-sided approaches to teaching about race and his advocacy for a balanced approach that includes multiple narratives, it can be inferred that he might favor a nuanced discussion of affirmative action that considers different perspectives. Since there is no direct mention of his stance on affirmative action, we cannot conclusively categorize his position. Therefore, based on the information provided, he appears to be neutral, advocating for open debate and critical thinking rather than taking a clear stance for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
David Bernstein, the author, discusses the polarized debate over how race and racism should be taught in American public schools. He criticizes the highly ideological and prescriptive nature of current teachings, as exemplified by an ""Antiracist Audit"" from his children's school district in Maryland. Bernstein argues that this approach imparts opinions as facts and stifles open debate, critical thinking, and the consideration of multiple perspectives. He shares personal anecdotes of his son's experiences in school, where discussions on race are omnipresent and allow for only one perspective. Bernstein is concerned that both right-leaning efforts to ban certain teachings and left-leaning tendencies to demonize alternative ideas are detrimental to education. He advocates for a balanced approach that includes multiple narratives and scholarly perspectives on American history and contemporary racial issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bernstein's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from his broader views on teaching about race and racism. He is critical of a one-sided approach that may present certain views as indisputable facts. In the context of affirmative action, he seems to support the idea that students should be exposed to various sides of the debate. He is concerned that overly broad policies, such as the Virginia governor's executive order to end the use of ""divisive concepts,"" might inadvertently suppress discussions on affirmative action and other important topics. Bernstein appears to value a comprehensive education that does not shy away from controversial subjects but rather encourages critical examination and discussion of different viewpoints, including those on affirmative action."	0.03104	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Linda Linton, expresses concern that the Supreme Court's decision could lead to the erosion of affirmative action along with other rights. By grouping affirmative action with LGBTQ rights and states' rights as issues that are at risk, Linton indicates that she views affirmative action as an important civil right. This concern shows that she likely supports affirmative action and sees it as necessary for maintaining equality and preventing discrimination.	"Summary:
The text consists of several letters to the editor expressing concerns and opinions following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Linda Linton worries about the future of the country, fearing that the decision could lead to the erosion of LGBTQ rights, affirmative action, and states' rights. Michael D. Abell equates the decision to a victory for the Southern states in the Civil War, suggesting it could lead to a rollback of civil rights and a return to segregationist policies. George Miller warns that Title IX, which protects against sex discrimination in education, might be at risk due to the rationale used to overturn Roe v. Wade. Julie Thostenson, on the other hand, argues that pregnancy is a result of personal actions and that individuals should take responsibility to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the broader context of their concern about the rollback of civil rights. The author, Linda Linton, groups affirmative action with other rights that could be threatened by the Supreme Court's decision. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as an important civil right that is at risk of being undermined by the current trajectory of the Supreme Court. The concern implies that the author likely supports affirmative action and sees it as a crucial tool for ensuring equality and preventing discrimination."	0.02345	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, Justin Driver, is portrayed as advocating for a middle path regarding affirmative action. He acknowledges the historical significance of affirmative action but suggests a gradual transition to race-neutral admissions policies. His stance indicates that he sees value in affirmative action as a temporary measure but believes that it should not be a permanent solution. This perspective shows a nuanced understanding of the issue, recognizing both the benefits of affirmative action in promoting diversity and the potential need for change over time.	"Summary:
The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Despite affirmative action being banned in nine states and public opinion being divided, with a 2019 Pew Research Center survey showing 73% of Americans opposing the consideration of race in college admissions, the debate continues. Justin Driver, a Yale law professor and former clerk to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, suggests a middle path that allows institutions time to transition to race-neutral admissions before affirmative action is potentially phased out. Linda Greenhouse and Renu Mukherjee also provide perspectives on the issue, with Mukherjee advocating for race-neutral policies based on her personal experience.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Justin Driver, seems to advocate for a gradual transition away from affirmative action while acknowledging its historical importance. He references Justice O’Connor's opinion from the Grutter v. Bollinger case, which suggested that the need for racial preferences in admissions would diminish over time. Driver seems to support a timeline for institutions to adjust their admissions policies to become race-neutral, implying that affirmative action should not be an indefinite solution but rather a temporary measure to promote diversity in higher education. This perspective recognizes the complexity of the issue and the need for a thoughtful approach to creating diverse educational environments without permanent reliance on race-based affirmative action policies."	0.028269999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the text are critical of the Supreme Court's conservative decisions and their implications for civil rights, including affirmative action. They specifically mention the Court's stance as 'poised to reverse a decision upholding affirmative action in school admissions,' framing it as a negative departure from the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education. This criticism of the Court's direction regarding affirmative action and the emphasis on the importance of the courts in protecting civil rights suggest that the authors are in favor of affirmative action. However, since the main focus of the article is on the broader issues of the judiciary and not solely on affirmative action, it is not clear if their support is strong or moderate.	"Summary:
The article discusses Chief Justice John Roberts's 2022 year-end report on the federal judiciary, which notably omits any mention of significant issues that have affected the court in the past year, such as the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices, the leak of a draft decision on abortion rights, and questions about financial disclosures. Instead, the report highlights the passage of a law to protect judges and their families' personal information, a response to the murder of a judge's son. The authors note a decline in federal court usage, as evidenced by reduced filings in appellate and trial-level civil cases, attributing this trend to the Supreme Court's conservative decisions that discourage civil rights lawyers from pursuing cases and the Court's interpretations of the Federal Arbitration Act, which have favored private arbitration over court litigation. The authors argue that Congress needs to act to reinvigorate federal rights and ensure access to the courts, as it did with the amendment to the arbitration statute for victims of sexual assault and harassment.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express a critical perspective on the Supreme Court's approach to affirmative action, suggesting that the Court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding affirmative action in school admissions. They point out that this would be a departure from the legacy of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which the entire Court supported in 1954 and reaffirmed in 1958. The authors imply that the current Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Roberts, is not interested in continuing the tradition of protecting civil rights and making the courts accessible to all, as was the case with the desegregation efforts of the 1950s. They see the potential reversal of affirmative action as part of a broader trend of the Court closing the courthouse doors to many would-be litigants and retreating from its role in advancing civil rights."	0.03425	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author of the text, William McGurn, expresses a critical view of affirmative action policies in the context of Fairfax County public schools. He highlights the negative consequences of these policies on high-achieving students, especially Asian-Americans, and suggests that the pursuit of equal outcomes regardless of merit is a form of discrimination. His focus on the decreased percentage of Asian-American students at Thomas Jefferson High School following changes in admissions policy, the implication that equity efforts are going too far, and the overall tone of skepticism towards the actions of school officials indicate a stance that is critical of the current implementation of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the controversy surrounding the failure of several high schools in Northern Virginia to inform students of their recognition by the National Merit Scholarship Program. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation into the matter. The issue is seen in the broader context of the equity agenda in Fairfax County public education, which critics argue has become a war on high achievers, particularly affecting Asian-American students. The article cites the changes in admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ), which resulted in a decreased percentage of Asian-American students and an increase in African-American, Hispanic, and white students. The author also mentions a $455,000 contract with a consultant who defines equity as ""equal outcomes for every student, without exception,"" and an incident where a TJ mom was told that the school delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of non-qualifiers. The piece ends by questioning the trustworthiness of school officials given their actions and past events.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William McGurn, appears to be critical of affirmative action as it is currently implemented in the context of the Fairfax County public schools. He suggests that affirmative action, initially intended to prevent discrimination, has evolved into a form of discrimination against high-achieving students, particularly those of Asian-American descent. McGurn points to the changes in TJ's admissions policy as evidence of this, noting the reduction in Asian-American students' representation following the policy's implementation. The author also implies that the concept of equity, as pursued by school officials and consultants, is problematic if it means achieving equal outcomes for all students regardless of individual achievement. McGurn's perspective is that the actions taken in the name of equity and affirmative action have led to resentment and a devaluation of merit and achievement, particularly affecting Asian-American students and their families."	0.03087	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author, Vivek Ramaswamy, is characterized as 'strongly against' affirmative action based on the text summary provided. Ramaswamy's stance is evidenced by his explicit pledge to eliminate affirmative action, his criticism of race-based hiring preferences, and his intent to prosecute what he considers illegal race-based discrimination. He emphasizes a return to merit-based systems and criticizes affirmative action as divisive, suggesting that it undermines the accomplishments of certain groups and fosters resentment. Ramaswamy's perspective is clear in his advocacy for a merit-based system over any form of racial or ethnic preferences.	"Summary:
Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old entrepreneur, announces his candidacy for President of the United States, framing it as both a political campaign and a cultural movement. He argues that America is facing a national identity crisis, with traditional values like faith, patriotism, and hard work in decline, and people turning to ""secular religions"" for meaning. Ramaswamy criticizes the Republican Party for failing to offer a compelling alternative to the ""woke agenda"" and proposes a new American Dream focused on excellence rather than just wealth. His vision includes restoring merit-based systems for immigration, education, employment, and governance. He pledges to eliminate affirmative action, revoke executive orders mandating race-based hiring preferences, and prosecute illegal race-based discrimination. Ramaswamy also advocates for free speech, proposing to protect political expression as a civil right and to expose government pressure on tech companies to censor content. Additionally, he outlines a strategy to counteract China's global influence, emphasizing energy independence and technological self-sufficiency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ramaswamy holds a critical view of affirmative action, seeing it as antithetical to a merit-based system. He argues that affirmative action policies, such as those mandated by Executive Order 11246, result in race-based hiring preferences that disadvantage qualified white and Asian-American applicants, fostering resentment and undermining the accomplishments of black and Hispanic hires. Ramaswamy believes that these policies are divisive and counterproductive, and as president, he would seek to eliminate affirmative action across the American economy. He also expresses intent to direct the Justice Department to prosecute what he deems as illegal race-based preferences. His perspective is rooted in a belief that merit should be the sole determinant of success in America, and that the government should not impose racial or ethnic preferences in any sphere of American life."	0.032299999999999995	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's primary focus is on criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court for its partisanship and policy-making decisions, which they believe deviate from traditional judicial standards. While the text does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action, it is implied that they are critical of the Court's handling of affirmative action cases, viewing it as part of a right-wing policy agenda. The author's concern is more with the process and legitimacy of how the Court is making decisions rather than with affirmative action policy itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided text, as their critique is centered on the Court's impartiality and adherence to legal principles rather than on the merits or demerits of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The author of the text criticizes the current U.S. Supreme Court for its perceived partisanship and deviation from traditional judicial standards. They argue that the Court has overstepped its constitutional role by making policy decisions that overturn established laws and affect Americans' lives, particularly in areas such as women's health, college admissions, student aid, and public accommodations. The author contends that the Court's refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, inconsistent application of legal principles, and engagement in partisan behavior undermines its legitimacy and impartiality. They highlight that the Court's decisions often align with a right-wing agenda and suggest that the Court has manufactured cases to reach desired policy outcomes. The author calls for reforms such as term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion, and ethics reform to preserve democracy and ensure that the Court does not overrule the will of the people and their elected representatives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decisions on affirmative action as part of a broader pattern of the Court imposing a right-wing policy agenda rather than adhering to consistent legal principles. They express concern that the Court is subverting self-government by overturning precedent and making rulings that reflect partisan views rather than objective legal analysis. The text suggests that the Court's handling of affirmative action is an example of how it has strayed from its role as a neutral arbiter of the law and instead has become an active policymaker, which the author believes is detrimental to the principles of democracy."	0.03326	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses a nuanced view that acknowledges both the negative impact of ending affirmative action on students of color and the potential long-term consequences for academia. They show concern for the decreased diversity in college enrollments that might result from the removal of affirmative action. The mention of a humorous wish for the Supreme Court to be an AI chatbot suggests a critique of the current decision-making process and possibly a desire for a more equitable system. Despite discussing the rise of AI and its impact on the job market, the author still sees affirmative action as relevant for ensuring diversity and opportunity in higher education. This perspective indicates that the author is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its benefits and the problems with its removal, but they do not provide a strong, explicit endorsement or a detailed argument in support of it.	"Summary:
The author discusses the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action in college admissions, juxtaposing it with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on the job market. The author suggests that with AI taking over many white-collar jobs, the value of a traditional college education may be diminishing. They argue that practical skills for jobs that AI cannot perform might become more important, such as outdoor or physically demanding work. The author highlights personal stories of individuals who have lost writing jobs to AI and have since transitioned to other careers. They also mention a new ""wearable AI assistant"" that aims to humanize technology by reducing the need for other devices. The author acknowledges the potential for AI to enhance creativity but also warns of the risks it poses to traditional employment. They emphasize that AI lacks the emotional depth and experiential memory to replace human creativity fully, as evidenced by a client who returned to a human writer after finding AI-generated content lacking.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. They recognize the immediate negative impact of its removal on students of color who might have benefited from such programs. The author also suggests that the long-term loser might be academia itself, as the end of affirmative action could lead to decreased diversity in college enrollments. They express concern about the broader implications of this shift, especially as AI begins to influence which fields are dominated by humans. The author hints at skepticism about the Supreme Court's view that affirmative action is no longer needed, sharing a quote from Suzanne Szostak, who humorously wishes that the Supreme Court was an AI chatbot, likely implying a desire for a more just or empathetic decision-making process. Overall, the author implies that affirmative action still has a role to play in ensuring diversity and opportunity in higher education, especially in an era where the value of such education is being questioned due to technological advancements."	0.034269999999999995	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt	1
	None	The provided summary does not directly address affirmative action but rather focuses on a Supreme Court case related to discrimination against same-sex couples. While the text references the Supreme Court's 'gutting of affirmative action,' it does not offer enough context to determine the author's specific stance on affirmative action itself. The mention of affirmative action is incidental to the discussion of another issue, and there is insufficient information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text contains opinions from various individuals reacting to the Supreme Court's decision in the 303 Creative v. Elenis case, where a web designer refused to provide services to same-sex couples. Michael D. Schattman highlights the absurdity of the case, noting that it involved a business not wanting to provide a service for a hypothetical scenario. Kathy Viney draws parallels between the justifications for discrimination in the case and historical apartheid in South Africa. Ravin Bhatia expresses fear for the future rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, concerned that discrimination could become justified under religious freedom or free speech. Aimée La Fountain is astonished by the misrepresentations in the case and suggests potential legal repercussions for the plaintiff. David Dorsen points out the complexity of the issue, suggesting that rights can be double-edged swords, and wonders about the reaction if the roles were reversed in a hypothetical situation involving a talented Black gay web designer and white supremacists.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. However, there is a mention of the Supreme Court's ""gutting of affirmative action"" as part of its track record, which implies a negative view of the Court's actions regarding affirmative action. This suggests that the author or the individuals quoted may view the Supreme Court's decisions on affirmative action as a step backward in achieving equality and justice, aligning with the broader concerns about the rights of minority groups being undermined by recent rulings."	0.02354	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Ibert Schultz, is depicted as a staunch advocate for affirmative action, primarily due to his role as the executive director of an organization dedicated to helping Black students access higher education. Schultz's concerns about the decline in Black student enrollment following the ban on affirmative action in California and his belief in the necessity of such policies to address systemic disadvantages and promote equality in college admissions indicate a strong support for affirmative action. His fear that 'colorblind' admissions will reduce opportunities for Black students and be detrimental to society further underscores his firm stance in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action on college admissions, particularly highlighting the experiences in California since Proposition 209 was passed in 1996, which led to a significant decrease in Black student enrollment in state colleges and universities. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit that helps Black students in South Los Angeles gain access to higher education. Schultz describes the challenges these students face, such as low family incomes and low community college graduation rates, and shares success stories of students who have been admitted to prestigious colleges. The organization provides comprehensive support, from academic planning to college application assistance. Schultz emphasizes that a combination of academics, guidance, and student determination leads to success. However, he expresses concern that the move towards ""colorblind"" admissions will reduce opportunities for Black students and ultimately be detrimental to society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ibert Schultz, views affirmative action as a necessary tool to help level the playing field for students who face systemic disadvantages, particularly Black students from communities with lower incomes and educational attainment. Schultz's perspective is that the removal of affirmative action policies will exacerbate inequalities in college admissions and hinder the progress of students from underrepresented groups. He believes that the unique experiences and challenges faced by Black applicants should be considered in the admissions process, and that society as a whole will lose if these perspectives are ignored. The author's work with Black College Success is a testament to his commitment to providing opportunities for these students, and he fears that without affirmative action, the already difficult task of increasing Black enrollment and graduation rates will become even more challenging."	0.02907	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to support affirmative action as they emphasize the importance of diversity efforts at UC Irvine, highlight the challenges posed by opposition to affirmative action, and underline the need for race-based preferences in hiring and admissions to achieve diversity. The author's mention of the university's ongoing efforts to improve the representation of women and minorities in faculty positions and the community's support for ethnic dialogue further suggests that the author values the outcomes that affirmative action policies aim to achieve.	"Summary:
UC Irvine has been actively engaging its academic community for over eight months to address the question of diversity under the leadership of Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. As the university prepares to establish a Diversity Council, the topic has gained urgency due to UC Regent Ward Connerly's opposition to affirmative action and his intention to end race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. A consultant found that UCI supports diversity at the top and grassroots levels but needs to strengthen it in the middle ranks, which will be a task for the Diversity Council. UCI's efforts to promote diversity extend beyond its campus; it has engaged with local high school students and alumni like Alma L. Lopez, who contributed to a cultural mural. On campus, UCI boasts a high percentage of Asian students and hosts events like the Asian Pacific Awareness Conference. However, the university recognizes the need to improve the hiring and promotion of women and minorities as faculty members. Chancellor Wilkening sees UCI's diversity as an asset, a sentiment echoed by Orange County residents who acknowledge the necessity of programs that foster dialogue among different ethnic groups.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a means to enhance diversity within the academic community. They highlight the University of California Irvine's commitment to diversity and the efforts made to promote it within and outside the campus. The author points out the challenge posed by UC Regent Ward Connerly's stance against affirmative action, suggesting that the author disagrees with Connerly and believes in the importance of race-based preferences in hiring and admissions to achieve a diverse environment. The author also notes the university's need to improve in hiring and promoting women and minorities, indicating support for affirmative action policies that could address such disparities. The reference to the community's support for dialogue among ethnic groups further underscores the author's belief in the value of diversity and, by extension, affirmative action as a tool to foster it."	0.02461	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's own perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The text mentions Colin Powell's stance on affirmative action in passing, as part of a broader discussion on his potential political candidacy and moderate views. Since the author's focus is on the political climate and Powell's positions rather than on affirmative action itself, and there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the policy, the author is categorized as 'not concerned with affirmative action' in this context.	"Summary:
The text discusses the lack of enthusiasm for the major-party presidential candidates during a campaign season, with Bill Clinton not gaining more support than he previously had, and Republican candidates like Bob Dole and Phil Gramm not generating much excitement. The author attributes this voter disinterest to a combination of the candidates' personalities and a broader dissatisfaction with the political process and the perceived options for the upcoming election. The text then shifts focus to Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is promoting his memoirs and showing signs of potentially entering the political arena. Powell's moderate stance on various issues, such as supporting some affirmative action and gun control, places him in the political middle, which is not seen as advantageous for securing a GOP nomination. However, the possibility of a Powell candidacy is supported by the public's desire for an alternative to the major parties and the strength of Powell's character. There is speculation about whether Powell could run for the presidency without a national party's backing and whether his involvement could reinvigorate a disillusioned electorate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions that Colin Powell ""supports some affirmative action,"" suggesting that Powell sees value in policies that aim to address historical inequalities and provide opportunities to underrepresented groups. However, the author does not elaborate on Powell's specific views or the extent of his support for affirmative action. The mention is brief and included in a list of Powell's positions on various issues, indicating that while affirmative action is among the issues Powell has taken a stance on, it is not the primary focus of the text. The author's own perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, as the text aims to provide an overview of Powell's political positions rather than an analysis or opinion on the policies themselves."	0.02516	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical view of the anti-affirmative action initiative, as indicated by their association of it with historical racism and discrimination, suggests a disapproval of efforts to dismantle affirmative action. The author's mention of Proposition 187 in the same context and their experiences with racism further supports the idea that they view affirmative action as a positive countermeasure to such discrimination. Additionally, the author's appreciation for the Chicano movement's efforts in advancing community rights hints at a supportive stance towards policies like affirmative action that help to promote equality and address historical injustices. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they see it as an important tool in the struggle against discrimination and for the advancement of Mexican Americans and other marginalized groups.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the celebration of Cinco de Mayo in California, a commemoration of a Mexican military victory over the French army in 1862. The author notes that while the holiday has become a commercialized celebration in the U.S., it holds particular irony or pain in light of Mexico's struggles, anti-immigration sentiments, and opposition to affirmative action initiatives in California. The author, a Texan who has adopted California as home, contrasts the overt racism experienced in Texas with the subtler forms encountered in California two decades ago. Proposition 187 and the anti-affirmative action initiative, however, evoke a sense of regression to the more blatant discrimination of Texas. Despite this, the author feels a deep attachment to California, influenced by its spiritual and cultural energy. The text also touches on the author's personal history and the cultural shifts observed among Mexican Americans who moved to California and how the Chicano movement reshaped identities. The author concludes by affirming a sense of belonging in California and celebrates Cinco de Mayo with pride.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the anti-affirmative action initiative in California, suggesting that it contributes to a ""vigilante mood"" reminiscent of historical racism and discrimination. This stance is inferred from the context in which affirmative action is mentioned, alongside Proposition 187 (an anti-immigration measure) and within a discussion of the author's experiences with racism. The author's attachment to California is tinged with melancholy due to these political developments, but there is also a sense of resilience and pride in the cultural identity and history of Mexican Americans in the state. The mention of influential leaders in the Chicano movement implies an appreciation for the efforts to advance the rights and recognition of the community, which affirmative action policies often aim to support."	0.032080000000000004	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text seems to view the elimination of affirmative action policies by the UC Board of Regents as politically motivated and detrimental to the university's mission. The author's critical stance on the political motivations behind the decision, the support for shared governance, and the concern for the university's ability to educate students—especially those from underprivileged backgrounds—suggests a perspective that is somewhat in favor of affirmative action. The author's reflection on the need for leadership that prioritizes the university's progress over political battles further supports this categorization.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historical event where UC President Clark Kerr was fired by Governor Ronald Reagan in 1967 due to Kerr's perceived leniency towards the Free Speech Movement. Decades later, the University of California system is again embroiled in controversy, this time over affirmative action. In July, the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring, a decision widely criticized as politically motivated to support Governor Pete Wilson's presidential campaign. The regents' decision was opposed by all nine UC chancellors, student governments, and activists. Richard C. Atkinson, the new UC president, was tasked with implementing the new policy but delayed it, citing the need for alternative guidelines. This led to a conflict with the regents, particularly Ward Connerly, who accused Atkinson of overstepping his authority. Atkinson eventually apologized and agreed to accelerate policy implementation. The author reflects on the political nature of these decisions and their impact on the university's ability to educate students.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a critical view of the political motivations behind the regents' decision to eliminate affirmative action policies, suggesting that it was influenced by Governor Pete Wilson's presidential ambitions. The author also seems to support the concept of ""shared governance"" and is critical of the regents' disregard for the consensus-building process traditionally involved in major policy changes. Furthermore, the author expresses concern about the impact of these political battles on the university's ability to effectively serve its students, particularly in providing outreach programs for underprivileged high school graduates. The text implies that while the regents' decision may have been constitutionally within their rights, the way it was handled and the political backdrop raise questions about the priorities and leadership within the UC system. The author calls for leaders who can guide the university forward rather than stall progress due to political infighting."	0.031509999999999996	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex and acknowledges the intricacies of the issue. While they point out the limitations of affirmative action in addressing broader societal disparities, they also recognize the historical context of racial discrimination and the importance of inclusion. The author emphasizes understanding both sides of the debate, suggesting that supporters and opponents should be aware of each other's valid concerns. The call for a more comprehensive approach to equality of opportunity indicates a belief in the need for interventions but also highlights the shortcomings of affirmative action as it currently stands. The author's balanced view does not firmly align with a strong stance either for or against affirmative action, but rather advocates for a nuanced discussion that moves beyond the current paradigm.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's perspective on affirmative action, a program designed to redistribute opportunities rather than expand them. It contrasts affirmative action with traditional redistributive programs, which are based on economic need rather than race, gender, or ethnicity, and which allow for compromise on funding and implementation. The author argues that affirmative action does not address broader disparities in society but rather focuses on the composition of those in coveted positions. The text also acknowledges the complexities of the debate, including the historical context of racial discrimination in the United States and the potential negative consequences of eliminating affirmative action programs. The author suggests that both supporters and opponents of affirmative action need to recognize the valid concerns of the other side and that a more comprehensive approach to achieving equality of opportunity is necessary.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. On one hand, they recognize that affirmative action does not address the broader issues of income and opportunity inequality in society; it simply reallocates the existing opportunities, which can be seen as a zero-sum game. The author also points out that affirmative action is based on fixed group identities, which can be problematic when it comes to addressing individual needs and circumstances.

However, the author also acknowledges the historical context of racial discrimination in the United States and the importance of ensuring that African Americans and other marginalized groups have opportunities for inclusion at all societal levels. The author cites sociologist Steven Lukes' adage that focusing on one form of injustice may lead to overlooking others, such as the unique challenges faced by affluent African Americans compared to those of a white janitor's son.

Ultimately, the author believes that the debate on affirmative action should not be reduced to demagoguery but should involve a genuine effort to understand the complexities involved. They suggest that opponents of affirmative action need to recognize that true equality of opportunity requires significant interventions, while supporters need to be aware of the program's limitations and the legitimate concerns of whites of modest means.

The perspective concludes with the idea that any commission on affirmative action should aim not to dictate moral judgments but to broaden the debate towards ensuring a more equitable distribution of opportunities for everyone, including those in the inner city and the children of white workers."	0.03517	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of its implementation when it involves numerical goals, which they believe can lead to division and a perception of a quota system. While acknowledging the benefits of diversity and the intent behind affirmative action, the author advocates for a focus on nondiscrimination and merit rather than on meeting numerical targets. This suggests a critique of affirmative action practices that prioritize numbers over quality, indicating a stance that is not fully against the concept but against certain methods of its execution.	"Summary:
The text discusses a controversy surrounding affirmative action at The Washington Post, sparked by a critical article written by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic. Shalit accuses The Post of lowering its hiring and news coverage standards to meet affirmative action goals, leading to ""racial strife."" The Post's leadership, including editor Leonard Downie Jr. and publisher Donald E. Graham, vehemently deny these allegations, defending their hiring practices and commitment to quality. The author acknowledges the emotional impact affirmative action has on white males, feeling as though there is a quota system in place, despite The Post's insistence on maintaining high standards. The broader context is the changing economic landscape, where affirmative action is becoming more challenging to justify as economic growth slows and competition increases. The author also notes that affirmative action can be a double-edged sword for minorities, citing the discomfort of some black journalists with the implications of Shalit's article. The author concludes by expressing admiration for The Post's efforts but argues that the focus should be on producing a better newspaper rather than meeting numerical goals, advocating for absolute nondiscrimination over quotas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. On one hand, the author acknowledges the positive aspects of affirmative action, such as the importance of a diversified staff and the benefits it has provided to individuals like Colin Powell. On the other hand, the author is critical of the implementation of affirmative action that relies on numerical goals, suggesting that it creates division and strife among different groups within the workplace. The author seems to sympathize with the feelings of white males who perceive affirmative action as a quota system that raises barriers for them. The author advocates for a focus on nondiscrimination and merit in hiring practices, suggesting that the true measure of success should be the quality of the newspaper produced, not the achievement of certain diversity percentages. Overall, the author supports the principles of racial justice and diversity but criticizes the approach that relies on numerical targets, which can be counterproductive and divisive."	0.030739999999999996	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be critical of affirmative action, focusing on the negative impacts it has had on white men. The discussion of reverse discrimination, the mention of white men's frustrations and resignations, and the highlighting of suppressed research on class splits in white reactions all point to a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action. The author's call for legitimate discussion and reevaluation of the policies further supports this categorization. However, the text does not advocate for the complete elimination of affirmative action, which suggests that the author's stance is not fully against the policy but rather in favor of its critical reassessment.	"Summary:
The text explores the impact of affirmative action on white men, suggesting that a significant number have been adversely affected, with one-in-ten reportedly injured by such policies. The author, while working in California's higher education system, observed affirmative action policies that went beyond considering race as one factor in decision-making to implementing quotas and set-asides. Informal data and interviews with white men revealed instances of perceived reverse discrimination, leading to frustrations, resignations, and unsuccessful lawsuits. The author notes that many white men do not openly complain for fear of being labeled racist, and their complaints are often dismissed by both liberals and conservatives. The text also references suppressed research indicating a class split in white reactions to affirmative action, with more intense anger among working-class individuals. The author argues for the legitimate discussion of affirmative action's impact on white males and cautions against automatically attributing their criticisms to racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and suggests that the policies have been implemented in ways that create a zero-sum game, particularly harming white men who are not part of the groups affirmative action aims to assist. The author argues that the policies have evolved into a form of reverse discrimination, leading to resentment, lowered standards, and a sense of victimization among white men. Additionally, the author criticizes the political and social responses to these issues, indicating that both liberals and conservatives have failed to address the concerns of white men affected by affirmative action. The text calls for an open discussion and reevaluation of affirmative action policies to address what the author perceives as their unintended negative consequences."	0.038470000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author, Clint Bolick, shows a critical stance towards affirmative action, arguing that it is increasingly irrelevant and does not address the real issues facing the black underclass. He emphasizes that the majority of black Americans prefer merit-based systems over race-based affirmative action and suggests that civil rights leadership is out of touch with its constituency on this issue. Bolick advocates for policies that empower individuals through opportunity and equality rather than social engineering strategies like racial quotas. His perspective is in line with those who are against affirmative action, as he believes in merit and ability as the primary criteria for hiring and education, and he criticizes the focus on race-based solutions.	"Summary:
The text discusses the misperception that black and white Americans have fundamentally different views and aspirations, based on survey findings from the Joint Center for Political Studies. The survey indicates that black Americans generally aspire to the same goals as other Americans, such as safe streets, good schools, and homeownership. It reveals that a significant portion of black Americans identify as conservative, even more so than those identifying as liberal or moderate, and that young blacks are particularly conservative. Despite this, very few black Americans are Republicans, suggesting a disconnect between the Republican Party and black conservatives.

The author highlights that, contrary to the positions of established civil rights groups, many black Americans support the death penalty, a back-to-basics approach to education, a voucher system for schools, and are skeptical of current welfare policies. The survey also shows a discrepancy between the views of black leaders and the black community on issues like affirmative action, with most blacks favoring ability over race as the determining factor in hiring and education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clint Bolick, is critical of affirmative action, particularly the emphasis placed on it by civil rights leaders. He argues that affirmative action does not substantially aid the black underclass, which faces issues like crime, economic stagnation, and inadequate schools. Bolick suggests that the focus on social engineering strategies, such as racial quotas and set-asides, is increasingly irrelevant to the real problems facing many black Americans and is causing civil rights leadership to become out of touch with its constituency.

Bolick points out that a large majority of black Americans prefer merit and ability to be the deciding factors over race in hiring and education. He contends that the civil rights movement should move away from a divisive racial spoils system and instead work to empower those who have been denied opportunities, aligning with traditional American ideals of equality and opportunity. The author advocates for policies that create tangible opportunities for upward mobility and criticizes the Republican Party for not effectively communicating and presenting a clear agenda to black Americans. He holds up Justice Clarence Thomas as an example of achieving the American Dream through merit and hard work, embodying the ideals to which both blacks and whites are committed."	0.0382	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author's critical stance on affirmative action is evident through their use of phrases like 'petty squabbling over `quotas,' `affirmative action' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.' This language, along with the support for a colorblind Constitution and individual merit, indicates a disapproval of affirmative action policies that take race into account. The author's alignment with Clarence Thomas's views, who is known for his skepticism towards affirmative action, further underscores their stance against such policies. Therefore, the author is likely 'strongly against' affirmative action, as they advocate for a legal approach that does not consider race and instead focuses on individual discrimination cases.	"Summary:
The text discusses the NAACP's consideration of whether to oppose the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, juxtaposed with the organization's preference for another justice like Thurgood Marshall. The author argues that, contrary to the criticism Thomas has faced, his views on equality and the Constitution closely align with those of Marshall, particularly regarding the Brown v. Board of Education case. Both Marshall and Thomas believed that the Supreme Court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional grounds rather than sociological studies. The author suggests that Thomas's perspective on a colorblind Constitution and natural rights is in service of original-intent jurisprudence, and that his approach to individual cases of discrimination is thorough. The NAACP's Benjamin Hooks acknowledges that Thomas has some good points. The text concludes by noting the similarities between Marshall and Thomas on civil rights issues and questions whether the NAACP will support Thomas despite pressure from their usual liberal allies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, referring to it as ""petty squabbling over `quotas,' `affirmative action' and race-conscious remedies of social ills."" The author seems to favor a colorblind interpretation of the Constitution, which Clarence Thomas also supports, arguing that discrimination should be addressed on an individual basis rather than through group quotas or race-based remedies. The author believes that Thomas's approach to equality, which emphasizes natural rights and the original intent of the Constitution, offers a more enduring guarantee of equality than the legal standards set by cases like Brown v. Board of Education. The perspective presented suggests a preference for individual merit and equal treatment under the law, rather than policies that take race into explicit consideration."	0.03034	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be critical of the current implementation of affirmative action, specifically the use of quotas. The author supports efforts to reform affirmative action to align with its original intent of providing individuals with a level playing field without relying on race or sex as determining factors. This perspective suggests a desire to move away from institutional mandates that can cause division and resentment, and towards a system that promotes individual merit and preparation. The author's focus on the negative consequences of race-based preferences and the support for initiatives that would abolish such preferences indicates a stance that is somewhat against the current practices of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political efforts in California to reform affirmative action, focusing on three fronts: the University of California's admissions policies, legislative action, and a potential ballot initiative. Ward Connerly, a black University of California regent and friend of Governor Pete Wilson, has been vocal in criticizing race-based admissions and has called for alternatives that do not involve quotas. Connerly advocates for marketing the university to underrepresented groups and assisting them in preparing for application without considering race or sex in admissions. Despite Connerly's stance, he has faced opposition from other regents and from defenders of quotas. Legislative efforts to abolish preferences in public admissions, hiring, and contracting are gaining traction, partly due to the California Civil Rights Initiative, which aims to outlaw quotas through a constitutional amendment. This initiative faces challenges, including the need for significant funding to collect signatures and opposition from businesses that benefit from quotas. The text suggests that there is quiet support for the initiative among moderate Democrats who are concerned about the divisive effects of race-based policies on their party and society. The author implies that the goal of the reform efforts is to restore affirmative action to its original intent—helping individuals compete on a level playing field—rather than focusing on institutional mandates.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the current implementation of affirmative action, particularly the use of quotas, and supports efforts to reform it. The author suggests that affirmative action should aim to assist individuals who need help competing on a level playing field, rather than imposing institutional mandates that can lead to resentment and division. The text highlights the perceived negative consequences of race-based preferences, such as the frustration of white and Asian-heritage students who feel that merit is not adequately recognized and the political divisiveness it causes. The author seems to advocate for a return to the original purpose of affirmative action, which is to promote individual achievement without relying on race or sex as determining factors in admissions and hiring practices."	0.03039	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective appears to be critical of Governor Weld's endorsement of affirmative action, framing it as a betrayal to his conservative supporters and a deviation from their expectations. The author highlights the negative reactions from Weld's base and implies that his stance on affirmative action is a significant factor in the erosion of his political support. The tone of the summary suggests that the author is sympathetic to the concerns of those who feel disadvantaged by affirmative action policies, which indicates that the author may be somewhat against or strongly against affirmative action.	"Summary:
William Weld, a Republican who became the Governor of Massachusetts in 1990, initially gained popularity by blending fiscal conservatism with social libertarianism. However, his time in office has seen a decline in support, particularly from conservative Democrats (""Weldocrats"") who feel betrayed by his actions, which include approving a pay raise for state legislators and supporting expensive police details for road work. His credibility as a reformer has been questioned, and his frequent out-of-state fundraising for California Governor Pete Wilson's presidential campaign has been mocked. The breaking point for many came when Weld endorsed the affirmative action status quo during a Northeastern University graduation speech, contradicting what many of his supporters believed in.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Governor Weld's endorsement of affirmative action as a major point of contention and a departure from the expectations of his core supporters. The author suggests that Weld's perspective on affirmative action is influenced by his liberal leanings and his friendship with Flash Wiley, an African-American businessman and Democratic activist. Weld's defense of affirmative action is portrayed as dismissive of the concerns of white contractors who feel disadvantaged by such policies. The author indicates that Weld's stance on affirmative action and other issues has resulted in a loss of trust among his supporters, who feel that the promise of government recognizing their values has been broken. The tone suggests that the author views Weld's support for affirmative action as a betrayal to his voter base and a sign of his shift away from their interests."	0.0338	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the primary focus of the text, but it can be inferred from the discussion on economic growth and investment in black-owned businesses. The author suggests that economic policies such as a capital gains tax cut could lead to job creation and equality within the black community, which might make affirmative action unnecessary in the long run. This implies a belief that structural economic changes can be more effective than affirmative action in achieving racial equality. However, since the text does not directly argue against the current necessity or effectiveness of affirmative action, but rather discusses an alternative approach to achieving similar goals, the author's stance seems to be 'somewhat against' affirmative action, favoring economic solutions over it.	"Summary:
The text advocates for the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to support a capital gains tax cut, arguing that it would stimulate economic growth and benefit the black community by freeing up capital for new investments, particularly in black-controlled companies. This could lead to job creation for middle- and working-class people, including those transitioning off welfare. The article notes that venture capital, which would be bolstered by such a tax cut, is effective at generating jobs and export sales. It also points out the current underrepresentation of black firms in receiving private equity and suggests initiatives to address this, such as encouraging pension funds to invest in black-owned businesses and urging brokerage firms to raise capital for them. The author believes that a capital gains tax cut would increase the flow of venture capital to black businesses, which tend to employ a high percentage of black workers. Additionally, the article suggests that supporting a capital gains tax cut could help the CBC form a strategic alliance with the Republican Congress and enhance its political influence.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author suggests that policies like a capital gains tax cut that increase investment capital for entrepreneurial endeavors by black Americans could eventually eliminate the need for affirmative action. The implication is that by fostering economic growth and job creation within the black business community, there would be a natural progression towards equality that renders affirmative action unnecessary. The author views affirmative action as a temporary measure that could be replaced by more sustainable economic policies that empower black entrepreneurs and investors."	0.02623	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of the quota-focused approach in the memo associated with Alexis Herman and the Democratic Party's convention delegate assignments indicates a disapproval of affirmative action policies that rely on quotas. The skepticism about Herman's judgment and sensitivity regarding affirmative action, coupled with the concern over factional influence, suggests the author is against the current implementation of affirmative action, particularly when it is perceived as being driven by political motives rather than fairness or diversity goals.	"Summary:
The text criticizes President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman as Labor Secretary, suggesting it was a questionable decision given the ongoing campaign-contributions controversy. The author reveals a memo titled ""Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996,"" which was associated with Herman and indicates a quota-focused approach. The text argues that while reaching out to the African-American community is appropriate, the memo reflects a programmatic mindset akin to the Democratic Party's quota assignments for its convention delegates. The author expresses concern that the Democratic Party is too influenced by its constituent factions and questions whether Herman will shift away from such factional influences once in office. The author emphasizes the importance of the Labor Secretary's role in overseeing affirmative action practices and suggests that Herman may not possess the necessary judgment and sensitivity for the position, given her involvement in the quota-related memo.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least as it is implemented by the Democratic Party and potentially by Alexis Herman. The text refers to ""quota-mongering"" and ""specific quota assignments,"" implying a negative view of affirmative action policies that rely on quotas or set numerical targets. The author is skeptical that affirmative action under Herman's leadership would be fair or effective, suggesting that it would be driven by political factionalism rather than by a genuine commitment to equality or diversity. The mention of the Texaco case, where the company was scrutinized for its affirmative action practices, further indicates the author's concern about the implementation of such policies in the corporate world. Overall, the author seems to advocate for a more thoughtful and sensitive approach to affirmative action, one that is not dominated by political pressures or rigid quotas."	0.024560000000000002	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of government-sponsored quotas and set-asides, as well as the emphasis on the need for nuance and balanced consideration, suggests a stance that is somewhat against the current implementation of affirmative action. The author does not outright reject the idea of affirmative action but highlights the potential for misuse and the importance of a more transparent and nuanced discussion. The mention of support from a notable percentage of black voters for the CCRI, which aimed to eliminate such quotas, indicates that the author acknowledges the complexities within communities supposedly benefiting from affirmative action. Overall, the author seems to be in favor of reforming affirmative action rather than completely discarding it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the polarized nature of contemporary debates, particularly around affirmative action, and the lack of nuance in public discourse. It references the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) and its aim to eliminate government-sponsored quotas and set-asides, which was met with strong opposition. Despite this, the initiative passed with support from a notable percentage of black voters. The text argues for a more nuanced discussion on affirmative action, using the case of Astroline Communications Company as an example. Astroline benefited from the FCC's minority distress sale policy, which was challenged and underwent legal scrutiny, with the Supreme Court initially upholding and later essentially reversing its stance on such set-asides. The text reveals that Astroline's minority ownership was not as significant as it appeared, raising questions about the integrity of such set-aside programs. The author suggests that the lack of willingness to engage in nuanced discussions about affirmative action undermines its credibility, especially when cases of exploitation or gaming the system, like Astroline's, come to light.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the current approach to affirmative action, particularly government-sponsored quotas and set-asides. They emphasize the need for ""useful distinctions"" and a more balanced consideration of affirmative action policies. The author points out that the all-or-nothing stance of some affirmative action proponents is not sustainable, especially when instances like Astroline's abuse of the system become public. By highlighting the case of Astroline, the author suggests that affirmative action policies can be manipulated, and without careful examination and discussion, they may lose their intended effect and credibility. The author seems to advocate for a more nuanced and transparent conversation about affirmative action, one that acknowledges its complexities and the potential for both positive outcomes and misuse."	0.028659999999999998	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is characterized by an acknowledgment of its complexity and divisiveness, yet with an underlying support for its goals and successes. The author's favorable citation of affirmative action's implementation in the military and the call for a nuanced understanding of the policy, as well as the mention of the need for less inflammatory dialogue, suggest a belief in the positive role affirmative action can play. Furthermore, the author's reference to public opinion being more favorable when affirmative action is associated with equal opportunity rather than quotas indicates a preference for a balanced approach to the policy. The author does not seem to outright advocate for or against affirmative action, but rather for a thoughtful and effective application of it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges and controversies surrounding President Clinton's initiative on race, with particular focus on affirmative action. It describes setbacks such as the exclusion of whites from a racial dialogue and a contentious town meeting in Akron. The article acknowledges the historical difficulties America has faced with race issues and commends Clinton's effort as ambitious and necessary despite its complexities. The White House is reported to be tightening control over the advisory committee on race and planning new proposals. The text also addresses the divisive nature of affirmative action, with public opinion split depending on whether it is viewed as quotas or as a means to ensure equal opportunity. The author cites the military as an example where affirmative action has been successfully implemented, with specific reference to West Point's efforts to achieve diversity. The article ends by quoting Colin Powell on the need for nuanced understanding of affirmative action and a call for less inflammatory dialogue on the topic.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, emphasizing the need for nuanced understanding and implementation. They acknowledge that affirmative action can be controversial and is often misunderstood or misrepresented. The author suggests that when affirmative action is seen as a tool for fostering equal opportunities, the public tends to support it. However, when it is perceived as quotas or rigid preferences, it faces strong opposition. The author uses the military's integration efforts as an example of affirmative action's success, noting that it has been essential in creating a more level playing field for minorities. The author also highlights the importance of dialogue and cautions against inflammatory rhetoric that can polarize the issue. They seem to advocate for a balanced approach to affirmative action, one that recognizes historical discrimination and works towards temporary measures to address it, as suggested by Colin Powell's nuanced stance. Overall, the author views affirmative action as a necessary, albeit complex, component of the broader initiative to address racial issues in America."	0.033909999999999996	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action based on their skepticism about its efficacy and potential for conflict with other business objectives. The text implies that affirmative action may involve promoting by quota, which the author seems to view unfavorably. The reference to recruiting from schools based on scholastic merit as opposed to quota-based promotions, along with the mention of California voters' rejection of racial preferences, further supports the interpretation that the author is not fully supportive of affirmative action. While the author acknowledges the existence of racial issues within organizations like Texaco, they also emphasize the importance of maintaining core business objectives and suggest that affirmative action might not be the best solution to achieve diversity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Texaco and allegations of racism based on the ""Texaco tapes,"" which were recordings made by an employee that captured conversations within the company. Initially, the media suggested that racist language, including the use of the ""n"" word, was present on the tapes, and that terms like ""black jelly bean"" were used in a derogatory manner. However, upon closer examination and enhancement of the tapes, it was found that the word in question was ""Nicholas,"" and the term ""jelly bean"" was actually used in the context of promoting diversity within the company.

The author criticizes the media for jumping to conclusions without thoroughly analyzing the evidence and for perpetuating the stereotype of ""EVIL BUSINESSMEN."" The tapes also reveal discussions within Texaco about downsizing and affirmative action, showing the company's efforts to balance cost-cutting measures with increasing diversity. Despite the initial misinterpretation of the tapes, there is evidence of internal stress over race issues at Texaco. The author suggests that the company will likely settle a lawsuit and improve its diversity programs as a result of the controversy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be skeptical about affirmative action, implying that it might conflict with downsizing goals and suggesting that it involves promoting by quota. The text mentions a character who proposes recruiting from predominantly black schools where students advance ""simply on the basis of scholastic merit,"" contrasting this with other MBA programs that are ""under the same gun as corporations"" to promote by quota. The author also references California voters' rejection of racial preferences despite their support for Bill Clinton, indicating that there is a general uncertainty about the effectiveness and appropriateness of affirmative action as a solution to racial disparities.

Overall, the author's perspective seems to lean towards the view that affirmative action may not be the best approach to achieving diversity and that it might create additional tensions within organizations. The author also suggests that there should be a balance between being sensitive to diversity and maintaining the core business objectives, such as in the case of Texaco, where the business's primary goal was finding oil."	0.03822	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be negative because it is included in a list of actions by the ABA that the author criticizes. The author believes the ABA should not be involved in endorsing affirmative action, which is seen as part of a liberal agenda outside the appropriate scope of the ABA's activities. The author's critique suggests a stance against affirmative action, although the primary focus of the text is on the ABA's role rather than affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for its perceived liberal agenda and its involvement in non-legal matters such as supporting abortion rights, endorsing affirmative action, and calling for a death penalty moratorium. The author also accuses the ABA of promoting an anti-business agenda, citing its support for easier certification of class actions and opposition to tort reform measures including loser pays rules, limits on pain and suffering awards, and product liability reform. The ABA's lobbying efforts against Republican civil justice reform and its quasi-governmental functions are also mentioned as points of conflict. The author suggests that the ABA is biased towards the plaintiffs' bar and has a selective use of evidence, particularly in denying an increase in personal injury suits, which undermines its credibility on judicial nominations and other matters.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is negative, as it is grouped with other actions taken by the ABA that the author disapproves of. The mention of affirmative action is brief but is included in a list of issues that the author believes the ABA should not be involved in, suggesting that the author sees the endorsement of affirmative action as part of a ""liberal agenda"" that is outside the appropriate scope of the ABA's activities. The author's focus on the ABA's involvement in this issue implies a belief that the organization should stick to strictly legal matters and avoid taking stands on social policy issues such as affirmative action."	0.027049999999999998	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt	1
	None	The text summary provided does not directly address the topic of affirmative action, instead focusing on the author's views on media bias and the portrayal of liberal views in the media. Since the summary does not contain specific statements or arguments related to affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided text. The author's critique of media bias suggests they desire balanced reporting on social issues, but this does not inherently indicate a position for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the perceived liberal bias in the mainstream media, particularly on the evening newscasts of the big three networks: CBS, NBC, and ABC. The author references Dan Rather's recent media appearances, where Rather has defended himself against accusations of being a left-wing journalist. The author also mentions similar denials of liberal bias by Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw, suggesting that such bias is a figment of conservative imagination. However, the author argues that there is indeed a leftward tilt in the media, as evidenced by polls showing that both Republicans and Democrats perceive a liberal bias among journalists. The author disputes the idea that the anchors are deliberately slanting the news, instead suggesting that they may not even recognize what constitutes liberal bias. The author contends that media bias is more about worldview than party politics and criticizes the media for labeling conservatives but not liberals. The author concludes by challenging the media stars to reconsider their understanding of liberal bias.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly provide a full argument regarding affirmative action, the author's perspective on the issue can be inferred from their broader critique of media bias. The author suggests that the media often presents liberal views on social issues, including affirmative action, as ""reasonable views"" rather than as one side of a debate. This portrayal implies that liberal stances are the default or mainstream positions, which the author criticizes. The author's critique indicates a belief that the media should be more balanced and present contrasting views, including those against affirmative action, with equal seriousness and scrutiny. The author's perspective implies a concern that the media's approach to issues like affirmative action may not adequately represent the diversity of public opinion or the legitimate arguments against such policies."	0.03139	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action, as evidenced by their discussion of the 'social trap,' tokenism, and stigmatization, suggests a nuanced perspective that acknowledges both the potential benefits and the unintended negative consequences of such policies. The emphasis on the importance of informal networks and the idea that companies cannot fully control social integration indicate a belief in a more organic approach to diversity. The author's stance reflects an understanding of the complexities of diversity management and the need to balance fairness to minorities with fairness to others, which suggests a somewhat critical stance toward affirmative action as it is commonly implemented.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges faced by Coca-Cola in light of a racial bias lawsuit and other public relations issues, including a financial downturn and a health scare in Belgium. The author criticizes the media's portrayal of Coke as racist, citing historical evidence of the company's leadership advocating for civil rights and integration. The text also scrutinizes the actions of Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer in the Coke case, and questions the media's skepticism regarding affirmative action and diversity management within corporations. It highlights the complexities of integrating minorities into the workforce and the unintended consequences of affirmative action, such as tokenism and stigmatization.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a critical view of affirmative action, pointing out the ""social trap"" that can result from corporate attempts to implement such policies. The text suggests that while companies have learned to manage diversity as a fact of life, affirmative action can lead to problems like tokenism and can be counterproductive if not handled properly. The author emphasizes the importance of informal networks and personal connections in recruiting and integrating minorities, and suggests that companies cannot fully dictate social integration, as it is something employees must navigate themselves. The author also seems to believe that affirmative action should be managed delicately to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others, indicating a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in diversity management."	0.02937	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical tone when discussing affirmative action, especially in the context of it being a concession amid violent actions by a militant group, indicates a negative view towards the policy. The author's comparison to real-life concessions to terrorists suggests that they view affirmative action as a misguided response that rewards undesirable behavior. This implies that the author may be against affirmative action, at least in the context it is presented in the text.	"Summary:
The text is a hypothetical thriller plot set in a world where a Latino militant group called the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) seeks to reclaim Texas for Mexico. Despite the lack of support from many Latinos, the HRA conducts a violent campaign, including bombings and assassinations, which leads to a peace process and significant concessions from the U.S. government. The HRA members are integrated into Texas's government and law enforcement, and their crimes are effectively pardoned. The author draws a parallel between this fictional scenario and the real-life situation in Northern Ireland, suggesting that the British government has made similar concessions to terrorists, which the author views as a dangerous precedent.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action, as indicated by the sarcastic tone when mentioning that the Latino population in Texas does not mind the affirmative action benefits they receive amid the chaos caused by the HRA. The author implies that affirmative action is a form of appeasement or a reward in response to the disturbance, rather than a principled or fair policy. This perspective is part of a broader critique of what the author perceives as weak and misguided governmental responses to terrorism, both in the fictional scenario and in the real-world context of Northern Ireland. The author's stance suggests a belief that such policies, including affirmative action in this context, undermine democratic principles and reward violent behavior."	0.03057	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author does not provide a personal stance on the issue of affirmative action but instead critiques Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's use of it as a political strategy in a debate. The focus is on the potential political fallout from her approach, such as alienating certain voters, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy. Since the author's analysis is centered on campaign tactics and voter reactions without offering a personal view on affirmative action itself, the author's perspective is best categorized as neutral.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political landscape surrounding Maryland's gubernatorial race, focusing on the Democratic candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and her Republican opponent, Robert Ehrlich. It speculates on how Townsend's fortunes might have been different if Al Gore had chosen her as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election. It critiques Townsend's campaign strategies, including her selection of a running mate and her approach to advertising. The article also contrasts Townsend's background of privilege with Ehrlich's blue-collar upbringing. Further, it examines the role of race in the election, particularly Townsend's use of affirmative action as a debate point against Ehrlich. The piece touches on the potential impact of the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area on voter turnout and the election's outcome. The author, Mr. Smith, is critical of Townsend's campaign and suggests that a low turnout could be detrimental to her political future.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's stance on affirmative action, suggesting that her approach during a debate at Morgan State University might not be effective. Townsend is quoted as linking the necessity of race-based affirmative action to historical racial injustices like slavery, lynching, and Jim Crow laws. The author implies that Townsend's argument, which was made in an environment where her opponent's family was booed, could be seen as demagoguery and might alienate white voters who watched the debate on television. The author does not express a personal opinion on the policy of affirmative action itself but rather comments on the political strategy and its potential consequences in the context of the Maryland gubernatorial race."	0.03168	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is framed within the context of political maneuvering and does not directly address the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policies themselves. Instead, the author is critical of the use of affirmative action as a political tool in the judicial nomination process. The author's main concern appears to be the politicization of the judiciary and the strategy to delay judicial nominees based on their potential opposition to affirmative action, rather than an explicit stance for or against affirmative action policy. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not clearly outlined, and the criticism is more focused on the process and political strategy surrounding it.	"Summary:
The article discusses the investigation into the leak of Democratic strategy memos from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which were published by the Wall Street Journal. These memos revealed the influence of liberal interest groups on Democratic senators regarding the selection of federal judges. The author highlights the lack of media attention given to the content of the memos and criticizes the focus on the leak itself. The memos showed that decisions on judicial nominees were based on political strategy rather than qualifications, citing examples such as the opposition to nominee Miguel Estrada and efforts to influence the outcome of an affirmative action case in the Sixth Circuit. The author also describes the investigation's process and the scrutiny faced by a Republican staffer accused of accessing the memos, which were available to all due to a lack of a firewall on the committee's computer system.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of judicial appointments. The author suggests that the Democratic strategy was to delay judicial nominees who might oppose affirmative action policies, as evidenced by the memo regarding the Sixth Circuit case on the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. The memo indicated a desire to maintain the court's composition to ensure the program's support. The author views this as a politicization of the judiciary, implying that the decision to delay nominees was based on maintaining a political agenda rather than on the nominees' merits."	0.02956	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, and only a brief mention is made regarding affirmative action contracts in the context of political scandals. The perspective is somewhat critical and dismissive, but it is not a primary concern or a deeply explored topic in the text. The author's primary focus is on the political landscape of Chicago and the Daley family's role in it, rather than on affirmative action as a policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political dominance of the Daley family in Chicago, with Richard J. Daley (Daley pere) serving as mayor from 1955 to 1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley (Daley fils), holding the position since 1989. The author mentions that despite occasional scandals and criticisms, including those related to affirmative action contracts, the younger Daley remains popular among Chicagoans. The text highlights the city's transformation under his leadership, including the revitalization of neighborhoods and the creation of Millennium Park. The author acknowledges the history of corruption in Chicago politics but suggests that Daley fils has provided tangible improvements to the city. The article also touches on the Daleys' lack of interest in political positions beyond mayor and suggests that this focus has contributed to their success. The author, Mr. Epstein, concludes by praising Daley fils for his problem-solving approach to governing Chicago.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat critical and dismissive. He references a scandal involving affirmative action contracts in a way that suggests he views such matters as typical political issues in Chicago, equating them to the city's ingrained political corruption. Additionally, the author contrasts Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s criticisms of the younger Daley's administration with the lack of seriousness he attributes to Jesse Jackson Sr.'s political persona, implying skepticism about the sincerity or impact of such criticisms. While the author does not delve deeply into the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policies themselves, his tone suggests a cynical view of how such policies are implemented or leveraged within the context of Chicago politics."	0.03147	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author, Peter Berkowitz, does not address affirmative action in the context of race or gender, but rather in the context of intellectual diversity within academia, specifically political science departments. He is against the idea of using affirmative action as a means to hire conservative scholars or to create courses on conservatism. Berkowitz believes in intellectual diversity and the inclusion of conservative ideas in the curriculum, but he argues that this should be done based on scholarly merit and the value of the ideas themselves, not through affirmative action policies. His stance is that hiring and curriculum decisions should be made without regard to the political identity of the scholars, thus focusing on the quality of scholarship over any form of identity politics.	"Summary:
Peter Berkowitz criticizes the lack of courses on conservatism in the political science departments of major American universities. He argues that this omission lacks intellectual justification and fails to meet the requirements of a liberal education and an objective study of political science. Berkowitz points out that while political science covers various subfields, conservative ideas are rarely taught, especially in the areas of American politics and political theory. He notes that while other political ideologies are regularly explored, conservative thought, from Edmund Burke to modern thinkers like Hayek and Kirk, is largely ignored. Berkowitz asserts that students are thus receiving an incomplete education and suggests that courses on conservatism should be mandatory, not as a form of affirmative action for conservatives, but to enhance intellectual diversity and understanding. He also recommends that political science departments offer courses on the history of progressivism to provide a more balanced view.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Peter Berkowitz is against affirmative action for conservatives in the academic hiring process. He believes that political science departments should not prioritize a professor's political views or lower scholarly standards to include more conservative voices. Instead, Berkowitz advocates for the study and teaching of conservative ideas based on intellectual rigor and knowledge, regardless of the professor's personal political beliefs. He argues that identity should not be more important than expertise when it comes to teaching political ideas. Berkowitz suggests that while hiring more scholars interested in conservative thought might naturally lead to more conservative faculty, the focus should be on ensuring that all political science students are exposed to a wide range of political philosophies, including conservatism, to achieve a well-rounded education."	0.030790000000000005	affirmative action	txt/399053714.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author references historical debates on black progress and cites Thomas Sowell's research to suggest that political success is not a prerequisite for economic advancement. The criticism of Obama's policy stances, such as opposition to school vouchers, indicates a skepticism towards government interventions that are typically associated with affirmative action policies. The text implies that affirmative action may not be effective and could maintain obstacles to progress, showing a critical view of these policies without explicitly discussing affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text explores the potential impact of Barack Obama's presidency on African-American advancement, referencing historical debates between black civic leaders like W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington on the best strategy for black progress. It discusses the increase in black elected officials since the 1960s but acknowledges persistent socioeconomic disparities. The author cites economist Thomas Sowell's research, which suggests that political success is not a prerequisite for economic advancement, as evidenced by various ethnic groups throughout history. The text argues that political success, as might be represented by an Obama presidency, does not guarantee socioeconomic progress for African-Americans. It criticizes Obama's policy stances on minimum wage laws and opposition to school vouchers, suggesting they could hinder black progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Riley, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, appears to hold a critical view of affirmative action and related civil rights legislation. He suggests that significant progress for African-Americans occurred before such policies were implemented and that political activity has not been a key factor in the economic rise of various ethnic groups. He implies that affirmative action and similar political interventions may not be effective in fostering black group advancement and that they could potentially maintain current obstacles to progress. Riley's perspective is informed by the work of Thomas Sowell, who has argued that economic gains often precede political gains for minority groups and that political success is neither necessary nor sufficient for economic advancement."	0.02767	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, criticizes the university's affirmative action policy for leading to an overzealous and hypersensitive environment that can result in unjust outcomes, as exemplified by the case of Keith Sampson. Rabinowitz highlights the absurdity of the situation where Sampson was accused of racial harassment for reading a historical book, suggesting that affirmative action officers acted hastily without proper context. Her perspective indicates a concern that affirmative action, in this form, may stifle free expression and fair treatment, implying a stance that is critical of the way affirmative action is implemented.	"Summary:
The text describes an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) involving a student employee, Keith Sampson, who was accused of racial harassment for reading a book titled ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan"" during his work breaks. Sampson was confronted by his union representative and an assistant affirmative action officer, Marguerite Watkins, who deemed the book inappropriate and akin to Klan propaganda. Despite the book being a historical account available in the university library, Sampson received an official letter from the chief affirmative action officer, Lillian Charleston, stating that his actions constituted racial harassment. After intervention from the ACLU and media attention, the university changed its stance, with Charleston issuing a new letter permitting Sampson to read scholarly materials during break time and reframing the issue as ""conduct"" that caused concern among co-workers, without specifying what that conduct was.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, views the affirmative action policies in place at universities as contributing to a hypersensitive and ideologically charged environment that can lead to absurd outcomes, such as the case against Sampson. Rabinowitz suggests that the affirmative action officers at IUPUI were quick to label Sampson's book reading as racially insensitive without considering the context or content of the book, reflecting a broader issue of overzealousness in addressing race-related matters. She also connects this mindset to the larger political climate, where accusations of racism can be readily deployed against critics, as seen in the 2008 presidential election campaign. The author criticizes the university's handling of the case and the broader implications of such actions, implying that affirmative action, as practiced in this instance, can sometimes undermine rather than support free expression and fair treatment."	0.03735	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's text focuses on the influence of non-profit, tax-exempt foundations on public policy and social programs, rather than on affirmative action specifically. Although affirmative action is mentioned in the context of foundation influence, the author does not express a clear personal stance on affirmative action. The reference to organizations like MALDEF suggests a concern about the accountability of such groups due to their financial dependencies, but this does not directly indicate the author's position on affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the role and influence of non-profit, tax-exempt foundations in the United States. Thirty years ago, some foundations were found to be conduits for CIA subsidies, but the issue faded from public attention. The author notes that the media largely ignores foundations, which have been growing in number and influence, with assets exceeding $200 billion. Foundations are supposed to be apolitical to maintain their tax-exempt status, but many are politically active, often influencing public policy and social programs. The text highlights how conservative foundations have been effective in shaping public discourse and government policy. The reach of foundations extends to controlling organizations like the NAACP through financial power and creating entities like MALDEF, which lacks direct community accountability. The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts have influenced the civic journalism movement. Critics argue that this financial dependency of the press on foundations risks journalistic independence. The author agrees with Nicholas Lemann's view that foundations operate without accountability and should be subject to more public scrutiny and debate regarding their economic and political activities in exchange for their tax-exempt status.

Author’s Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, but it is mentioned in the context of the influence of foundations on public policy and social debates. The text references the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), an organization that has been prominent in debates over immigration and affirmative action. MALDEF, which claims to represent a broad Latino community, receives most of its funding from corporations and foundations, particularly from the Ford Foundation. The author seems to suggest that such organizations may lack genuine accountability to the communities they claim to represent due to their dependency on foundation funding. However, the author does not explicitly state a personal stance on affirmative action itself, focusing instead on the broader issue of the influence of tax-exempt foundations on various social and political issues, including affirmative action."	0.033850000000000005	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective is that while they recognize the complexity of the issue and see merit in both arguments for and against affirmative action, they also seem to favor the idea of a fair society where individual merit is the primary consideration. However, the author acknowledges that racial fairness has not yet been fully achieved and that there may be a need for measures to address historical disadvantages. The author's nuanced view suggests they believe in the goal of a colorblind society but are also aware of the practical challenges in achieving it. They are neither fully for nor against affirmative action; instead, they advocate for a balanced approach that strives for fairness and acknowledges the current societal imperfections.	"Summary:
The text discusses the contentious issue of affirmative action in the context of recent events, such as the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the debate over Bill Lann Lee's nomination. The author observes that both sides of the argument fail to fully acknowledge the validity of the other's points. One side believes racial discrimination is a relic of the past, while the other insists that opposition to affirmative action is inherently racist and that racial fairness has yet to be achieved in many sectors. The author suggests that the truth is complex and that society often oversimplifies debates, drawing stark lines and forcing a choice between incomplete realities. The text also references the case of Louise Woodward to illustrate the pitfalls of reducing complex issues to black-and-white choices. The author believes most Americans desire fairness and are uncomfortable with the consequences of policies like Proposition 209, which have led to a significant drop in African American admissions at prestigious institutions. The author concludes by questioning what exactly is being fought over, suggesting that the real debate is about the best method to achieve a society where individual merit outweighs racial background, citing the increasing number of black quarterbacks in the NFL as a positive sign of progress.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They recognize the complexity of the issue and the partial truths on both sides of the debate. They acknowledge that while blatant segregation and discrimination have largely been outlawed and public opinion is against racism, racial fairness is still not a reality in all aspects of society. The author seems to believe that most Americans, including affirmative action supporters, do not wish to distribute societal benefits solely based on race but rather seek a fair society where individual attributes such as talent and character are paramount. The author suggests that the debate should not be about whether we want a colorblind society, but rather about how to achieve it, indicating that there may be a need for measures to level the playing field before implementing a uniform set of rules that do not account for historical disadvantages. The increase in black quarterbacks in the NFL is seen as a sign that, with the right opportunities, racial barriers can be overcome."	0.03218	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's recounting of personal experiences with racism and the acknowledgment of progress in racial equality, coupled with the concern over decreased minority enrollment due to the absence of affirmative action, suggests a stance that is supportive of affirmative action. The author's emphasis on the importance of recognizing the worth of all people and the advocacy for a national conversation about race further indicate a perspective that sees affirmative action as a means to foster equality and dignity for all individuals. The mention of the author's role as the secretary of transportation adds credibility to their views on social policy, but does not directly influence the determination of their stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, by nine African American students 40 years prior to the writing of the article. It describes the author's personal experiences with racism and the struggle for civil rights, including a sit-in protest at his school that led to a confrontation with the authorities. The author acknowledges progress in racial equality but points out that racism still exists in more subtle forms and that there are ongoing issues like the decrease in minority enrollment when affirmative action is removed. The text highlights the changing demographics of America and the need for a national conversation about race. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the worth of all people and the dignity of every individual to build a society that honors differences. The author, who is the secretary of transportation, concludes by stating that while laws can change institutions, they cannot change what is in people's hearts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a necessary measure to ensure equal opportunities for minorities. They express concern over the consequences of lifting affirmative action rules, as evidenced by the plummeting minority enrollment at state universities. This indicates that the author believes affirmative action plays a critical role in providing access to education for minority groups. The author seems to support the idea that affirmative action is a tool to combat subtle, insidious forms of racism and to promote a more equitable society."	0.02625	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective acknowledges the complexity of admissions systems and the role of race-conscious admissions in fostering diversity, which suggests a level of support for affirmative action. They reference the Bakke decision, which allows race to be a factor in admissions, and criticize the Hopwood v. Texas decision for challenging affirmative action without Supreme Court review. However, the author does not express an unqualified endorsement of affirmative action, instead advocating for a 'nuanced application' that aligns with legal standards. This indicates that the author is in favor of affirmative action but with careful consideration of its implementation and legal boundaries.	"Summary:
Jennifer Gratz filed a lawsuit against the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, arguing that she was discriminated against because she is white. Her case could lead to the dismantling of the university's affirmative action program if she wins in the lower courts. If she loses, opponents of affirmative action could challenge such admissions processes before the Supreme Court, which is currently not very supportive of affirmative action. The University of Michigan had admissions guidelines that treated minority applications differently, which could be a constitutional issue based on the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke decision, which allows race to be a factor but not to exclude any candidate from full consideration. The university has since changed its admissions system. The article also notes that it's difficult to prove that a student was rejected solely because of race and that other preferences exist in admissions, such as for local students or alumni children. It questions whether Bakke still stands as law, especially after a decision by the Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v. Texas, which ruled against the use of race in admissions for the University of Texas Law School. The Supreme Court declined to review the case, leaving uncertainty about the future of affirmative action in education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be cautiously supportive, recognizing the complexity of admissions systems and the various factors that influence decisions. They acknowledge that race-conscious admissions could lead to individual cases where white applicants like Gratz feel discriminated against but argue that this alone doesn't necessarily make a program unconstitutional. The author criticizes the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas for preempting the Supreme Court on an important constitutional question and suggests that affirmative action, when used under narrow circumstances to foster diversity, still appears to be a constitutional approach in the unique environment of public universities. Overall, the author seems to advocate for a nuanced application of affirmative action that aligns with the Bakke decision and supports diversity in higher education while also recognizing the legal and constitutional challenges such programs face."	0.02871	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action within the provided text. Instead, the focus is on the potential conflict between domestic policies, such as affirmative action, and international trade agreements like the MAI. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central topic of the text, and no explicit support or opposition to affirmative action is expressed. Rather, the author highlights the importance of considering domestic policies during international negotiations, which indicates an awareness of the policy's significance but does not reveal a personal viewpoint on the matter.	"Summary:
Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland legislator, proposed sanctions against companies operating in Nigeria due to human rights abuses. This led to State Department officials lobbying against the proposal, as foreign policy is increasingly conflicting with local initiatives in the U.S. The U.S. is more dependent on international trade and investment than ever, with imports and exports now constituting 30% of GDP. Trade negotiations have evolved from focusing on tariffs to addressing ""non-tariff barriers"" such as foreign laws that potentially disadvantage U.S. products. Other countries, in turn, have expectations of how the U.S. should regulate itself, and international treaties can impact domestic laws. The Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI) is a treaty under negotiation that would standardize treatment for foreign companies, which has raised concerns about its potential impact on domestic policies like affirmative action. U.S. officials claim that current laws would be protected under the MAI, but there is skepticism and opposition from various groups. The Clinton administration is proceeding cautiously with the MAI negotiations, learning from past experiences that they need to engage in broader consultations with stakeholders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state a personal perspective on affirmative action. However, the text mentions affirmative action in the context of potential conflicts between domestic policies and international agreements like the MAI. The author lists affirmative action among other policies that could be challenged under the treaty's provisions, suggesting that it is a significant aspect of domestic policy that could be affected by international trade agreements. The inclusion of affirmative action in this list implies that the author recognizes it as an important policy that could be at risk of being undermined by the MAI, indicating an understanding of its relevance and the potential consequences of international treaties on such domestic regulations."	0.031229999999999997	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of the report 'Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education' shows a recognition of the progress made by African Americans in higher education, as well as an acknowledgment of the ongoing challenges they face. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated; however, the positive reception of the report's findings and the emphasis on the need for continued improvement suggest a supportive stance towards measures that promote educational advancement for African Americans. The focus on data and evidence-based approaches to understanding racial disparities, along with the mention of gender disparity, indicates a nuanced view that values both the achievements and the need for further action to address inequalities, which is in line with the principles of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education,"" which highlights the advancements African Americans have made in higher education over a 20-year period. The report, prepared by the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute for the United Negro College Fund, shows significant increases in African American enrollment and graduation rates across various types of institutions and regions, with the South leading. The author of the report, Michael T. Nettles, acknowledges the progress but also points out areas that need improvement, such as the lower college enrollment and graduation rates of African Americans compared to their representation in the college-age cohort, the lower graduation rates compared to whites, and the underrepresentation of African Americans in faculty positions. Nettles also notes the gender disparity among African American undergraduates, with women significantly outnumbering men.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly state the author's perspective on affirmative action, it suggests a nuanced view that acknowledges both the progress made by African Americans in higher education and the ongoing challenges they face. The author appears to be supportive of efforts to promote educational advancement for African Americans, as indicated by the positive reaction to the report's findings and the recognition of the need for continued progress. The focus on data and trends suggests an appreciation for evidence-based approaches to understanding and addressing racial disparities in education. The mention of the gender disparity among African American undergraduates, particularly the underrepresentation of men, implies an awareness of the complexity of issues related to race and gender in education, which could be relevant to discussions about affirmative action policies. Overall, the author seems to believe in the importance of recognizing and building upon successes while also working to address persistent inequalities."	0.02956	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of affirmative action, describing it as part of a 'racial spoils system' and suggesting that it exacerbates racial divisions rather than helping to overcome them. The author believes that affirmative action and similar policies are obstacles to achieving racial harmony and suggests that honest differences of opinion, rather than moral inadequacies, are the reason for the failure to achieve racial honesty in America. This criticism indicates a stance that is against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text criticizes both Al Gore and Bill Bradley, highlighting their shortcomings and questioning their perspectives on various issues. Gore is depicted as having made strange claims and holding positions that lack support even among senators. His certitude is described as having an undercurrent of moral superiority. Bradley, on the other hand, is portrayed as sanctimonious and overly focused on race. His speech at Cooper Union is characterized as earnest but not novel, and his past actions are cited as examples of his tendency to moralize and accuse others of racial insensitivity. The author also criticizes identity politics and suggests that Democratic policies like affirmative action may hinder rather than help racial harmony.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They suggest that Bill Bradley's approach to racial issues, which includes a focus on affirmative action, does not actually contribute to overcoming divisions but rather exacerbates them. The author views affirmative action as part of a ""racial spoils system"" and implies that it is part of an obsession with race that is counterproductive. They argue that such policies, along with categorical representation, may be obstacles to reaching a time when race exists but does not matter, quoting Toni Morrison. The author believes that the goal of racial harmony is made more difficult by these policies and that the failure to achieve racial honesty in America is not due to moral inadequacies but rather to honest differences of opinion among decent people."	0.0264	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, and the author does not provide a clear personal stance on the issue. Instead, the author discusses how President Clinton handled affirmative action as part of a broader examination of the political climate and strategies of the time. The brief mention of Clinton's 'mend it, don't end it' policy on affirmative action is used to illustrate Clinton's centrist and strategic approach to governance, rather than to express the author's own views on the policy. As such, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's stance toward affirmative action.	"Summary:
John Harris, in his article, discusses the changing political landscape in the United States during the Clinton era, highlighting the decline of populism and the rise of elite influence in politics. He notes that the personal controversies surrounding Clinton and the antagonism he faced have overshadowed a significant shift in American politics, where establishment institutions and values have gained acceptance among the populace. Harris observes that movements both liberal and conservative have historically drawn strength from populist grievances, but during Clinton's presidency, there has been a decline in the energy of these movements. He cites examples such as the fading potency of tax cuts as a political issue and the increased tolerance for issues like gun control and foreign intervention, which have traditionally been elite concerns.

Harris points out that Clinton, who initially ran as a populist, has paradoxically contributed to making politics more hospitable for the educated and professional class. He argues that the booming economy, reductions in crime, and other successes have helped shift public opinion in favor of the elites. Clinton's political strategies, such as co-opting Republican issues and using polling to finely tune policy positions, have also played a role in this shift. The author concludes by suggesting that whether Al Gore or George W. Bush wins the presidency, the era is moving away from populist politics towards a period dominated by centrist and elite-driven policy-making.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author touches on affirmative action briefly, using it as an example of how Clinton has managed to navigate contentious issues. He describes Clinton's approach to affirmative action with the phrase ""mend it, don't end it,"" which indicates an attempt to reform the policy without completely abolishing it. This stance is portrayed as a calculated middle ground, designed to appeal to the majority and defuse populist fervor. The author's mention of affirmative action within the context of Clinton's political maneuvering suggests that he sees it as another area where elite consensus is shaping policy, rather than populist sentiment driving change. Harris appears to view affirmative action through the lens of political strategy rather than as a moral or ideological issue, focusing on how it has been used by politicians to maintain support and manage public opinion."	0.042870000000000005	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical reference to the conservative viewpoint on affirmative action as 'Satan's own tool' suggests a disagreement with the negative connotation associated with affirmative action by conservatives. The author's contemplation on whether white conservatives can support black candidates based on shared philosophy rather than race, and the suggestion that doing so is a positive step, indicates a belief in the importance of looking beyond race. This perspective aligns with the principles of affirmative action, which seeks to address racial disparities and promote equality. The author's stance is not explicitly stated, but the critique of the conservative position and the positive view on race-transcending political support imply a favorable view of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a contemplation on the dynamics of race and politics, particularly in the context of white conservative voters' response to Alan Keyes, an African American presidential candidate. The author reflects on whether white voters can look beyond a black candidate's race, noting that while white voters believe they can and have done so, black Americans remain skeptical, often attributing such votes to racial guilt. The author cites examples of black politicians who have been elected with white support and questions whether white conservatives can truly disregard race or if they only support black candidates whose views align with their own conservative beliefs, which may be at odds with the majority of black voters. The author also ponders the possibility of white conservatives moving beyond race to consider a candidate's character and philosophy, suggesting that this might offer hope for racial understanding among white liberals as well.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of the conservative viewpoint on affirmative action, describing it as ""Satan's own tool"" from the perspective of dyed-in-the-wool conservatives. This phrasing implies the author disagrees with the conservative characterization of affirmative action as something negative. Additionally, the author challenges the notion that white conservatives can only support African American candidates who share their disdain for affirmative action and other government initiatives. The author appears to advocate for a more nuanced understanding of race relations and suggests that the ability of conservatives to support black candidates based on shared philosophy, rather than race, is a positive development that should be acknowledged and potentially celebrated."	0.0265	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	1
	None	The author of the text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action itself but discusses the importance of transparency in potential presidential appointees in the context of how it might affect affirmative action policies. The concern is that the influence of the Democratic Leadership Council might lead to a rollback in affirmative action. The author's focus on the importance of knowing appointees to assess their stance on diversity and inclusiveness suggests that they believe affirmative action to be a significant policy issue. However, the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's personal stance on affirmative action as strongly or somewhat in favor, neutral, or against. Instead, the author is concerned with the implications of potential appointees' stances on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the importance of knowing the potential presidential appointees before the election. It emphasizes that the individuals who fill the roles of Cabinet members, White House advisers, and other influential positions will be instrumental in shaping the administration's priorities and policies. The author notes that aside from a few names like Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice for George W. Bush's potential team, the public is largely unaware of who the candidates would select for their administrations. The piece argues that voters deserve to know who will be entrusted with government roles before Election Day, highlighting that this information is crucial for assessing how inclusive and diverse a candidate's team will be, and whether it will reflect the promises made during the campaign. The author also touches on the shift within the Democratic Party, with the Democratic Leadership Council gaining influence, raising questions about the potential impact on affirmative action and other policies. The article concludes by calling for the presidential candidates to disclose their potential Cabinet picks by mid-October, rather than keeping voters in suspense until after the election.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses concern about the future of affirmative action and other policies aimed at supporting diversity and equal opportunity. The text suggests that voters, especially African Americans and other voters of color, might be worried about the possibility of a rollback in affirmative action under a new administration, particularly if the Democratic Leadership Council, which is seen as center-right, has a significant influence on Al Gore's potential appointments. The author implies that early disclosure of a candidate's appointees could reassure voters about the candidate's commitment to maintaining or advancing affirmative action and related policies. The perspective conveyed is that transparency in the selection of top-level officials before the election could provide voters with a clearer understanding of how each candidate's administration would address issues of diversity and inclusion."	0.03357	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author acknowledges Senator Lieberman's historical willingness to question affirmative action, indicating an appreciation for nuanced views on the subject. However, the author also notes that Lieberman's speech aligns with the Democratic Party's endorsement of affirmative action without addressing any previous concerns, implying a strategic political move rather than a deep-seated belief. The author's recognition of the importance of openness to new ideas and challenging traditional positions suggests a preference for a more critical and thoughtful approach to affirmative action. The author does not express a clear personal stance for or against affirmative action, but rather comments on Lieberman's positioning and the Democratic Party's approach to the issue.	"Summary:
Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the American public as a man with a classic American story, emphasizing his family's values and the universality of the American dream. While his Jewish heritage has been highlighted, his speech focused on shared American values. Despite his reputation for integrity and innovative thinking, Lieberman has faced tensions for his criticism of Clinton-Gore fundraising and President Clinton's ethical issues, as well as for questioning policies dear to the Democratic Party's liberal wing. The Bush campaign has even suggested Lieberman is closer to Republican views.

In his speech, Lieberman aligned himself with mainstream Democratic positions, supporting civil rights, fair distribution of prosperity, and key issues like health care and environmental protection. He avoided discussing past criticisms of Clinton, fundraising issues, and controversial topics like tort reform and school vouchers, which conflict with major Democratic donors and constituencies. Instead, he focused on common ground with Al Gore, especially on issues like the fight against indecency in popular culture.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author notes that Senator Lieberman has previously shown a willingness to acknowledge the complexities of affirmative action and has questioned the policy in the past. However, in his speech, Lieberman endorsed affirmative action without addressing his earlier concerns, suggesting a strategic alignment with the Democratic Party's stance. The author seems to indicate that while Lieberman's past positions included a nuanced view on affirmative action, his current endorsement may gloss over these complexities to maintain unity with the party's platform and appeal to its core constituents. The author appears to appreciate Lieberman's past willingness to engage with the complexities of such issues and seems to suggest that the Democratic Party would benefit from preserving openness to new ideas and a willingness to challenge traditional positions."	0.027880000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on John Ashcroft's nomination for attorney general and his past actions, including opposing Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to his support for affirmative action. The author questions the consistency of applying ideological scrutiny to nominees, suggesting that Ashcroft's views could similarly affect his policy decisions. However, the summary does not include specific statements that reveal the author's stance on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the nomination of John Ashcroft for the position of attorney general and the concerns surrounding his potential influence on law enforcement policy. While Ashcroft's supporters claim he is qualified and would enforce the law fairly, the author argues that this assurance is insufficient because the attorney general has significant discretion in setting enforcement priorities. The author references Ashcroft's conservative record on issues such as gun control, abortion, juvenile justice, and the death penalty, suggesting that his ideological views could shape his approach to law enforcement policy. The text also mentions Ashcroft's past opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil rights division based on Lee's beliefs on affirmative action, implying that similar reasoning could be applied to Ashcroft's nomination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author references the nomination of Bill Lann Lee, who was known for supporting affirmative action, and John Ashcroft's opposition to Lee's nomination based on those beliefs. The author questions why the same standard used by Ashcroft to assess Lee's suitability for the civil rights division role—whether personal beliefs would affect one's judgment—should not also apply to Ashcroft's own nomination for attorney general. This suggests that the author believes personal and ideological views, such as those on affirmative action, are relevant to the evaluation of a nominee's fitness for a role that involves setting legal and enforcement policies."	0.02481	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's mention of affirmative action is purely statistical and lacks any explicit judgment or evaluation of its merits or drawbacks. The presentation of data on the Bush administration's appointments of women and minorities is factual and does not contain any language that suggests the author's personal stance. The comparison with previous administrations serves to contextualize the information rather than to argue for or against affirmative action. Therefore, the author's perspective is best categorized as neutral, given the absence of any discernible opinion or advocacy in the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the backlash faced by the Bush administration for retracting a Clinton-era regulation that aimed to reduce arsenic levels in drinking water. Jonathan Adler, a former senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, criticized the administration's handling of the issue, blaming poor communication and the incompetence of environmental journalists. Adler suggested that the administration should have emphasized the lack of industry beneficiaries from rescinding the regulation and the existence of a federal arsenic standard. Environmentalists, like Elliott Negin of the Natural Resources Defense Council, argue that the facts did not support the Bush administration's stance. The text also humorously suggests renaming arsenic to something less alarming to the public.

The text briefly mentions a fundraiser for Senator Maria Cantwell, the appointment of Charles A. Heimbold Jr. as ambassador to Sweden, and the potential candidates for other ambassadorial roles. It ends with a note on the Bush administration's record of appointing women and minorities to top-tier positions, comparing the statistics to those of previous administrations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to take a neutral stance toward affirmative action, simply presenting the data on the Bush administration's appointments of women and minorities to top positions without expressing a personal opinion. The data shows that 40 percent of Bush's announcements for positions requiring Senate confirmation have been women and minorities. This is contrasted with the percentages from the Clinton and Reagan administrations. The author reports these figures and allows readers to draw their own conclusions about the effectiveness or fairness of the Bush administration's approach to diversity in appointments, without advocating for or against affirmative action policies."	0.026640000000000004	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt	1
	None	The author, Michael Kinsley, is critical of conservatives' selective adherence to their professed judicial philosophies, particularly in the context of affirmative action. He notes that while conservatives claim to support judicial restraint and the Constitution's original intent, they are willing to embrace judicial activism to oppose affirmative action. Kinsley's criticism of this inconsistency implies that he does not align with the conservative viewpoint on affirmative action, which he views as opportunistic. However, his own stance on affirmative action itself is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the text does not provide enough information to categorize Kinsley's personal stance on affirmative action, as the focus is on critiquing the conservative approach rather than directly discussing the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
Michael Kinsley, in his article, criticizes the conservative approach to interpreting the Constitution, particularly regarding the phrase ""advice and consent"" in the context of judicial nominations. He argues that conservatives strictly adhere to the Constitution's original intent except when it is inconvenient for them, such as when interpreting ""advice and consent."" Kinsley suggests that conservatives impose additional limitations on the Senate's power to consent to judicial nominees, especially when the President and Senate are from opposing parties. He also points out that conservatives often overlook their judicial philosophy of ""judicial restraint,"" ""strict construction,"" and ""original intent"" when it suits their goals, such as in the case of affirmative action. Kinsley contends that the Senate has the right to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to ask them about specific legal issues. He also criticizes the conservative claim that there was no obstruction of President Clinton's nominees, contrasting it with their treatment of Clinton's nominee Bill Lann Lee. Kinsley concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy of conservatives like Clint Bolick, who argue against considering philosophical differences in judicial confirmations while actively opposing nominees who disagree with their views.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Michael Kinsley, appears to be critical of conservatives' stance on affirmative action. He points out that conservatives, who typically promote judicial restraint and adherence to the Constitution's original intent, are willing to support judicial activism when it comes to overturning affirmative action policies enacted by elected branches of government. Kinsley implies that conservatives' judicial philosophy is selectively applied and not a consistent guide to interpreting the Constitution. He uses the example of conservatives wanting judges to use the Constitution to overturn affirmative action as evidence of their inconsistent application of their own principles. This suggests that Kinsley views the conservative perspective on affirmative action as opportunistic and not grounded in a faithful application of their stated judicial philosophy."	0.03396	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly expressed as a personal opinion. Instead, the author discusses affirmative action in the context of President Clinton's political strategy, recognizing it as a nonnegotiable core issue for Clinton's supporters. The author seems to understand the importance of affirmative action in political maneuvering but does not offer a personal stance on the policy itself. Therefore, based on the information provided, the author's personal stance on affirmative action cannot be determined, and they should be categorized as neutral since they are discussing it from a strategic standpoint rather than expressing support or opposition.	"Summary:
The text discusses public opinion of President George W. Bush, suggesting several reasons for his popularity, including low expectations, a less impressive predecessor, a charming personality, and a focused administration. The author initially concedes to having underestimated Bush's intelligence, particularly due to his lack of verbal skills, which led many, including the author, to mistakenly consider him unintelligent.

The author argues that Bush possesses a different kind of intelligence—political intelligence—which involves understanding and manipulating people and situations. This intelligence is likened to the political strategy of ""triangulation"" used by former President Bill Clinton. Triangulation involves satisfying a political core's nonnegotiable demands, neutralizing opposition, and appealing to swing voters. Bush is credited with satisfying his core's demands on issues like abortion and taxes, while also appealing to swing voters through policies like opposing racial profiling, which is not a core issue but resonates with the swing voters and undermines the opposition's portrayal of him as racially insensitive.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as one of the nonnegotiable demands of President Clinton's core supporters. Clinton is praised for unwaveringly championing this core issue, along with others like unfettered abortion rights and identity group representation. The author suggests that Clinton's strategic support for these nonnegotiable core issues granted him leeway on other matters and helped him to win over swing voters by shedding unpopular positions that had previously marginalized Democrats. This indicates that the author recognizes affirmative action as a key policy in the political strategy of securing a core voter base while also appealing to a broader electorate."	0.02765	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective, as inferred from the summary, appears to be critical of affirmative action, especially within the context of academia. The article suggests that affirmative action may contribute to a lack of ideological diversity, as it is presented as part of a system that favors certain political orientations and potentially excludes those with differing viewpoints. The reference to Bauerlein's view that opposition to affirmative action could preclude someone from pursuing a degree in a particular field reinforces the notion that the author is critical of how affirmative action is implemented in academic settings. However, the summary does not provide explicit statements of the author's own views on the policy's broader societal implications, so the stance appears to be critical but not strongly against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article from The New York Times discusses the dominance of liberal ideology among academia in the United States. Studies have shown that Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans among professors, especially in the humanities and social sciences, and this imbalance is growing as younger, more uniformly liberal professors replace the older, retiring ones. Voter registration records from various universities confirm the liberal dominance, with institutions like Berkeley, Stanford, Cornell, and UCLA showing a significant liberal majority among their faculty members. Despite this, some academics, like George Lakoff, argue that the disparity is due to conservatives' lack of interest in academic careers, not institutional bias. Mark Bauerlein, in a Chronicle of Higher Education essay, suggests that academia's culture inherently excludes conservatives due to its embedded political orientations within scholarship definitions. This creates a ""false consensus effect"" and ""the law of group polarization,"" leading to extreme views and a lack of awareness of how these views are perceived outside their circle.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action within academia, suggesting that it is one example of how political orientations are embedded in academic fields. Bauerlein's view, as presented in the article, is that those who disagree with affirmative action might as well not pursue a degree in African-American studies, implying that affirmative action and related policies are gatekeepers for academic and ideological conformity. The author's inclusion of this viewpoint indicates a belief that affirmative action is part of a broader exclusionary practice that limits diversity of thought in academic institutions."	0.02802	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt	1
	None	The summary provided does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action. The author discusses Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's ideological shift and its impact on the Supreme Court's decision regarding affirmative action, but this is presented as part of a broader discussion about the court's transparency and the role of justices' personal ideologies in court decisions. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not clear from the summary, thus it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on the issue.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court has disclosed that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is diagnosed with thyroid cancer, leading to discussions about how much health information the court should release to the public. Historically, the court has been discreet about justices' personal lives, but given the court's significant role in policymaking, some argue that more transparency is needed. While some experts believe there is a public right to know about the chief justice's health, others defend the court's privacy, citing constitutional differences between the judiciary and other government branches. Additionally, the text mentions a study confirming Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role as the court's ""median voter,"" with her ideological leanings having shifted leftwards over time, influencing the court's decisions, including its 2003 approval of affirmative action in college admissions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents the perspective that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's ideological shift to the left has been instrumental in the Supreme Court's decisions, particularly regarding affirmative action. The study mentioned in the text suggests that O'Connor's evolving views were crucial in the court's 5-4 vote to uphold affirmative action in college admissions in 2003, with O'Connor herself writing the majority opinion. The implication is that without O'Connor's leftward movement, the court might not have approved affirmative action. The author's perspective seems to acknowledge the significant impact that individual justices, particularly those in a swing position like O'Connor, can have on shaping the court's rulings on contentious issues such as affirmative action."	0.025500000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly address their personal stance on affirmative action in the provided text. The discussion centers on the political attacks on judges and the judiciary's role in resolving controversial issues. Although the author mentions the Rehnquist court's rulings on issues like affirmative action, it is in the context of defending the judiciary against accusations of elitism and not as a commentary on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the subject of the text, and no clear stance is articulated.	"Summary:
The text discusses the increasing threats and political attacks against judges in the United States, particularly in light of high-profile cases such as that of Terri Schiavo. The author argues that the judiciary has become a target for personal attacks due to the ""legalization of politics,"" where judges are asked to resolve controversial issues that politics cannot. The Schiavo case exemplifies the trend of politicians and litigants attacking judges when they disagree with their decisions. The author notes the historical attempts by Congress to curb judicial independence and criticizes the current wave of judge-bashing from both liberals and conservatives. The author refutes the perception of judges as anti-democratic elitists by citing that, in many cases, their decisions align with the views of the majority of Americans. Interest groups are identified as a major force behind the politicization of judicial nominations. The author advises judges to follow the law, avoid grandiose assertions of judicial supremacy, and stay out of the spotlight to maintain their independence and resist personalization.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. However, the author references a book by Mark Tushnet, ""A Court Divided,"" which suggests that the Rehnquist court's rulings on controversial issues, including affirmative action, generally supported the views of a narrow majority of Americans. This indicates that, at least in the context of the Rehnquist court, the author perceives the judiciary as reflecting the constitutional views of national majorities rather than acting as anti-democratic elitists. The mention of affirmative action in this context is used to argue against the accusations that judges are thwarting democratic processes, rather than to express a specific stance on the policy itself."	0.036090000000000004	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not a primary focus of the text but is mentioned in the context of Tel Aviv's inclusive and tolerant practices. The brief mention of affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs indicates an acknowledgment of the city's efforts toward diversity and equality. However, the author does not offer a critique or deep analysis of these policies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a clear stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text provides a narrative tour of Tel Aviv, exploring its historical roots in the ancient port of Jaffa and its evolution into a modern metropolis. The city is described as a blend of cultures and lifestyles, with a strong bohemian streak, and is seen by some as the fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's Zionist vision. Tel Aviv is characterized as a cultural and financial hub, distinct from other Israeli cities due to its secular, liberal, and pluralistic nature. The city's architecture, particularly its Bauhaus heritage, is highlighted, along with the challenges of preserving these buildings amid rising property values. The article touches on the city's diverse population, including its Arab citizens and the affirmative action policies in place for hiring Israeli Arabs. The narrative also delves into the personal lives of Tel Aviv residents, illustrating the city's openness to different lifestyles and its vibrant nightlife that continues without a last call.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides a brief mention of affirmative action in the context of Tel Aviv's efforts to be inclusive and tolerant. The city council chairman, Yael Dayan, acknowledges the existence of affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs, suggesting a commitment to ensuring diversity and equality in the city's workforce. However, the author does not delve deeply into the effectiveness or the community's reception of these policies. The perspective presented is one of acknowledgment rather than critique or analysis, and it is mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the city's inclusive values and liberal policies."	0.03028	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to be neutral regarding their personal stance on affirmative action. They provide a balanced view by acknowledging both skepticism about the Christian Coalition's motives, given their historical opposition to affirmative action, and optimism about the potential for positive change through the Samaritan Project. The author's focus is on the Christian Coalition's actions and the possible outcomes rather than on advocating for or against affirmative action policies. The neutrality is indicated by the absence of a clear endorsement or criticism of affirmative action as a policy, instead discussing the complexities of the Christian Coalition's relationship with African-American communities.	"The text discusses the potential for Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, to bridge the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. Reed, who has historically opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on issues like affirmative action and welfare reform, has called on white Christian conservatives to acknowledge their historical role in slavery and segregation. To address social injustices, the Christian Coalition launched the Samaritan Project, a multiracial initiative aimed at revitalizing low-income, inner-city neighborhoods and fostering partnerships with local churches, especially those aiding at-risk youths.

The author presents a perspective that acknowledges skepticism about the Christian Coalition's motives, given their opposition to affirmative action and other civil rights issues. However, the author also expresses a level of optimism about the potential for positive change. The Samaritan Project is seen as an opportunity for white churches to actively support black communities, particularly through the rebuilding of black churches affected by arson. The author notes that African-American church leaders have been receptive to the initiative.

Regarding affirmative action, the author does not explicitly state their personal stance but does highlight that the Christian Coalition, and by extension Reed, have been opponents of such policies. The text suggests that the Christian Coalition's engagement with African-American communities through the Samaritan Project could be an attempt to gain moral and political clout, possibly in exchange for support on conservative policies like school vouchers and tax incentives for charitable donations.

Overall, the author seems cautiously hopeful about the Christian Coalition's outreach efforts while remaining aware of the potential political motivations behind them. The author concludes by expressing a desire to see a more racially inclusive political landscape and a leading role for churches in promoting racial reconciliation."	0.02768	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author shows a recognition of the complexities and controversies surrounding affirmative action, but still expresses a measured endorsement of the mayor's plan to promote diversity in the police force. The acknowledgment of the importance of diversity and job performance as a criterion for promotions, despite the potential for cronyism or insult, indicates that the author sees value in affirmative action policies when they are aimed at creating a representative and effective public service. The author's critique of the opposition from the police union and the African-American Police League further underscores a belief in the merit of the mayor's initiative.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of diversity in the Chicago police force and Mayor Richard Daley's strategy to address it. The mayor proposed that promotions to the rank of sergeant would not be based solely on written test results, which previously favored non-Hispanic whites. Instead, 70% of promotions would be based on test results, and 30% on job performance, with the latter presumably promoting racial and ethnic balance. This approach has faced criticism from both the police union, which accuses the mayor of cronyism, and the African-American Police League, which feels insulted by the implication that special measures are needed for black officers to qualify. The text argues that job performance is an important criterion for promotion and that the mayor's plan, while not perfect, should be supported as it aims to create a police force that reflects the city's diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be cautiously supportive. The author acknowledges the need for a diverse police force in a city like Chicago and seems to agree with the mayor's intention to use job performance as a factor in promotions to achieve this diversity. The author is critical of the police union's immediate dismissal of the plan as cronyism and the African-American Police League's rejection of the idea that special measures are necessary for minority officers to advance. The text suggests that while affirmative action can be controversial, it is sometimes necessary to ensure that institutions like the police force effectively serve and represent the communities they protect. The author also recognizes the potential for the plan to be abused but believes that the mayor's strategy is worth supporting as a step towards a more representative and capable police force."	0.024439999999999996	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The authors present a nuanced critique of the outcomes of affirmative action, particularly in the realm of education. They highlight the failure of affirmative action policies to achieve their intended goals by pointing out the stark example of only one black student being admitted to UC Berkeley's law school after the ban on affirmative action. They discuss the broader implications of inequality and social separation, suggesting that while the civil rights movement sought to combat separateness to achieve equality, the current situation shows that inequality can also reinforce separateness. Their perspective does not outright reject the principles of affirmative action but instead expresses concern about its effectiveness and the negative consequences of rolling back such policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the memorial service of Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, which was attended by a host of prominent figures, contrasting sharply with the sparsely attended funeral of her husband in 1965. Shabazz is remembered for her dignified life and civil rights advocacy after being widowed with six daughters. The article connects her passing with ongoing discussions in the black community about integration and the legacy of Malcolm X, suggesting a tension between the desire for greater roles in society and the reality of persistent inequality and family troubles within the black underclass.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, imply a critical stance on the outcome of affirmative action policies, particularly in education. They reference the recent ban on affirmative action at the University of California and its immediate impact: only one black student being admitted to the incoming class at UC Berkeley's law school. This outcome is used to underscore a broader point about the relationship between inequality and social separateness. While the civil rights era fought against the notion that separateness led to inequality, Gates Jr. and Hertzberg argue that the current situation demonstrates how inequality reinforces separateness. The authors seem to suggest that the goals of affirmative action—to create more integrated and equal opportunities—are not being met, and the rollback of such policies may exacerbate the issues of inequality and lack of diversity in higher education."	0.0234	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's arguments suggest a critical stance towards affirmative action, particularly in its use of racial preferences in university admissions. By emphasizing the need for improved academic preparation for minority students and critiquing the elimination of standardized tests like the SAT, the author indicates a belief that affirmative action policies may not effectively address the root causes of educational inequality. The concern about placing students in environments for which they are underprepared, and the potential for high dropout rates, further underscores the author's skepticism about the efficacy of affirmative action without foundational educational reforms.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of affirmative action in university admissions, specifically at the University of California system. The Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California is concerned that the elimination of racial preferences and the reliance on academic records and test scores, such as the SAT, will lead to a decrease in Latino student enrollment. Instead of seeking to improve Hispanic students' performance, the task force suggests eliminating the SAT. Critics argue that the SAT is culturally biased, correlates more with family income than academic ability, and doesn't predict college performance. However, the author refutes these claims by pointing out that Asian-Americans outperform other groups on the SAT, including whites, and that high-income black students score similarly to low-income whites. The author suggests that the SAT is necessary because it provides a standard measure to compare students from different schools and that grade inflation would become a more significant issue without it. The text argues that the root of the problem is the inadequate academic preparation provided to black and Hispanic students in elementary and secondary schools, not the SAT. The author warns that lowering standards to increase minority enrollment could lead to higher dropout rates, as seen with African-American students. The solution proposed is to improve grade schools and high schools to prepare students better for college.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and suggests that affirmative action policies, which rely on racial preferences, may not be addressing the actual issue of educational inequality. The author believes that the focus should be on improving the academic preparation of minority students rather than eliminating standardized tests like the SAT. The author argues that affirmative action, in its current form, may place students in environments that are too demanding for their level of preparedness, leading to high dropout rates. The author emphasizes the need for better primary and secondary education to ensure that minority students are genuinely equipped to succeed in college, rather than relying on adjustments to the admissions process that may not serve the long-term interests of the students."	0.03077	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The authors of the text demonstrate a clear position in favor of affirmative action, as they emphasize the need to address unequal access to job training programs along racial lines. They advocate for expanding opportunities and specifically mention the underrepresentation and potential of black women in managerial positions. The authors argue for affirmative action as a way to invest in human capital and promote lifelong learning and skill acquisition, particularly for marginalized groups. They also discuss the importance of mentoring and guiding the next generation, which indicates a proactive stance on ensuring equal opportunities. The focus on competencies over stereotypes and the call for continuous learning for mid-career employees further supports their affirmative stance.	"Summary:
The article discusses a study titled ""Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991,"" which examined the participation of black and white women in job training programs over two decades. The study found that while participation in such programs increased for both groups, white women were more likely to be involved in managerial and professional training. In the 1970s, black women were more likely to be in clerical and semi-skilled programs, and although this segregation disappeared in the 1980s, overall participation of black women in training programs declined. The study also found that job training led to higher wages for participants, regardless of the program's duration or the individual's educational level and work history.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors argue that affirmative action is necessary to address the unequal access to job training programs along racial lines. They advocate for expanding job training opportunities (""expanding the job training pie"") rather than limiting access for some groups. The authors suggest that businesses should view job training as an investment in human capital that benefits both the employees and the company's bottom line. They emphasize the importance of lifelong learning and skill acquisition for individual workers, particularly black women, who must proactively seek out training opportunities to advance their careers.

The authors also call for a responsibility to mentor and guide the next generation of women entering the workforce, advocating for education in STEM fields to prepare them for future opportunities. They stress that businesses should focus on competencies rather than stereotypes and should invest in continuous learning for mid-career employees. The authors highlight the need for organizations to fully utilize talent and avoid wasting the potential of black women who are underrepresented in managerial positions. They conclude that job training is crucial for personal advancement and organizational success in a competitive market."	0.03096	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text supports affirmative action, viewing it as a tool to correct historical imbalances and promote diversity, especially in the context of the police and fire departments of Chicago. The author positively portrays Mayor Daley's efforts to integrate these departments and criticizes the unions' resistance to affirmative action as obstructive. The encouragement for black and Hispanic police and firefighters to become more involved in their unions and to prepare for exams suggests a belief in proactive engagement alongside affirmative action measures. The author's perspective aligns affirmative action with progress and necessary change, thus indicating a stance that is in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the efforts of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago to integrate the city's police and fire departments by promoting more black and Hispanic officers. The police and fire unions, particularly the Fraternal Order of Police and the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, are portrayed as resistant to these changes. The police union has been running radio ads that criticize the use of affirmative action in promotions, while the fire union has been reluctant to move away from a promotions system based solely on test scores. After extensive negotiations, the fire union agreed to allow a small percentage of promotions to be based on job performance. The author suggests that the unions are out of step with the racial and ethnic composition of the city and its workforce, and that the administration is making progress despite their resistance. The author also encourages black and Hispanic police and firefighters to become more involved in their unions and prepare for exams as a means of exerting influence and advancing their careers.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary tool for correcting historical imbalances and promoting diversity within the police and fire departments. They view Mayor Daley's efforts to integrate the command structures of these departments as a positive step, even if partially motivated by political peacekeeping. The unions' resistance to affirmative action is depicted as self-serving and obstructive to the goal of creating a more equitable and representative workforce. The author also suggests that criticism of the slow pace of change from within the minority groups should be channeled into more active involvement and self-preparation, implying that affirmative action alone cannot achieve the desired outcomes without the proactive engagement of those it aims to benefit. Overall, the author sees affirmative action as a practical and necessary measure, albeit one that requires commitment and hard work from all stakeholders to be effective."	0.025209999999999996	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be in favor of reparations as a means to address historical injustices against African-Americans, seeing it as a logical, economically sound, and morally responsible action. While the text does not discuss affirmative action policies directly, the author's positive view of reparations as a form of redress for past discrimination suggests that they may be somewhat in favor of affirmative action as well. This is inferred from the mention of reparations being an alternative to the 'contentious debates surrounding affirmative action,' which implies a belief in the need for policies that address racial disparities, although reparations are presented as a potentially more agreeable solution.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historic event where the U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed to pay reparations to African-American farmers as a settlement for a 1997 class-action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in the distribution of farm loans and subsidies. The settlement includes at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief for each affected farmer, as well as the return of foreclosed lands. The decline of African-American farmers from 14% in 1920 to less than 1% is attributed to discriminatory practices by the USDA. The total claims are expected to exceed $375 million, although some farmers believe this amount is insufficient. The lawsuit and settlement are seen as a rationale for a broader claim of reparations for African-Americans due to a history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. Rep. John Conyers has repeatedly introduced a bill to study slavery's impact and consider reparations, but it has not passed. The text suggests that reparations are a logical, economically sound, and morally responsible action, drawing a parallel with Germany's reparations to Israel for the Holocaust.

The author views the reparations settlement as an alternative to the contentious debates surrounding affirmative action and other preference policies. The author suggests that reparations offer a logical and morally justified solution to address historical injustices against African-Americans, which have led to persistent economic and health disparities. The text implies that reparations could be a more universally palatable approach, as they would be funded through the tax system and are framed as a responsibility similar to that acknowledged by Germany in its reparations to Jewish victims. The author seems to advocate for reparations as a form of redress that goes beyond the scope of affirmative action, addressing the broader historical context of racial discrimination and its long-term effects."	0.0298	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the Chicago Fire Fighters Union's attempt to eliminate 'merit' promotions, which have helped black and Hispanic firefighters advance. This criticism implies that the author believes in the importance of maintaining and supporting affirmative action policies that aid in diversifying the workforce. The author's call for Mayor Richard Daley to implement reforms against discriminatory behavior suggests a stance that is in favor of affirmative action, as they view it as a tool to combat racism and unfair practices within the fire department.	"Summary:
The Chicago Fire Fighters Union, led by William Kugelman, has made a controversial initial contract offer that has highlighted the need for significant changes within the organization to address issues of racism and unfair practices. Kugelman, who is known for his opposition to affirmative action, was involved in the 1980 strike and is currently the union president. The contract dispute centers around the promotion process within the fire department, with the union aiming to eliminate ""merit"" promotions that have facilitated the advancement of some black and Hispanic firefighters. The union's proposal includes an excessive pay increase demand and the addition of two paid holidays, one of which (Bud Billiken Day) is seen as a racially charged provocation. The author urges Mayor Richard Daley to reject the union's demands and to implement reforms to end discriminatory behavior within the fire department.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text is critical of William Kugelman and the Chicago Fire Fighters Union's stance on affirmative action. The author views the union's efforts to eliminate ""merit"" promotions as regressive and an attempt to undermine the progress made in diversifying the fire department's command structure. The text suggests that the author supports the idea of a fire service command that reflects the diversity of the city and disapproves of the union's actions that aim to reverse the advancements of minorities. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is necessary to overcome the racism and pettiness within the fire department, and they advocate for Mayor Daley to push for reforms that support this objective."	0.0217	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly express their personal views on affirmative action within the text provided. The mention of affirmative action is purely in the context of listing it as one of the topics covered by the questionnaire on a candidate-matching website. The author's primary focus is on the usefulness of these websites in matching voters with presidential candidates based on policy preferences, rather than expressing a stance on any particular issue, including affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses how the internet has facilitated the process of selecting a presidential candidate by providing websites that match users with candidates based on their political views. The author mentions two websites, selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com, which offer questionnaires on various national issues. After taking the quizzes, the author shares the results, which suggest Libertarian candidate Harry Browne as their top match, followed by Alan Keyes, Orrin Hatch, George W. Bush, and Steve Forbes. The author also humorously notes the least compatible candidates, indicating a potential emigration to Canada if they were elected. The text critiques the websites for not considering certain issues, experience, temperament, and political skills, which could lead to misleading results. However, the author appreciates the focus on substantive policy issues and encourages readers to use these tools to make an informed decision, albeit with a grain of salt.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express their personal views on affirmative action within this text. The mention of affirmative action comes in the context of listing the topics covered by the questionnaire on selectsmart.com. The author's primary focus is on the usefulness of these websites in matching voters with candidates based on policy preferences, rather than on any single issue. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from this text alone."	0.02546	affirmative action	txt/419118450.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to support Clarence Thomas' willingness to challenge popular opinions on race-related issues, including affirmative action. The author's admiration for Thomas' courage and resilience in facing criticism for his views suggests a perspective that aligns with Thomas' skepticism of affirmative action. The text does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action, but the context implies that the author may share Thomas' critical view of it. The author's focus on the need for honest debate and the courage to confront backlash indicates a belief that affirmative action policies should be scrutinized. However, without a direct statement from the author on their stance toward affirmative action, it is not possible to definitively categorize the author as 'strongly against' or 'somewhat against.'	"Summary:
The author of the text recounts their experience of reading contrasting opinions about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at a dinner hosted by the American Enterprise Institute. While columnist Maureen Dowd criticized the speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying,"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" the author found it inspiring. The author notes that the audience, which was mostly white, was attentively silent during Thomas' hour-long speech and gave him a notably long standing ovation. The author interprets this as a sign that the audience shared their perception of the speech's message about ""duty, honor, country."" The author disagrees with Dowd's comparison of Thomas' words to Bill Clinton's controversial pardon, arguing that it takes courage to stand by one's principles and speak the truth, as Thomas did. The author also highlights Thomas' willingness to challenge popular opinions on race-related issues like affirmative action, despite the personal attacks he might face. The author admires Thomas for his courage and resilience in navigating his journey from his beginnings in Georgia to the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author conveys a perspective that Clarence Thomas, as a black man, has shown courage by questioning commonly held beliefs about race-related issues, including affirmative action. The author implies that Thomas' stance on affirmative action and other issues often leads to harsh criticism, especially from within the black community, where such dissent is sometimes seen as a form of betrayal. The author seems to support Thomas' approach, suggesting that honest debate on these topics is necessary and that it requires bravery to confront the backlash that comes with challenging the status quo. Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action, among other policies, should be open to scrutiny and debate, and that doing so is a matter of principle and integrity."	0.028929999999999997	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their discussion of the importance of diversity in education following the September 11 attacks and the belief that diversity has educational benefits for all students. They argue that diversity is a compelling national interest and acknowledge the potential negative impact on minority admissions if race-blind policies are adopted. The author also challenges the idea that test scores and grades are the sole measures of merit, suggesting that a variety of experiences and viewpoints are valuable in a college environment. This perspective aligns with being in favor of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The article discusses the renewed importance of diversity in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as Americans became more aware of their collective identity and the variety of faces and names within the nation. This shift in perspective led to increased interest in learning about different cultures, languages, and international relations on college campuses. The author then transitions to the debate over affirmative action in college admissions, noting that the ""diversity rationale"" has replaced the previous justification of remedying past racial discrimination. Conflicting court decisions have created a patchwork of policies regarding race-conscious admissions, and the Supreme Court may eventually have to resolve the issue. The article argues that diversity has educational benefits for all students and that merit can be measured in ways beyond test scores and grades. The author highlights the potential drop in minority admissions if race-blind policies are adopted and cites University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor's belief in the necessity of a diverse higher education environment to foster understanding and empathy among students.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action policies in college admissions, emphasizing the importance of diversity as an educational goal that benefits all students. They argue that diversity is a compelling national interest and that race and ethnicity should be considered in admissions to further this goal. The author suggests that diversity is crucial for creating a learning environment where students can understand different perspectives and challenges the argument that a diverse student body is not necessary for a stimulating educational experience. They also point out that standardized test scores and grades are not the only indicators of merit and that students from different backgrounds can bring valuable experiences and viewpoints to a college campus. Overall, the author believes that in a pluralistic society, especially after the collective experience of September 11, diversity in education is more important than ever and that affirmative action is a means to achieve this diversity."	0.03	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The focus of the text is on a scandal involving fraud and corruption related to affirmative action contracts, not on affirmative action as a policy. The author criticizes the exploitation of affirmative action for personal gain and the associated corruption, but does not express a clear stance on the policy itself. The criticism is directed more at the individuals abusing the system and the need for accountability rather than the policy of affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action itself cannot be determined from the summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses a scandal involving the Duffs, a family with ties to the Chicago Outfit and friends of the mayor of Chicago, who were about to be indicted for a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud scheme. The author, while waiting for a news conference about the indictment, decides to have lunch at Gene & Georgetti's, a steakhouse frequented by the Duffs and a hub for local politicians and insiders. The author reflects on the relationship between the mayor and the Duffs, criticizing the mayor for allowing his friends to profit from government contracts and comparing the media's treatment of this scandal to the scrutiny faced by the late Mayor Harold Washington in similar situations. The author suggests a racial bias in the media's approach, noting the intensity of coverage when the scandal involved a black mayor. The article also praises the role of an independent federal prosecutor in bringing about the indictment and highlights the importance of accountability in government.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but the context of the article suggests a criticism of the misuse and exploitation of affirmative action policies. The Duffs, a white family, are accused of running fraudulent front companies to secure city contracts intended for businesses owned by women or minorities. The author seems to be critical of how affirmative action, a policy designed to address inequality, can be manipulated by those with connections and power to their own advantage, thereby undermining the policy's intent and effectiveness. The author's focus on the indictment and the associated corruption suggests a concern that affirmative action can be subverted by fraudulent activities, which not only is illegal but also harms the communities that the policy is meant to support."	0.02972	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to recognize the challenges and tensions associated with affirmative action, particularly within the Chicago Fire Department. They highlight the necessity of affirmative action to ensure fairness and address historical imbalances in the workplace, despite the resentment it has caused among some individuals. The author condemns the racist behavior of firefighters who oppose affirmative action and calls for action to maintain the integrity of the department. This perspective shows a belief in the value of affirmative action as a tool for promoting justice and equality, even though it may not be a perfect solution and has led to some negative reactions.	"Summary:
The text discusses a series of racist incidents involving the Chicago Fire Department, where firefighters have used department radios to broadcast racial slurs, and one firefighter even appeared in blackface to protest affirmative action. This behavior has sparked outrage and concern about the integrity of the department and its commitment to serving all citizens of Chicago. Fire Commissioner James Joyce and Mayor Richard Daley have both stated that such behavior will not be tolerated and could lead to dismissal. The department has faced challenges in the past with addressing racism within its ranks, including reinstating firefighters who were previously fired for racist behavior. The text calls for those firefighters who do not condone such bigotry to step up and help identify the perpetrators and restore the department's integrity, emphasizing that public service should be the ultimate goal of every firefighter.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it is a necessary measure to ensure fairness within the fire department. The author acknowledges that affirmative action has caused resentment among some white firefighters who feel they have been unfairly overlooked for promotions in favor of minority colleagues. However, the author criticizes the extreme and vicious bigotry expressed by some firefighters as an unacceptable response to their frustrations over affirmative action policies. The text suggests that the goal of affirmative action—to promote fairness—is a just and important one, even if it has been met with resistance and has contributed to tension within the department. The author appears to support the efforts of Fire Commissioner Joyce to promote minority firefighters as a step towards rectifying historical imbalances and creating a more equitable workplace."	0.029740000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially regarding its implementation and potential for exploitation in Chicago. The mention of white individuals fraudulently obtaining affirmative action contracts suggests that the author sees the policy as vulnerable to abuse. Furthermore, the implication that Mayor Daley's appointment of Trotter may be politically motivated rather than a sincere attempt to address diversity issues indicates skepticism towards the genuine effectiveness of affirmative action in this context. The author's critical view of the manipulation of affirmative action for personal or political gain suggests a stance that is somewhat against the policy, at least as it is applied in the scenario described.	"Summary:
The Mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley, has replaced the retiring white Fire Commissioner, James Joyce, with Cortez Trotter, a black man who has a background as a paramedic rather than a firefighter. Trotter's appointment is historic not only because he is the first black man to lead the predominantly white department but also because it is unusual for someone from the paramedic side to take this role. Trotter has emphasized the importance of addressing diversity issues within the department and has warned against any discriminatory behavior. The change in leadership comes at a time when the city is dealing with racial controversies and the upcoming trial of white individuals who fraudulently obtained affirmative action contracts. The author suggests that Trotter's appointment may also serve to protect Mayor Daley politically, as the city is predominantly black and Latino.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least in the context of how it has been exploited in Chicago. The text mentions that white individuals, specifically the Duffs, have been charged with fraudulently receiving $100 million in affirmative action contracts, which implies that these contracts were intended for minority-owned firms. The author seems to view affirmative action as a policy that can be manipulated for personal gain, rather than serving its intended purpose of helping underrepresented groups. Additionally, the author suggests that Mayor Daley is using the appointment of Trotter, a black man, to high-profile positions as a political strategy to deflect criticism and maintain his hold on power, rather than as a genuine effort to promote diversity. The perspective presented is somewhat skeptical of the motives behind affirmative action policies in the context of Chicago politics, indicating a belief that they can be used as a cover for political maneuvering rather than as a means to achieve equality."	0.02954	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical and skeptical tone toward the affirmative action system, as evidenced by the discussion of the Duff case, suggests a negative stance. The author highlights the exploitation of affirmative action by individuals who were not the intended beneficiaries, implying that the system is flawed and subject to abuse. The sarcastic questioning of the system's integrity further indicates disapproval. However, the author's criticism seems primarily focused on the implementation and exploitation of affirmative action, rather than the concept itself. This nuanced view suggests that the author may support the idea in principle but is against how it is practiced in the given context, making it difficult to categorize the stance as 'strongly against.'	"Summary:
The author narrates a brief phone conversation with Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, who was the former purchasing agent for Mayor Richard Daley's administration in Chicago. Grzyb denies knowledge of the controversial ""Duff"" case, which involves allegations that white men with organized crime connections, known as the Duffs, fraudulently obtained $100 million in affirmative action contracts by pretending to be minorities. The author criticizes the lack of media coverage and visual interest in the story, despite its significance. Grzyb, now employed at a company owned by a Daley associate, refuses to comment further on the case. The mayor also declines to comment, citing the ongoing federal investigation. The author sarcastically questions the integrity of the affirmative action system in light of this scandal.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and skeptical, particularly in the context of the Duff case. The author implies that the affirmative action program in Mayor Daley's administration was exploited by individuals who were not intended beneficiaries of the policy. The Duffs, who are white men, allegedly claimed minority status to win contracts meant to help actual minorities. This mockery of the system leads the author to question the fairness and effectiveness of affirmative action when it can be so easily manipulated for fraudulent purposes. The tone suggests that the author sees affirmative action as a noble idea but one that is vulnerable to corruption, especially when oversight is lax and those in power are complicit."	0.0289	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt	1
	None	The author, Clarence Page, does not directly address affirmative action in terms of support or opposition. Instead, he recounts historical anecdotes and the business philosophy of John H. Johnson, which emphasizes individual merit, excellence, and becoming indispensable through one's own efforts. The reference to Matthew Henson's story is used to highlight the importance of personal skill and knowledge, rather than affirmative action, in achieving success. As such, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, and there is insufficient information to categorize the author's stance on the policy.	"Summary:
John H. Johnson, the influential black publisher who founded Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, passed away at the age of 87. His publications were essential for representing a more prosperous and positive image of black America during a time when mainstream media did not. Johnson's business acumen and resilience allowed him to overcome significant obstacles, such as starting Negro Digest with a small loan from his mother and boosting its circulation with help from a column by Eleanor Roosevelt. He launched Ebony in 1945 and Jet in 1951, with the latter playing a crucial role in the civil rights movement by publishing the photos of Emmett Till. Despite criticisms of his publications' focus on the black middle class, Johnson's work filled a crucial gap in media representation and paved the way for black-oriented media to attract major corporate advertisers. His autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" and his life's work serve as case studies in leadership and problem-solving. Johnson's advice, ""Make yourself indispensable,"" reflects his belief in the importance of providing value, service, and quality in business, regardless of racial loyalty.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clarence Page, does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of contemporary policy debates. However, he does reference it in a historical anecdote about Matthew Henson, a black man who played a key role in Admiral Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole. Johnson highlighted Henson's story to illustrate the importance of making oneself indispensable through skill and knowledge, not because of affirmative action or charity. Henson was hired because he learned the language of the Inuit, not through a diversity initiative.

Page uses this story to underscore Johnson's business philosophy—success comes from being indispensable, which is achieved through merit and the quality of one's work rather than through programs like affirmative action. Johnson's own success in persuading major corporations to advertise in his publications further exemplifies this principle. While the text does not offer a comprehensive view on affirmative action, it suggests a focus on individual excellence and the creation of opportunities through one's own efforts."	0.03233	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the analysis of the presidential debates and the performance of the candidates, with affirmative action mentioned only as one of the divisive issues discussed. There is no indication of the author's personal stance on the matter, as the emphasis is on the political strategies and dynamics of the campaign rather than on individual policy positions.	"### Summary:

The article analyzes the domestic policy debate during the 2004 presidential campaign, framing it as a polarized contest between those who adore President George W. Bush and those who despise him. The author suggests that while John Kerry has not captured the hearts of voters to the same extent, he has proven his prowess in debating. The final debate focused on divisive issues such as abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, faith, taxes, and the role of government in health care and education, clearly delineating the candidates' opposing stances.

Bush faced the challenge of defending his tenure during wartime and economic difficulties, while Kerry attacked his record and played to themes of class warfare. Social issues saw Bush taking conservative stances, potentially energizing his base but not necessarily attracting undecided voters. Both candidates attempted to deliver impactful lines, with varying degrees of success.

The author notes the importance of personal connection in presidential races and observes that while Bush displayed more warmth, especially when speaking about his wife, Kerry struggled to match Bush's relatability. The debates have been advantageous for Kerry, who gained credibility, while Bush's performance was more variable but not damaging.

Looking ahead, the candidates will likely focus on their campaign trails, targeting specific markets. The author concludes by reflecting on the historical significance of debate performance for incumbent presidents, suggesting that Bush needs to use the remaining weeks to make a convincing case for reelection.

### Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action. However, they note that the issue was one of several contentious topics discussed in the final debate, implying its significance in the broader political discourse. The author's focus is more on the strategies and performance of the candidates rather than on taking a stance on the issues themselves."	0.03252	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's use of terms like 'purported silliness' when describing affirmative action policies indicates a critical view of these policies. By discussing the satirical actions of students that mock political correctness and affirmative action, and suggesting that the best response is to ignore rather than to address such provocations, the author implies a stance that is critical of affirmative action. The author does not explicitly state opposition to the concept of affirmative action, but the tone and content suggest that they view it as a form of political correctness that may not effectively address social inequalities. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the satirical actions taken by some students at Columbia College Chicago, which mock what they perceive as the extreme levels of political correctness on college campuses. The students have proposed activities like an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" where the prices of baked goods vary based on the customer's race, and a game called ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant,"" where participants chase a student pretending to be an undocumented immigrant. These activities are not unique to Columbia; similar events have occurred at other elite universities. The author notes that while such actions are legal and part of free speech, they can be hurtful, as exemplified by the pain caused by Don Imus's derogatory comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The author suggests that the best response to such provocations is to ignore them, rather than creating policies or committees that might be seen as overly politically correct.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and somewhat mocking. They describe the ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale"" as a way to confront the college community with the ""purported silliness"" of discriminating based on race, suggesting that the author views affirmative action policies as a form of racial discrimination, albeit with the intention of favoring historically marginalized groups. The author seems to believe that affirmative action policies are an example of political correctness that goes too far and that such policies are not beyond critique or satire. The tone of the text indicates that the author may see these policies as well-intentioned but ultimately misguided efforts to address social inequalities."	0.0242	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Charles Krauthammer, does not express a personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The text discusses the American presidential campaign process and its duration, and only briefly mentions affirmative action in the context of policy debates that could emerge during campaigns. The mention of Barack Obama's suggestion about moving from race-based to class-based preferences is used to illustrate the kind of discussions that can take place, but Krauthammer does not endorse or criticize this view. Therefore, based on the provided summary, it is not possible to categorize Krauthammer's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
Charles Krauthammer discusses the prolonged nature of American presidential campaigns in comparison to other countries like Britain and Canada, where elections are concluded much more quickly. He argues that the extended campaign season in the U.S. has several functions: it tests candidates' managerial skills, builds party consensus and democratic legitimacy, and satisfies the American desire for egalitarianism by subjecting candidates to a grueling process that humbles them before they can attain the 'kingship' of the presidency. Krauthammer acknowledges the absurdities and excesses of the campaign process but contends that it serves important purposes, including the testing of candidates' abilities and the public's demand for candidates to demonstrate their commonality with the electorate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Krauthammer suggests that the extended nature of U.S. elections allows for significant policy debates to emerge. He highlights Barack Obama's suggestion during a television interview about moving away from race-based preferences to class-based preferences as a potential catalyst for a historic debate within the Democratic Party on affirmative action. This indicates that Krauthammer sees the endless campaign as a platform for discussing and possibly redefining key policy issues like affirmative action, although he does not explicitly state his personal stance on the policy. He acknowledges the possibility of a shift in national consensus through this process, suggesting an openness to evolving discussions on such matters."	0.02612	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the role of affirmative action in Lewis Hamilton's career but emphasizes Hamilton's talent and achievements as the primary reasons for his success. The author views affirmative action as a fair opportunity that Hamilton capitalized on through skill and hard work, suggesting a belief that while affirmative action can provide initial opportunities, individual merit is the key to success.	"Summary:
Lewis Hamilton, a 22-year-old Formula One driver, is making an exceptional start to his career and is being compared to some of the greatest names in the sport, such as Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. His performance is notable for his rapid ascension in the rankings, achieving third and second places in his first two races. Hamilton is part of the McLaren-Mercedes team, and he has been following the protocol of supporting his senior teammate, Fernando Alonso, by not challenging him directly but instead defending against other competitors. His skillful driving and strategic maneuvers have impressed many, and he is currently third in the world championship standings, which is a record for a rookie. Hamilton's success story includes a touch of affirmative action, as he was signed to a developmental contract at a young age due to his talent, and he has since proven his worth through various racing series. His opportunity in F1 partly arose due to Juan Pablo Montoya leaving McLaren, opening up a spot for Hamilton.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges that affirmative action plays a role in Lewis Hamilton's story but emphasizes that it was only a slight factor, just enough to be fair in the costly world of racing. The author suggests that Hamilton's talent and achievements are the primary reasons for his success. The mention of affirmative action seems to indicate that Hamilton was given a fair opportunity to compete and develop within the sport, which he has capitalized on through his skill and hard work. The author's perspective appears to be that while affirmative action may have provided an initial opportunity, Hamilton's success is largely due to his own merits and dedication."	0.026819999999999997	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's text does not focus on affirmative action as a primary subject, and there is no clear indication of the author's overall stance on affirmative action. The brief mention of affirmative action contracts being given to white men instead of black women is used to illustrate a point about political hypocrisy rather than to express a viewpoint on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text, and the author should be categorized as 'not concerned with affirmative action' in the context of this discussion.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on President Barack Obama's handling of the AIG bonus scandal during his appearance on ""The Tonight Show."" The author points out Obama's gaffe regarding the Special Olympics but emphasizes that the more significant mistake was his feigned surprise over AIG executives receiving bonuses from bailout funds. The author asserts that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was aware of the bonuses well in advance, suggesting that the Democrats' outrage was performative and politically motivated to cover themselves for the upcoming 2010 elections. The author compares the political maneuvers in Washington to the corrupt practices in Chicago politics, implying that the Obama administration is influenced by the same tactics. The piece also criticizes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's response to the AIG situation and the media's compliance in shifting the focus away from difficult questions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly discuss affirmative action as a policy or concept. However, there is a brief mention of Mayor Richard Daley giving $100 million in affirmative action contracts to white men instead of black women, which the author uses as an analogy to highlight the hypocrisy and lack of transparency in political dealings. This anecdote suggests that the author views affirmative action within the context of political manipulation rather than as a policy for addressing inequality or promoting diversity. The author's sarcastic tone when referring to the incident implies a critical view of how affirmative action was implemented in that particular situation, but it does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the author's views towards affirmative action in general."	0.028620000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat in favor, as indicated by the positive discussion of the IMPACT program's efforts to increase board diversity and the recognition of the challenges faced by minorities in being recruited through traditional networks. The author acknowledges the necessity of such programs in the current climate, despite expressing a wish for a more naturally inclusive environment. The mention of a participant's view that the program is not affirmative action suggests that the author is aware of the nuances and potential criticisms of affirmative action but still sees the value in proactive diversity initiatives.	"Summary:
The text discusses efforts to increase diversity on the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofit organizations. Phyllis Lockett, an African-American woman with impressive credentials, was recruited by executive Charles Tribbett III to join a prominent board. The recruitment is part of a program called IMPACT, which spent $400,000 over three years to place nine qualified minorities on nonprofit boards. The program was funded by the Joyce Foundation, Boeing Co., and The Chicago Community Trust, and aimed to expand board diversity beyond the traditional networks. Despite challenges, including the recession and some organizations declining to participate, the program successfully placed new minority members on six boards. The recruits were expected to meet annual giving requirements, and there was concern about enforcing these standards and avoiding tokenism. The author of the text, Melissa Harris, expresses a wish for diversity without the need for special programs.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but there are hints of support for diversity initiatives in the context of board recruitment. The use of the term ""affirmative action"" by one of the participants, Lyndon Taylor, suggests a distinction between the IMPACT program and traditional affirmative action. Taylor states, ""Everyone we placed was a peer. There was no affirmative action,"" implying that the candidates were selected based on their qualifications and not solely on their minority status.

The overall tone of the article suggests that the author views the need for such programs as unfortunate but necessary due to the lack of diversity on boards and the difficulties in recruiting minority candidates from within the existing networks. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue, including the potential for tokenism and the challenge of meeting fundraising expectations. Melissa Harris's closing remark, wishing diversity didn't require a special program, indicates a desire for a more naturally inclusive environment that doesn't necessitate intervention but recognizes the current need for such programs to achieve diversity goals."	0.03058	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is centered on the historical interpretation of Martin Luther King Jr.'s views rather than a direct expression of their own stance on the policy. The author is concerned with the accuracy of how King's perspectives are represented and warns against ideological revisionism. There is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action; instead, the focus is on the importance of understanding King's views within their historical context and the problem of misusing those views in contemporary debates. The author's stance is not explicitly stated in the summary provided.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., suggesting that his famous ""I have a dream"" speech has led some to see him as an unrealistic idealist without a practical plan for achieving his goals. However, the author argues that King was also a problem-solver, as evidenced by his book ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,"" which provided concrete proposals for addressing various social issues. The author warns against misrepresenting King's views to suit current agendas, as was done during the debate over Proposition 209 in California, and acknowledges the complexity and contradictions in King's positions and personal life. The article outlines King's ideas on a range of topics, including the black family, education, political engagement, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare. Despite the mixed success and current relevance of his proposals, the author concludes that King's vision and efforts still offer valuable leadership compared to contemporary politicians and community leaders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Martin Luther King Jr.'s views on affirmative action have been subject to misuse and distortion, especially during the debate over Proposition 209 in California. This indicates a concern for the integrity of King's historical stance and an objection to the practice of ideological revisionism. The author does not provide a detailed explanation of King's position on affirmative action but implies that King's remarks on the subject were limited and that the concept was only in its infancy during the 1960s. The author's perspective seems to emphasize the importance of understanding King's views within their original context and cautions against oversimplifying or misappropriating his legacy to serve current political ends."	0.03022	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's brief mention of affirmative action within the context of California's political scapegoating does not provide enough information to determine a clear stance on the issue. Affirmative action is listed among various topics used by politicians to gain votes, which suggests the author views it as a political tool rather than taking a position on the policy itself. The author's focus is on the cyclical nature of political issues in California and the cynicism that can arise from reporting on these recurring themes, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the recurring themes and issues in California, such as its volatile geography, water scarcity, and political scapegoating of different groups over time. It highlights the state's constant battle with water allocation, particularly concerning the Colorado River, and the pattern of politicians targeting various ""Others"" to gain votes, with the implication that Asians may be the next target. The author expresses a journalist's frustration with the repetitiveness of news stories, which can lead to cynicism in the profession. Despite the sense of déjà vu, the author predicts that many of the same stories, from water wars to celebrity updates, will continue to make headlines in the future. The text also touches on the unending nature of certain political debates, like the regulation of gambling, which persist because they are financially lucrative for those involved.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is mentioned briefly and somewhat cynically within the context of California's history of political campaigns against various groups. The author lists ""beneficiaries of affirmative action"" among those targeted by vote-seekers in the past, suggesting that affirmative action is seen as a divisive issue used by politicians to rally support by appealing to biases or fears of their constituents. This mention implies that affirmative action, like other issues, is subject to being politicized and used as a wedge issue in California politics. However, the text does not provide an in-depth analysis or a clear stance on affirmative action itself; rather, it is cited as an example of recurring political strategies in the state's history."	0.02834	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt	1
	None	The author, Ronald Brownstein, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. His discussion is centered around the broader context of American optimism and the public's current political attitudes. Brownstein mentions affirmative action as an issue that has been a point of contention in the past, especially among conservatives. However, he indicates that in a climate of increased optimism and confidence, the public may be less interested in ideological battles over such policies. Brownstein's focus on the shift towards a pragmatic approach to governance suggests that he is more interested in discussing how the political landscape is changing rather than advocating for or against specific policies like affirmative action.	"Summary:
Ronald Brownstein's article discusses the resurgence of American optimism, a significant shift from the pervasive pessimism of the previous 25 years. He notes that most Americans now feel the country is moving in the right direction, with consumer confidence at a 28-year high and President Clinton enjoying strong approval ratings. This renewed optimism is attributed to a robust economy, low unemployment, shrinking federal budget deficits, and reductions in crime and family instability. Brownstein suggests that America's regained status as a leader in technology and culture, with companies like Microsoft and cultural hubs like Hollywood and Silicon Valley, has also contributed to this positive outlook.

Brownstein argues that this optimism could change the political landscape, as the public may no longer be as receptive to the ideological agendas pushed by both the left and the right, which previously capitalized on American anxieties. He mentions that politicians have yet to fully grasp the implications of governing a society with a renewed sense of confidence. In a more optimistic environment, Americans are less interested in radical changes and more in favor of incremental progress and political compromise.

However, Brownstein cautions against complacency, noting that despite the positive trends, the country still faces serious challenges such as underperforming schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, and the costs associated with an aging population. He suggests that the current period of prosperity should be used to address these issues, just as the post-World War II generation did by investing in infrastructure, education, and social welfare.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Brownstein briefly touches on affirmative action as one of the issues that conservatives have historically criticized, blaming it for contributing to the nation's problems. He implies that in the current climate of optimism, the public is less inclined to view affirmative action and other traditional conservative targets (such as big government, welfare, and immigration) as significant threats. The author doesn't explicitly state his own view on affirmative action, but he suggests that the public's waning interest in ideological battles could diminish the controversy surrounding such policies. The focus, according to Brownstein, seems to be shifting toward a more pragmatic approach to governance and problem-solving."	0.03579	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights enforcement funding indicates a supportive stance towards affirmative action. By emphasizing the need for strict law enforcement to guarantee equal opportunities and by highlighting Justice Ginsburg's dissent on racial inequalities, the author shows a clear favor towards policies aimed at promoting equality. Furthermore, the author criticizes the logic of affirmative action opponents who support equal opportunity in theory but oppose practical measures to enforce it. This demonstrates a belief in the necessity of affirmative action to address discrimination and ensure fair chances for all, aligning with the administration's efforts to make decision-making in employment, housing, and other areas more impartial.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton administration's proposal to boost civil rights enforcement by increasing funding by 17%, addressing the issue of racial barriers in employment, housing, and other areas. The author emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of laws to ensure equal opportunities regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. The proposal includes an increase in funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to address the backlog of cases and promote mediation, as well as for the Justice Department's civil rights division and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to hire testers to uncover disparities in housing. The author suggests that while dialogue on race is important, concrete actions such as these are crucial for achieving fairness.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be in favor of affirmative action, highlighting the eloquent dissent of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the persistent racial inequalities and discrimination in society. The author questions the logic of opponents of affirmative action who claim to support equal opportunity yet reject the enforcement of laws that promote equality. The perspective is that affirmative action and related civil rights enforcement are necessary to overcome the lingering effects of discrimination and to ensure that everyone has an equal chance at success in various aspects of life. The author supports the Clinton administration's efforts to increase funding for civil rights enforcement as a means to make decision-making by employers, contractors, mortgage lenders, and landlords more impartial and to give everyone the fair shot they deserve."	0.022420000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt	1
	None	The text does not provide enough information to determine the author's personal stance on affirmative action. The author only mentions affirmative action in the context of Richard Riordan's political position and its potential impact on his appeal to Republican voters. There is no direct commentary, support, criticism, or analysis of affirmative action from the author's perspective. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be categorized based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of having a ""fire in the belly"" in both sports and politics, referring to a strong desire to win and achieve goals. The author reflects on the California gubernatorial race, where several potential candidates chose not to run, leaving four contenders: Republican Dan Lungren and Democrats Gray Davis, Al Checchi, and Jane Harman. The author notes that each of these candidates has the necessary enthusiasm and courage to compete for the governorship. The text also mentions some who opted out of the race, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, who enjoys her role in the Senate, and Leon Panetta, who hesitated too long. L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan also decided against running, prioritizing his love for Los Angeles. The author concludes by urging voters to focus on the candidates who are eager to run and to make their choices among them.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author briefly touches on affirmative action when discussing potential candidate Richard Riordan's political stance. The author notes that Riordan did not support the anti-affirmative action initiatives, which might have made him a less appealing candidate for the Republican nomination, as he would be seen as too moderate or liberal by traditional Republican voters. However, the text does not delve into the author's personal perspective on affirmative action, focusing instead on the political implications of Riordan's stance within the context of the gubernatorial race."	0.02655	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Herschel Rosenthal, does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action. Instead, he focuses on the process of legislative debate and the importance of personal relationships among legislators when discussing sensitive issues, including affirmative action. He expresses concern that the lack of civility and understanding in debates may lead to poorer quality discussions and decisions on such matters. Rosenthal's emphasis is on the social dynamics within the legislative body rather than on the policy of affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately categorize his stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
Herschel Rosenthal reflects on the changes he's observed over his 24-year tenure as a California state legislator. He notes the positive developments, such as increased public involvement in state policy and a legislature that better reflects the state's diversity. However, he is concerned about the decline in personal relationships among legislators, which used to be fostered through social activities and now seems to be eroding. This erosion, he believes, has contributed to a lack of civility and understanding in legislative debates on contentious issues like affirmative action, bilingual education, and illegal immigration. Rosenthal argues that personal relationships are crucial for legislators to work together effectively, especially in a diverse and complex state like California. He suggests that informal gatherings, such as lunches, could help build these essential connections.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Herschel Rosenthal, views the decline in personal relationships among legislators as having a negative impact on the debates surrounding affirmative action and other racially and culturally sensitive issues. He finds it ""heartbreaking"" that legislators debate these matters with a lack of sensitivity or understanding, which he attributes to the lack of personal connections across party and cultural lines. While Rosenthal does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action policies themselves, he implies that the quality of the discourse on such policies has suffered due to the deteriorating relationships and increasing partisanship in the legislature. His perspective suggests that a more empathetic and informed approach to policy-making, fostered by better interpersonal relationships, could lead to more thoughtful and sensitive handling of issues like affirmative action."	0.02554	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, acknowledging its role in creating opportunities for people of color, particularly in professional fields. However, the author is critical of affirmative action's limitations, noting that it does not sufficiently address the needs of the working and poverty classes and does not tackle the systemic issues of racism and economic inequality in a comprehensive manner. The author's perspective suggests a belief in the need for affirmative action to be part of a broader, more nuanced approach to fighting racism and inequality that includes class analysis.	"Summary:
The text delves into the limitations of President Bill Clinton's race-dialogue initiative, arguing that it should encompass class issues alongside race to truly address the challenges faced by poor people of color in America. The author acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action but points out its insufficiency in helping the working and poverty classes. The historical context of the civil rights movement is explored, highlighting how the concept of ""black power"" shifted from political representation to black capitalism, influenced by corporate interests and government leaders. The author criticizes the failure of black capitalism to end racism and suggests that a class analysis combined with anti-racism is necessary. The text calls for a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism, which considers the varying experiences of racism across different economic classes and includes strategies such as equalizing school funding and closing legal loopholes in anti-discrimination laws. The author also emphasizes the need for broad-based employment programs over mere dialogues about race relations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author recognizes the positive impact of affirmative action in creating opportunities for people of color in professional fields, thereby contributing to the growth of a more diverse middle class. However, the author is critical of the limited reach of affirmative action, arguing that it has done little for the working and poverty classes within communities of color. The author believes that while affirmative action can serve as a tool to combat certain disadvantages faced by middle-class people of color, it is not a comprehensive solution to the systemic issues of racism and economic inequality that disproportionately affect poor people of color. The author suggests that affirmative action, as it currently stands, may act as a tokenistic measure or a pacification effort within a fundamentally racist system, rather than a transformative force for broader social change. The text advocates for a more nuanced, class-conscious approach to anti-racist policies and practices."	0.034499999999999996	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the discussion of Rod Pacheco's political stance and the Republican Party's relationship with Latino voters. The author notes Pacheco's support for Proposition 209, which sought to end state racial preferences, suggesting a skeptical view of affirmative action policies. However, the author also highlights the GOP's need to appeal to Latino voters and Pacheco's moderate positions, indicating that the party may be open to adjusting its stance on such issues. The author's focus on political strategy and representation rather than a moral or philosophical evaluation of affirmative action suggests a neutral or nuanced stance rather than a clear position for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the rise of Latino political leaders in California, highlighting the election of the first Latino lieutenant governor in over a century, Cruz Bustamante, and the first Latino Assembly speaker, Antonio Villaraigosa. It then focuses on Rod Pacheco, a Republican Latino who was elected as the Assembly's minority leader, marking a significant moment for Latino representation within the Republican Party. Despite the GOP's losses in the election, Pacheco's rise and the election of three more GOP Latinos to the Assembly are seen as positive developments. Pacheco, a former prosecutor and a centrist, supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, an anti-illegal immigration initiative, but supported Proposition 209, which aimed to end state racial preferences. The text also touches on the Republican Party's need to change its image among Latino voters, who have been alienated by the party's previous stances on issues like affirmative action and illegal immigration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides a nuanced view of affirmative action through the lens of Pacheco's political stance. Pacheco, who supported Proposition 209 to end state racial preferences, appears to align with the Republican Party's general skepticism towards affirmative action policies. This perspective is contextualized within the broader Republican Party's efforts to rebuild its relationship with Latino voters, who may have felt targeted by the party's past campaigns against affirmative action. The author suggests that the GOP is seeking to present a more inclusive image and is using Pacheco's moderate positions to appeal to a wider electorate. The text implies that while Pacheco himself may not be an advocate for affirmative action, his role in the party could signal a shift towards more moderate policies that could attract Latino voters."	0.03041	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author of the text does not provide a personal opinion on affirmative action. Instead, the author discusses affirmative action in the context of its political relevance and how it has shifted over time. The mention of affirmative action is used to illustrate a broader point about changing political priorities, rather than to advocate for or against the policy itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the shift in political priorities in California, with education being the primary concern for politicians and voters in the recent past. Governor Gray Davis and his predecessor Pete Wilson both focused on education reform, but pollster Steve Kinney suggests that other issues like health care and infrastructure will soon become more important to voters. Kinney predicts that as the education issue appears to be addressed by politicians, voters will shift their focus. He uses a polling method that measures the intensity of concern, counting only the responses with the highest level of personal importance. While education still ranks highest, health care is gaining traction. Kinney foresees education slipping in priority, but Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, believes education will remain important for a couple more years. The text also mentions the potential rise in concern for health care as the population ages and infrastructure as the state's population grows. The article concludes by suggesting that Governor Davis should broaden his focus to emerging issues to stay ahead of public and legislative shifts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action briefly in the context of issues that have seen a decline in political urgency. He notes that after the passage of Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action in public employment, education, and contracting in California, the issue cooled down politically. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as a topic that was once a hot-button issue but has since lost its political momentum, similar to illegal immigration and crime after certain measures were passed. The author does not provide an explicit opinion on affirmative action itself but rather comments on its relevance and intensity as a political issue over time."	0.0277	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text but is inferred through the description of Jim Brulte's actions. Brulte's investment in the campaigns of Republican women and minorities indicates a recognition of the value of diversity and suggests a pragmatic approach to affirmative action within the party context. The author appears to view this approach positively, as it is seen as a unifying strategy for the party. However, the text does not provide a clear, explicit stance on affirmative action as a policy, nor does it delve into the broader debate. The author's perspective is therefore interpreted through the lens of a specific individual's actions within a political party rather than a direct commentary on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the state of the California Republican Party, emphasizing its lack of prominent leaders and the challenges it faces. It highlights that the GOP has no major elected officials in top positions, with both the governorship and U.S. Senate seats held by Democrats. The article mentions two statewide elected Republicans, Chuck Quackenbush and Bill Jones, both of whom have faced setbacks. Jim Brulte, the state Senate minority leader, is presented as a key figure in the party, respected for his political acumen and ability to work without compromising his conservative principles.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is indirectly conveyed through the actions and strategies of Jim Brulte. Brulte is seen as a pragmatic leader who avoids divisive issues, including affirmative action. However, he has his own approach to affirmative action within the party, investing $400,000 into the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This action suggests that while Brulte may not engage in the broader affirmative action debate, he recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within the Republican Party and takes practical steps to support it. The author seems to view Brulte's approach as a positive step towards unifying the party and moving away from issues that have historically divided it."	0.02652	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the context in which it is mentioned. The author's critical view of Governor Davis's shift away from centrism and towards a liberal agenda, which includes affirmative action, suggests a negative stance. Since the author implies that affirmative action is part of a series of decisions that contradict a centrist governance approach, it can be deduced that the author may be somewhat against affirmative action. However, the lack of direct commentary on affirmative action itself prevents a conclusive determination of a 'strongly against' stance.	"Summary:
The article discusses California Governor Gray Davis's decision to sign legislation that requires overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, a move that positions California alongside Alaska as the only states with such a law. This action has been interpreted as a shift to the left, contradicting Davis's centrist image. The author argues that while the governor appears moderate in comparison to the liberal California Legislature and his supporting interest groups, he has not been completely centrist in his governance. The legislation is seen as a win for organized labor and a potential loss for California businesses due to decreased flexibility and competitiveness. The author also notes that Davis has made appointments from union, environmental, and trial lawyer groups and has reinstated a form of affirmative action at the University of California. The text suggests that Davis faces challenges in maintaining his moderate image while balancing the demands of his political allies and his centrist promises.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of Governor Davis's actions. The author mentions that Davis has ""orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of affirmative action at the University of California,"" implying that this move is part of a series of decisions that have veered away from a centrist path. The tone suggests that the author views affirmative action as part of a liberal agenda that conflicts with Davis's campaign promise to govern from the center. The author's association of affirmative action with regulatory expansion and the interests of union leaders, trial lawyers, and environmentalists further indicates a belief that such measures are indicative of a more left-leaning, interventionist government approach, rather than a centrist or moderate one."	0.027549999999999998	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex and shows signs of evolution. Initially, they were a staunch advocate for affirmative action, but after considering their son's essay and the nuances of the issue, they seem to lean towards a more refined approach to the policy. They acknowledge the importance of affirmative action for those who face social and economic obstacles but also recognize that it may not be necessary for all minority individuals, such as their son Miguel. The author suggests that affirmative action should be sensitive to social disadvantages rather than being solely race-based. This indicates that the author is in favor of affirmative action but believes it should be adapted to address current social realities and to provide opportunities based on individual circumstances and effort.	"Summary:
The text is a reflection by a parent on their son Miguel's high school essay about affirmative action. The parent, who had previously been an advocate for affirmative action, is initially angered by Miguel's call for its abolition, labeling the program as unfair, outdated, and a form of reverse racism. Miguel, being a Latino student at a predominantly Caucasian school, acknowledges that he could benefit from affirmative action but questions its fairness as he comes from a privileged background with educated parents and ample resources. The parent grapples with their initial reaction and considers the broader implications of affirmative action. They recognize that while their son may not need the program, it remains vital for less privileged students who face significant social disadvantages. The parent discusses the new plan to broaden UC eligibility and the importance of considering social factors in admissions. After a conversation with their son, Miguel revises his stance, suggesting that opportunities should be extended to all who work hard and pursue success, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is multifaceted and evolves throughout the text. Initially, the author is a staunch defender of affirmative action, having advocated for it during their college years and understanding its role in addressing racial disparities in education. However, upon reading their son's essay, the author confronts the possibility that affirmative action may not be necessary for individuals like Miguel, who, despite being a minority, has had access to significant educational and familial resources.

The author grapples with the tension between the individual merit of their son and the collective need for programs that address systemic inequalities. They acknowledge the complexity of the issue by recognizing that while some individuals may not require affirmative action, it remains an essential tool for those who face significant social and economic obstacles.

The author also highlights the evolution of affirmative action policies, suggesting that while the program's original intent was to integrate institutions and provide opportunities for minorities, contemporary measures can be more targeted and nuanced, focusing on students who genuinely need assistance regardless of race.

Ultimately, the author seems to advocate for a form of affirmative action that is sensitive to social disadvantages and not solely based on race. They support policies that acknowledge and reward students who achieve highly within their circumstances, which may disproportionately affect certain races due to systemic adversity. The author appears to favor a reality-based approach to affirmative action, one that adapts to the current social landscape and aims to provide equal opportunities to all who exert effort and aspire to success."	0.03608	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Halford H. Fairchild, criticizes the use of standardized tests like the SAT in college admissions and highlights how these tests perpetuate racial, economic, and cultural inequalities. He emphasizes the need for admissions criteria that better reflect a student's potential and critical thinking, suggesting that the current system is biased and benefits privileged groups. Fairchild's critique of standardized testing and his advocacy for more equitable admissions practices imply that he views affirmative action as a necessary approach to counteract systemic disadvantages faced by minority students. Therefore, his stance appears to be supportive of affirmative action as a means to achieve a more just and inclusive educational system.	"Summary:
Halford H. Fairchild, a professor at Pitzer College, critiques the use of the SAT as a measure of merit for college admissions, arguing that it perpetuates racial, economic, and cultural inequalities. He points out that the test does not accurately predict a student's potential for success and is biased against those who have not been exposed to certain cultural references or advanced coursework. Fairchild also criticizes standardized tests like the SAT II, MCAT, LSAT, and GRE for similar reasons. He notes that these tests are a poor predictor of college success and that the test-preparation industry is costly and benefits from students taking these exams multiple times. Fairchild advocates for admissions criteria that emphasize critical thinking and intercultural awareness and for reallocating resources to expand educational opportunities rather than exclude students based on biased measures.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Halford H. Fairchild, is critical of the way standardized tests like the SAT are used in admissions processes, suggesting that they act as a proxy for maintaining racial and economic advantages for privileged groups. He implies that affirmative action, in contrast, is a necessary countermeasure to address the inherent disadvantages faced by minority students due to systemic inequalities in educational opportunities. Fairchild seems to suggest that abolishing affirmative action, as advocated by individuals like Ward Connerly, without addressing the underlying biases in criteria like the SAT, would only perpetuate the status quo of racial and economic disparities in higher education. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing the attributes of motivation and effort, which are not captured by standardized test scores but are crucial for student success. Fairchild's perspective is that admissions procedures should be reformed to be more equitable and inclusive, allowing for a true assessment of a student's potential and drive."	0.029609999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author reflects positively on the Philadelphia Plan, which was a precursor to affirmative action, and acknowledges its importance in increasing opportunities for minorities and women. This indicates a belief in the necessity of such measures to promote equality and opportunity. The author's favorable discussion of civil rights activism and the legacy of black Republicans who supported these initiatives suggests that the author is at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author, who grew up in a black Republican family, reflects on the challenges and contradictions of being a black Republican. The author's father was a delegate at the 1964 GOP convention and was a firm believer in self-reliance and the importance of black participation in both political parties. The author notes a shift in the reasons why some African Americans join the Republican Party, from a legacy of civil rights activism in the past to various motivations in the present, including the desire to unsettle or take a less competitive path. The author recounts personal experiences working for the Republican Party and ultimately deciding to leave and become a Democrat, as the author's values changed and the era of black Republicans like their father had passed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author discusses affirmative action in a positive light, referencing the Philadelphia Plan implemented under Nixon's presidency as a forerunner to affirmative action efforts. This plan, which was supported by civil rights activists like Art Fletcher, aimed to increase opportunities for minorities and women in the job market by setting specific hiring goals for federal contractors. The author views this legacy of civil rights activism and commitment to the black community as a positive aspect of the Republican Party's past, suggesting a belief in the value of affirmative action policies to promote equality and opportunity."	0.022899999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	Felicia Clark shows concern that the new multiethnic categories in the census will negatively impact the implementation and monitoring of affirmative action programs. Her criticism of the new system's potential to dilute the political power of ethnic communities and her suggestion that socio-economic indicators might be a better basis for such programs indicate that she sees affirmative action as a necessary measure to address racial injustices. Clark's advocacy for a clearer approach to racial classification to support affirmative action goals suggests that she is in favor of these programs but is critical of the government's approach that may hinder their effectiveness.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark criticizes the U.S. government's handling of racial and ethnic classification in the 2000 census, which introduced 57 multiethnic categories. She argues that the new classification system complicates affirmative action and race-based programs by making it difficult to monitor and legislate them. Clark suggests that the census data, which she views as invalid and confusing, serves conservative political agendas rather than promoting cultural pluralism. She also contends that the new categories dilute the political power of ethnic communities by dividing them into many groups, while white Americans are not required to subdivide their identities similarly. Clark questions the criteria for multiethnic classification, especially for African Americans with mixed heritage, and points out the potential for the new system to undermine ethnic community voting blocs. She proposes abandoning race identification in favor of socio-economic indicators, and until the government clarifies the need for the new categories, she advises ethnic groups to adhere to traditional race categories.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Felicia Clark, views affirmative action and race-based programs as important tools for addressing past racial injustices. She is concerned that the new multiethnic categories introduced in the census will hinder the effectiveness of such programs. Clark believes that the confusing and potentially misleading data resulting from these categories will make it more challenging to implement and enforce affirmative action policies. She implies that the move to expand ethnic categorization may be a politically motivated effort to weaken the political influence of minority groups and to avoid confronting historical racial discrimination. Clark advocates for a clearer and more straightforward approach to racial classification that supports the goals of affirmative action rather than complicating or undermining them."	0.024279999999999996	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	1
0	strongly_against	The author, Edwin A. Locke, exhibits a clear stance against affirmative action, as evidenced by his criticism of the new admissions policies that he views as a means to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions. He is concerned that affirmative action undermines objectivity and fairness, and he is skeptical about the non-politicized and non-racial implementation of the new guidelines. Locke's argument that the changes are driven by an ideological commitment to egalitarianism rather than merit, and his belief that this will harm academic competence, further demonstrate his opposition to affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the University of California Board of Regents' new admissions policies, which will consider factors beyond academic qualifications, such as athletic or artistic ability and overcoming poverty. The author argues that the true aim is to remove fairness and objectivity from the admissions process, criticizing the downgrading of standardized tests like the SAT, which are deemed objective and fair. The author expresses skepticism that the new policies will be non-politicized and non-racial, citing a recent vote by the regents to drop a ban on affirmative action despite state law prohibiting it. The author believes the new subjective guidelines will prevent academically qualified students from challenging admissions decisions in court and contends that the real motive behind the changes is egalitarianism, which undermines the concept of academic competence.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Edwin A. Locke, is critical of affirmative action and the new admissions policies that he perceives as a veiled attempt to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions. He views affirmative action as a means to subvert objectivity and fairness in the university admissions process. Locke argues that by de-emphasizing standardized testing and introducing subjective criteria, the university can obscure its selection process and evade legal challenges from students who feel discriminated against on the basis of race. He suggests that the regents' actions are ideologically driven, aiming to promote egalitarianism rather than merit, and believes that this approach will ultimately harm both the students and the universities by devaluing academic competence."	0.02504	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author of the text provides a historical overview of various Chief Justices and their impact on the U.S. Supreme Court, including Rehnquist's conservative stance on civil rights. While the text does not explicitly state the author's personal perspective on affirmative action, it does critique Rehnquist's lack of clarity and guiding principles in his handling of affirmative action cases, suggesting a view that the court's approach under Rehnquist was unpredictable and potentially problematic. However, since the author's own stance on affirmative action is not directly stated, it is not possible to definitively categorize their perspective based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of various Chief Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, highlighting the significance of John Marshall's establishment of judicial review and Earl Warren's rulings on racial equality and defendants' rights. William H. Rehnquist's tenure on the court is characterized by a mixed legacy, with a conservative stance on civil rights, states' rights, and a narrow view of congressional authority. Despite his opposition, decisions like Roe vs. Wade and the constitutional ban on school prayer still stand. Rehnquist's court is noted for narrowing protections for criminal suspects and minorities while striking down federal laws based on a limited interpretation of the commerce clause. The text also mentions Rehnquist's controversial role in the Bush vs. Gore decision and the potential implications of his replacement on the court's future direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their perspective on affirmative action but provides insight into Chief Justice Rehnquist's approach to the topic. Rehnquist's tenure is marked by a lack of clarity in his opinions regarding affirmative action, leading to unpredictability in how the court might rule on such programs. The author suggests that Rehnquist's opinions often focus on the specific facts of a case rather than articulating guiding principles, which contributes to the uncertainty. This implies a critique of Rehnquist's handling of affirmative action cases, as it lacks a clear, guiding judicial philosophy that could provide consistency and predictability in this contentious area of law."	0.02905	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, David Gelernter, expresses a critical view of affirmative action, implying that it may be outdated and no longer necessary. His comments suggest that affirmative action is part of what he perceives as the Democrats' resistance to progress and change. While he does not explicitly state his complete opposition to the policy, his implication that it should be reconsidered or potentially abolished indicates that he leans towards being against it.	"Summary:
In this text, Yale professor David Gelernter criticizes Senator Charles Schumer for his comments about the ""hard, hard right"" of the Republican Party wanting to revert to past eras. Gelernter argues that there has been a ""Big Switch"" in American politics, with Democrats now representing reactionary liberalism and Republicans being the progressives. He accuses Democrats of stalling progress, such as filibustering judicial nominees and opposing initiatives like school vouchers and Social Security reform. Gelernter suggests Democrats are undemocratic, preferring judicial over popular decisions on issues like gay marriage. He also questions the continued necessity of affirmative action, implying that it may be outdated. Gelernter concludes by stating that the current political landscape can only be understood by recognizing this ideological swap.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, appears to be critical of affirmative action, suggesting that it may no longer be necessary after 30 years of implementation. He points out that there are tenured professors who have never known a world without affirmative action, implying that it has been in place for a sufficiently long time. Gelernter's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is a part of the Democrats' resistance to change and their adherence to the status quo, which he views negatively. He presents it as an example of the Democrats' approach of ""Hands off!"" to any proposed changes to long-standing policies, regardless of the current societal context."	0.024980000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author, James Kirchick, expresses a critical view of affirmative action, pointing out its negative consequences such as the devaluation of the achievements of those it is supposed to help. He identifies contradictions within liberal support for affirmative action, particularly when such supporters criticize Clarence Thomas, who has benefited from affirmative action but opposes it. Kirchick empathizes with Thomas's opposition to the policy and uses his own identity to illustrate the potential harm in using personal characteristics as factors in professional advancement. The author argues against the notion that individuals should be labeled as products of affirmative action, implying that the policy can lead to stereotyping and undermine individual merit. Given these points, Kirchick's stance is critical of affirmative action and its implications.	"Summary:
James Kirchick, a member of the editorial staff at The New Republic, discusses the criticism directed at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in light of his memoir, ""My Grandfather's Son."" Critics have labeled Thomas as an ""affirmative action hire,"" questioning his competence and suggesting his appointment to the Supreme Court was solely due to his race. Liberal columnists like Eugene Robinson and Anna Quindlen have echoed these sentiments. However, Kirchick calls out the hypocrisy of liberals who support affirmative action yet disparage Thomas, a supposed beneficiary of such policies. Thomas, who opposes affirmative action based on personal beliefs and its negative impact on black Americans, has faced accusations of hypocrisy for benefiting from the very policies he criticizes. Kirchick argues that affirmative action can devalue the achievements of black professionals and that Thomas's critics treat him unfairly, stripping him of his individuality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author criticizes affirmative action, highlighting its unintended consequences, such as the devaluation of achievements by those it intends to help. He points out the inconsistency in liberal thinking when they use the same arguments against Thomas that they condemn when used by conservatives to critique affirmative action. The author suggests that affirmative action perpetuates stereotypes and undermines the individuality of its beneficiaries. Kirchick also empathizes with Thomas's perspective, drawing a parallel with his own identity as a gay man and how he would feel if sexual orientation were used as a factor in professional or academic selection processes. He contends that the policy can lead to personal insecurity and shame among those it aims to assist. Ultimately, Kirchick believes that affirmative action is a flawed system that privileges individuals based on skin color, and he challenges the notion that Thomas's critics have the right to label him as a product of such a system."	0.031560000000000005	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	1
	None	Kimberly West-Faulcon's perspective on affirmative action, as described in the summary, suggests that she views the topic as being used for political posturing rather than genuine debate on its merits. While she does not explicitly state her personal stance on affirmative action, her criticism of Republican senators for using the issue to appeal to fears suggests that she may be disapproving of their stance against it. However, since the summary does not provide a clear indication of her personal beliefs in favor of affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize her as 'strongly in favor' or 'somewhat in favor'. Her focus seems to be more on the misuse of the issue for political gain rather than on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination, Republicans emphasized national security, the deficit, the right to bear arms, and warned against judicial activism. Sotomayor maintained a moderate profile and stressed an open-minded approach to legal issues. Legal analysts provided mixed reactions to her performance.

Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, felt the hearings allowed senators to address their constituents and the public to see Sotomayor but didn't reveal how she would act as a justice. He noted her conservative-leaning statements, such as rejecting foreign law in U.S. decision-making and describing the Constitution as static.

Ilya Shapiro, a Cato Institute senior fellow, criticized Sotomayor for being evasive, saying she said a lot without giving substantial answers, and was less favorable towards her after the hearing.

Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, observed that the hearings focused on identity politics and affirmative action, with Republican senators using the platform to push their ideology. She praised Sotomayor for coming across as a moderate and restrained judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Kimberly West-Faulcon discussed affirmative action in the context of the hearings, suggesting that Republican senators were using the topic as a wedge issue to appeal to white Americans' fears about nonwhites in authority. She indicated that the hearings were less about evaluating Sotomayor and more about the senators promoting their legal philosophy and ideology concerning affirmative action. West-Faulcon's perspective implies a critical view of the Republicans' approach to affirmative action, seeing it as a tool for political maneuvering rather than a substantive discussion on the nominee's qualifications or judicial philosophy."	0.028059999999999998	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes affirmative action for only assisting a subset of the black community, exacerbating class divisions, and causing division among ethnic groups. The author suggests that affirmative action does not address the needs of the most disadvantaged and calls for broader economic reforms. This criticism indicates that the author is not in favor of affirmative action as it currently stands and believes it fails to address the root issues of economic disparity and class conflict.	"Summary:
The text discusses the causes of the Miami riot, suggesting that while racial discrimination played a role, the deeper issue was class conflict. The author contrasts the Miami riot with earlier race riots, noting that it involved widespread destruction of property, regardless of the owner's race. The concept of ""relative deprivation"" is introduced, explaining that violence can arise when people see others around them improving their conditions while they remain stagnant. The author points out that a growing class gap within urban black communities has emerged, with a significant black middle class developing, but with little change for the lower class. The text criticizes affirmative action, arguing that while it has helped some black Americans, it creates division among ethnic groups and does not address the needs of the most disadvantaged. The author calls for targeted programs to ensure full employment and reform the welfare system but notes that these are being cut from the federal budget, warning of the ongoing risk of urban racial unrest.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, viewing it as a well-intentioned but ultimately flawed strategy that exacerbates class divisions within the black community and provokes backlash among other ethnic groups and working-class whites. The author believes that affirmative action benefits only a small portion of the black community—those who can attend college and compete for high-level jobs—while leaving the most disadvantaged segments unaffected. The perspective suggests that affirmative action is a race-conscious policy that does not address the broader, structural economic issues that contribute to racial inequality, such as the scarcity of good blue-collar jobs and the competition for low-paying service jobs. The author advocates for more inclusive programs that directly target the needs of the poorest blacks, aiming for full employment and welfare reform."	0.0281	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be critical of the Reagan Administration's approach to federal programs aimed at assisting disadvantaged groups, including affirmative action. The criticism of Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action and the concern over the appointment of individuals who are not aligned with the goals of the Legal Services Corporation and the EEOC indicate that the author values affirmative action policies. The use of phrases like 'letting foxes guard chickens' and describing the appointments as 'direct insults' to various groups shows a clear disapproval of actions that may harm the effectiveness of affirmative action. Therefore, the author seems to be in support of affirmative action and is critical of those who oppose it.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for its apparent attempts to undermine the effectiveness of federal programs designed to help disadvantaged groups. It suggests that there is someone within the Administration who is sabotaging its efforts, as evidenced by controversial personnel choices. Ronald Zumbrun, known for opposing the Legal Services Corporation, has been selected to lead the very program he has criticized, which provides legal aid to those who cannot afford it. William Bell, with no notable achievements in management or civil rights, has been nominated to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author argues these appointments are akin to letting foxes guard chickens and views them as direct insults to the poor, legal profession, and workers of any race or sex.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Reagan Administration's stance and actions towards it. The text mentions Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to government regulation, clean water standards, and affirmative action, implying that his selection to head the Legal Services Corporation is a move against the interests of those who benefit from affirmative action policies. The author seems to support affirmative action and views Zumbrun's preference for helping corporations over individuals as a negative stance, particularly for someone who would be in charge of a program that is supposed to provide legal aid to the needy. The tone of the text suggests that the author believes the Administration's personnel choices are detrimental to the advancement of affirmative action and the protection of civil rights."	0.02246	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	1
	None	The text provided does not address the author's views on affirmative action. The focus is on financial and ethical critiques of the Westway project, and while affirmative action consultants are mentioned in the context of expenditures, this does not reflect the author's stance on affirmative action as a policy. The author's views on affirmative action cannot be determined from this text alone.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of the financial aspects of the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. The project's cost has escalated from an estimated $1.4 billion to over $4 billion. The author reports that $75 million has already been spent on preliminary planning and construction, with 90% of the funds coming from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and the remainder from the state. A detailed accounting of expenditures is provided, listing payments to various engineering firms, consultants, legal services, and construction companies. The author expresses opposition to the Westway project, considering it a luxury and a boondoggle inappropriate in times of budget constraints. The author suggests that a more modest replacement for the West Side Highway would be preferable, with savings allocated to mass transit rehabilitation. Additionally, the author raises ethical concerns about two of the project's recipients, System Design Concepts and Beveridge & Diamond, who were admonished by a federal judge for providing ""false responses"" and having ""an intent to misrepresent.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text provided. The text mentions a joint venture between R.T.P. Inc./Boone, Young & Associates Inc. as affirmative action consultants, who received $976,172, but does not elaborate on the author's stance regarding affirmative action policies. The focus of the text is on the financial management and ethical considerations of the Westway project rather than on affirmative action as a policy issue. If the author has any views on affirmative action, they would need to be gleaned from other texts or statements where they directly address the topic."	0.02896	affirmative action	txt/424505995.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text criticizes Morris Abram's strict neutrality stance on affirmative action and opposes his view that affirmative action should not favor any group. The author references historical and institutional racism and supports the viewpoint that affirmative action is necessary to redress past wrongs. They advocate for affirmative action policies that include accountability measures but reject rigid quotas, suggesting that institutions should actively seek and support minority candidates. The author's reference to Justice Blackmun's opinion and President Johnson's speech indicates a belief in the importance of considering race to achieve equality and that more than just freedom and equal opportunity is needed to overcome the effects of centuries of racism. This positions the author as being in favor of affirmative action, specifically a form that actively addresses historical injustices without imposing fixed numerical outcomes.	"Summary:
The text reflects on a moment when President Lyndon Johnson expressed frustration at being unfavorably compared to John F. Kennedy regarding civil rights. Johnson's legacy on civil rights and affirmative action was brought to the fore during Morris Abram's testimony for his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Abram, an opponent of bigotry, holds a strict view on affirmative action, believing it should be neutral and not favor any group, equating affirmative action with quotas which he deeply opposes. The author contrasts Abram's stance with the realities of historical and institutional racism, and references Justice Blackmun's opinion in the Bakke case, arguing for the necessity of considering race to achieve equality. The author suggests that affirmative action, with accountability measures but not rigid quotas, is necessary to redress past wrongs. The author concludes by disagreeing with Abram's interpretation of Johnson's views on affirmative action, citing Johnson's speech at Howard University that highlighted the need for more than just freedom and equal opportunity to overcome the disadvantages caused by centuries of racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of Morris Abram's perspective on affirmative action, which is described as ""technical, bloodless, uncharacteristically ungenerous."" The author disagrees with Abram's strict neutrality and his opposition to any form of preferential treatment or quotas in affirmative action policies. The author believes that affirmative action should be more than just neutral social assistance; it should actively work to create opportunities and redress historical injustices. The author supports the idea of accountability in affirmative action without necessarily imposing fixed numerical outcomes, suggesting that institutions should demonstrate their efforts to find and support minority candidates.

The author also implies that affirmative action is an essential tool for achieving true equality by referencing Justice Blackmun's opinion and President Johnson's speech at Howard University. The author strongly suggests that simply providing freedom and equal opportunity is not sufficient to overcome the systemic disadvantages faced by minorities due to long-standing racism and discrimination. The author argues that affirmative action must take into account these historical contexts to be effective and just."	0.03263	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	1
	None	The text provided does not address affirmative action or provide any indicators of the author's stance on the subject. It focuses on international relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not discussed or relevant to the content of the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political climate of the United States and the Soviet Union, focusing on the internal dynamics that will shape their foreign policies. With the death of Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet leader is expected to be cautious, and there is little incentive for the Soviet Union to take steps that might aid Ronald Reagan's re-election unless his victory seems certain. This situation makes it unlikely for any major issues dividing the superpowers to be resolved within the year. The author suggests that both nations should avoid provocative actions and instead send signals indicating a willingness to engage diplomatically. The author highlights the potential impact of the Soviet Union easing up on dissident repression, specifically mentioning the cases of Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Shcharansky. Additionally, the text critiques President Reagan's aggressive rhetoric towards the Soviet Union and cites Malcolm Toon, a former U.S. Ambassador, who emphasizes the need for clear intentions in American foreign policy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action or the author's perspective on it. Affirmative action refers to policies that support members of disadvantaged groups that have previously suffered discrimination within a culture. Instead, the text focuses on international relations, particularly between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and does not delve into domestic policies like affirmative action. Therefore, the author's views on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided."	0.02539	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective is conveyed through the positive portrayal of the FBI's response to discrimination and the emphasis on the moral imperative for the agency to adhere to civil rights laws internally. The support for the new measures implemented by Director Sessions and the recognition of affirmative action as a tool for promoting equal treatment suggest that the author is in favor of affirmative action. The author seems to appreciate the steps taken to include minority agents in the promotion process and to appoint new management to oversee these efforts, which reflects a belief in the effectiveness of affirmative action policies. However, since the author also notes that the success of these actions remains to be seen, it suggests a cautious optimism rather than an unqualified endorsement.	"Summary:
The text addresses the issue of discrimination within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the steps taken by Director William Sessions to address these concerns through affirmative action. Sessions acknowledged the failure of previous efforts to ensure equal treatment of minority employees and made changes, including removing the director in charge of these efforts and appointing a new manager from outside the FBI. Additionally, he announced that black and Hispanic agents would be included on the bureau's internal promotion boards. This response came after a Federal judge ruled the FBI had discriminated against Hispanic agents and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission upheld a complaint by Donald Rochon, a black agent who faced harassment. The urgency for effective remedies is underscored by the FBI's role in enforcing civil rights laws, highlighting the need for the agency to adhere to these laws internally.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary response to the discrimination found within the FBI. The text implies that affirmative action measures are not just a formal requirement but a moral imperative, especially for an agency responsible for upholding civil rights laws. The author seems to view the steps taken by Director Sessions as a positive development, signaling a commitment to improvement, but also suggests that the success of these actions remains to be seen. The tone indicates that the author believes in the importance of affirmative action as a tool for promoting equal treatment and rectifying past injustices within organizations."	0.020399999999999998	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not directly discuss affirmative action in the common context of policies supporting disadvantaged groups. The term appears only in relation to a budgetary process and does not provide insight into the author's stance on affirmative action as a social policy. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
The text is a satirical commentary on the perceived slow and cautious approach of President Bush's administration, as told through a humorous anecdote involving Bush being knocked unconscious and waking up years later to a report of national stability from his Chief of Staff, John Sununu. The author visits Sununu to understand this approach and discuss a new phrase, ""enhanced rescission,"" which refers to a method of budget control that could increase executive power. Sununu's behavior during the interview is described as both shrewd and insecure. The author also reflects on the Bush administration's strategies, contrasting them with Reagan's, and questions whether Sununu and budgeteer Dick Darman can successfully increase executive authority.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly discuss affirmative action in the text provided. The phrase ""affirmative action"" appears only in the context of a budgetary term ""affirmative legislative action,"" which refers to the need for Congress to actively agree to rescind parts of appropriations. The term ""affirmative action"" in its more common context, referring to policies that support members of disadvantaged groups, is not addressed in the text, and therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action in that sense cannot be discerned from this excerpt."	0.024759999999999997	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Julian Bond, uses satire to criticize the media's portrayal of civil rights organizations and to highlight the absurdity of arguments against affirmative action. His use of sarcasm and irony, especially in discussing the misrepresentation of the NAACP and the trivialization of affirmative action's benefits, suggests that he is in favor of affirmative action. Bond's focus on the importance of affirmative action in addressing racial inequalities and his critique of the media's negative stereotypes indicate that he supports affirmative action and sees it as a necessary tool for social justice.	"Summary:
The text appears to be a satirical memo written by Julian Bond, a former member of the NAACP board of directors and a professor of history and politics. The memo is addressed to journalists and pundits and is prompted by the news that a large number of people have applied to replace Benjamin Hooks as the executive director of the NAACP, with Jesse Jackson being a speculated leading candidate. The memo sarcastically suggests that the media should work harder to promote the perception that the NAACP and civil rights leadership are outdated and disconnected from the black community. It offers a series of story ideas that play into this narrative, advising the use of terms like ""venerable"" and ""geriatric"" and encouraging the avoidance of facts that would show the NAACP in a positive light. The memo mocks the media's tendency to misrepresent the NAACP's position and influence, and it ironically suggests ways to perpetuate negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the organization and its work.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the sarcastic tone of the memo. Bond seems to be criticizing those who oppose affirmative action by highlighting the absurdity of their arguments. He points out that some people argue against affirmative action by claiming it robs recipients of their pride or makes them feel bad, and he notes the irony of not questioning whether whites who receive preferential treatment feel the same way. The memo implies that these arguments are outdated and recycled from past civil rights battles, suggesting that the author sees affirmative action as a necessary and positive force that continues to be relevant and beneficial for addressing racial inequalities. Bond's satirical approach indicates his disapproval of the media's role in perpetuating negative and misleading narratives about affirmative action and civil rights organizations like the NAACP."	0.027110000000000002	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt	1
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of 'The Bell Curve' and its authors' stance on affirmative action, suggesting that their call to abolish affirmative action is based on outdated and discredited ideas. The criticism indicates that the author of the text does not support the book's conclusions and is skeptical of the motives behind the book's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein, which has sparked controversy due to its examination of racial differences in IQ scores. The authors suggest that the lower average IQ scores of black people compared to white people are a significant issue, leading to policy recommendations such as the abolition of affirmative action and welfare. The text criticizes the book for rehashing old and incendiary pseudo-scientific ideas, particularly those of William Shockley, who made similar claims about genetics and intelligence decades earlier. The book is accused of being more about marketing and political agenda than contributing new scientific insights or practical solutions to social issues. It is also noted that the book includes disclaimers, summaries, and graphs to appear authoritative, and it is marketed in a way that caters to different levels of readership. The author of the text suggests that despite its marketing strategy, ""The Bell Curve"" may not resonate in a culture that celebrates figures like the fictional character Forrest Gump, who is portrayed as having a low IQ but is still revered.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text seems critical of ""The Bell Curve"" authors' stance on affirmative action. The text implies that the book's call to abolish affirmative action is based on outdated and discredited ideas linking race, genetics, and intelligence. The author suggests that the book's perspective on affirmative action is part of a conservative political agenda rather than a thoughtful or scientifically supported policy recommendation. The criticism of the book's approach to this issue indicates that the author of the text is skeptical of the motives and arguments behind the book's stance on affirmative action and does not support the book's conclusions on this matter."	0.02731	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt	1
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly expressed in terms of support or opposition to the policy itself. Instead, the author uses Bob Dole's changing stance on affirmative action as an example of Dole's broader character flaw of indecisiveness and lack of consistent leadership. The author's focus is on criticizing Dole's political maneuvering and inconsistency, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the central concern of the text, and the author's own views on the policy cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses Bob Dole's indecisiveness during his presidential campaign, particularly in relation to attacking Bill Clinton's character and administration ethics. At 73 years old, Dole is portrayed as hesitant to get tougher on Clinton, questioning whether to do so in a New Jersey event. He ultimately decides to confront Clinton in a town-hall debate, a difficult setting for aggressive tactics, with the election only weeks away. The author criticizes Dole for his vacillation and suggests it has given Clinton a free pass while highlighting Dole's own character issues. Dole's history of equivocation on various topics, including his stances on affirmative action and supply-side economics, is seen as damaging to his credibility as a leader. The text implies that Dole's inability to take firm positions and confront his opponents weakens his presidential campaign and raises doubts about his leadership capabilities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears critical of Bob Dole's stance on affirmative action, citing it as an example of his tendency to reverse his positions. Dole is described as having abandoned his long-standing support for affirmative action in an attempt to align himself with Ronald Reagan's legacy and appeal to certain voter bases. This reversal is presented as a self-destructive move and an indication of Dole's lack of steadfastness in his convictions. The author uses Dole's flip-flopping on affirmative action to underscore a broader argument about Dole's character flaws, particularly his lack of consistency and leadership. The perspective suggests that Dole's shift on affirmative action is not a principled decision but rather a political maneuver, which contributes to the portrayal of Dole as a compromised and indecisive candidate."	0.02859	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat in favor, as indicated by the criticism of the Republican Party's focus on ending affirmative action without offering a plausible alternative. The author sees affirmative action as a necessary measure to address racial inequalities and implies that its removal would be irresponsible and harmful without a proper replacement. The mention of needing 'a just reform of affirmative action' suggests that the author may see room for improvement in affirmative action policies but does not support their outright abolition.	"Summary:
The text discusses the U.S. Congress's consideration of a bill to apologize for slavery, with some opposition from figures like Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich. The author criticizes this gesture as symbolic rather than substantive, suggesting that what is needed is real change, not apologies. The article highlights the Republican focus on ending affirmative action and the lack of substantial alternatives to address racial inequalities. It also criticizes President Clinton's approach to racial policy as being more about public relations than concrete action. The author suggests that instead of symbolic gestures, the government should be working with mayors to address the crises of race and poverty with credible, effective programs.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it should not be abolished without providing a safety net for the poor. The author criticizes the Republican Party's focus on ending affirmative action as a popular stance in polls but points out that the party lacks a plausible alternative that would be acceptable to key figures within the party who have credibility on racial issues and support a just reform of affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is a necessary measure to address racial inequalities and that its removal without a proper replacement would be irresponsible and harmful."	0.02332	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author describes Albert Carnesale's perspective as one that values diversity as a fundamental goal in education, with affirmative action being a tool to achieve this diversity. Carnesale's advocacy for diversity in the educational environment, his belief in its importance for a high-quality education, and his efforts to engage with strategies to maintain diversity despite legal limitations suggest a strong support for the principles behind affirmative action. His commitment to finding alternative ways to promote diversity within the constraints of Proposition 209 indicates a proactive stance in favor of the objectives of affirmative action, even if the traditional means are currently restricted.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perspective of Albert Carnesale, the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, on the issue of affirmative action and diversity in education. Carnesale emphasizes the importance of diversity as an end goal, with affirmative action being one of the means to achieve it. He highlights the challenges faced by UCLA due to new policies by the Regents of the University of California and Proposition 209, which ban preferences in admissions based on race or ethnicity. These changes have led to a significant drop in the number of Hispanic and black students admitted to and enrolling in UCLA's Law School. Carnesale outlines three reasons why he believes diversity is crucial: it enhances education, prepares leaders for all societal segments, and provides access to social and economic mobility.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Carnesale's perspective as one that strongly supports the pursuit of diversity within the educational environment. Carnesale views diversity as a critical component of a high-quality education, as it allows students to learn from each other's different perspectives. He also sees the role of a public university like UCLA as preparing leaders from all walks of life and promoting social and economic mobility through education.

Carnesale acknowledges the challenges to maintaining diversity in the wake of Proposition 209 and outlines strategies to encourage minority students to apply and enroll. He advocates for increased engagement with high schools to make more minorities eligible for university admission and aspires to equal educational opportunities for all children, despite recognizing that better-off individuals will always have some advantages.

Moreover, Carnesale clarifies that while race, ethnicity, and gender cannot be considered in admissions, universities like UCLA can and do consider other factors beyond academic scores. He gives examples such as extracurricular talents and personal achievements that contribute to the diversity of the student body.

In summary, the author conveys Carnesale's view that diversity is an essential aim for educational institutions and that affirmative action, though currently limited by law, is not the only means to achieve a diverse and enriching educational environment. Carnesale advocates for a broader understanding of diversity that encompasses a variety of student experiences and backgrounds, beyond just test scores and academic records."	0.031689999999999996	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author acknowledges the importance of affirmative action by highlighting its success in the context of General Colin Powell's career, as mentioned by President Clinton. They also recognize the complexity of the topic by mentioning Thernstrom's distinction between affirmative action and racial preferences, implying that a nuanced conversation is necessary. The author does not explicitly advocate for or against affirmative action but instead suggests that it is a topic worthy of deeper discussion. They seem to appreciate the value of affirmative action while also understanding that there are different perspectives that need to be addressed.	"Summary:
President Clinton conducted a national town meeting on race in Akron, Ohio, which was televised and involved discussions with 67 college students, civic leaders, and business people. The event aimed to initiate a broad, national conversation on race. Participants spoke on racial identity, affirmative action, and education, but the conversation remained guarded. The dialogue gained momentum when President Clinton directly addressed Abigail Thernstrom, a panelist critical of affirmative action, asking if she would eliminate affirmative action like that which benefited General Colin Powell. Thernstrom distinguished between affirmative action and racial preferences, a topic that warranted more discussion. The event's energy was subdued, and Clinton was disappointed by the lack of openness. The article suggests that future meetings could be more effective if they were better organized with focused topics and engaging guests.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to recognize the complexity and contentiousness of affirmative action as a topic. They highlight the moment when President Clinton challenges Thernstrom on her views, indicating that this was a critical point in the discussion that could have been explored more deeply. The author implies that affirmative action, as implemented by the Army to help soldiers like General Colin Powell, is a success story worth examining. However, they also acknowledge Thernstrom's point that there is a distinction to be made between affirmative action and racial preferences, suggesting that this nuance is an important part of the conversation that deserves attention. Overall, the author appears to view affirmative action as a significant and effective tool in addressing racial inequality, but also sees the need for a more nuanced and in-depth discussion on its implementation and implications."	0.02237	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Lani Guinier, acknowledges the value of affirmative action for promoting diversity and equality in higher education but also recognizes its challenges and controversies. By highlighting the success of the Texas '10 percent plan' as an alternative that increases diversity without explicitly using race and advocating for strategies that gain broader support, Guinier demonstrates a nuanced perspective. She supports the goals of affirmative action but also seeks more inclusive and less contentious methods to achieve these goals.	"Summary:
The text discusses the implications of affirmative action policies and their alternatives in the context of university admissions in California and Texas. In California, the ban on considering race and ethnicity in public college admissions led to a significant drop in admissions for black, Hispanic, and American Indian students at top universities, raising concerns about resegregation. In contrast, Texas developed the ""10 percent plan"" after a federal court decision against considering race in admissions. This plan automatically admits students in the top 10 percent of their high school class to the state's most selective public universities, regardless of their S.A.T. scores. The result was an increase in admissions for minority and rural white students who typically underperform on standardized tests. Texas has also implemented measures to improve primary education, with accountability for performance across different ethnic and economic groups, leading to a narrowing of the achievement gap.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Lani Guinier, appears to view affirmative action as a valuable tool for promoting diversity and equality in higher education. However, she also acknowledges the challenges and controversies surrounding affirmative action. Guinier highlights the Texas ""10 percent plan"" as a more inclusive and less contentious alternative that has successfully increased diversity and access to education without explicitly using race as a criterion. She suggests that this approach, combined with efforts to improve primary education and a less polarized political environment, can lead to better educational outcomes and a broader public discussion on the issue. Guinier seems to advocate for strategies that promote equal opportunity and diversity while also garnering broader support across different demographic and political groups."	0.025330000000000002	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Henry Louis Gates Jr., acknowledges the positive impact of affirmative action on the growth of the black middle class but also points out the persistence of disparities and the emergence of new forms of disconnectedness. He emphasizes the need for the African-American community to embrace the Internet to avoid 'cybersegregation' and suggests community involvement in teaching technology skills. His perspective shows an understanding of the complexities surrounding affirmative action and recognizes its benefits while also highlighting ongoing challenges that require attention beyond policy measures. Gates does not explicitly state a strong position for or against affirmative action, but he implies that it is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving true equality.	"Summary:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical and contemporary issues of African-American access to literacy and technology. He highlights the importance of literacy as a means of liberation for slaves and notes that the struggle for equal access to education continued after slavery. Gates points out the current gap in access to the digital ""knowledge economy,"" referring to it as ""cybersegregation."" He cites a Commerce Department study showing that income alone does not explain the disparity in computer ownership between white and African-American families. Gates argues that the lack of relevant content on the Internet for African-Americans contributes to this divide and suggests that creating appealing content could help bridge the gap, similar to how ""race records"" did in the music industry.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Gates reflects on the impact of affirmative action, acknowledging the growth of the black middle class since such programs began in the late 1960s. However, he also points out that new forms of disconnectedness have emerged, with middle-class African-Americans feeling isolated from both their white peers and those in the underclass. He suggests that addressing the ""cybersegregation"" issue requires behavioral change within the African-American community, including using resources like churches and community centers to teach technology skills and black history. Gates emphasizes the importance of the Internet as a modern communication tool that African-Americans must embrace to avoid a new form of segregation. He implies that while affirmative action has had positive effects, there is still work to be done by the African-American community to ensure they are not left behind in the digital age."	0.029969999999999997	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's depiction of Richard Barrett's rally against affirmative action as 'anemic' and his interpretation of historical documents as 'racist' indicates a disapproval of Barrett's views. The author's favorable portrayal of the community's inclusive and peaceful gathering, which celebrates diversity and unity, further suggests support for the principles of affirmative action. By contrasting Barrett's negative approach with the community's positive response, the author implicitly endorses the values of equality and diversity that affirmative action seeks to promote. There is a clear disapproval of Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance and an appreciation for the community's stand against his ideology.	"Summary:
Morristown, known for its historical significance during the Revolutionary War, faced a contemporary challenge to its ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Richard Barrett, a white supremacist from Mississippi, obtained legal permission to hold a rally in Morristown, citing the town's history and drawing a parallel between his cause and George Washington's rebellion against monarchical privilege. Barrett's rally, which opposed affirmative action and promoted racist ideology, was met with protective police presence and counter-protests that resulted in pepper spray deployment and arrests. In response to Barrett's divisive presence, the community of Morristown gathered in a show of unity and diversity at the Calvary Baptist Church. The event, which attracted a large crowd, featured multi-faith prayers and celebrated racial harmony, deliberately omitting Barrett's name while denouncing the notion of racial superiority. The town's mayor had encouraged this peaceful demonstration as an alternative to direct confrontation with Barrett's group.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance, describing his protest as ""anemic"" and his interpretation of the Declaration of Independence as ""racist."" The author contrasts Barrett's divisive message with the community's embrace of diversity and unity, highlighting the town's peaceful and inclusive gathering as a rejection of Barrett's ideology. The narrative suggests that the author values the principles of equality and diversity, which are foundational to affirmative action, and views Barrett's perspective as a regressive and unwelcome disturbance to the community's progress toward racial harmony. The author's depiction of the community's response to Barrett's rally underscores a commitment to moving beyond past racial divisions and indicates a belief in the importance of acknowledging and accepting differences as a way to move forward."	0.0298	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's presentation of Dr. Formicola's work in a positive light, highlighting his efforts to increase minority enrollment and access to dental care, suggests a favorable view of affirmative action. The text underscores the impact of affirmative action policies and portrays them as a means to address inequality and fulfill a social responsibility. The author's focus on the success of these initiatives as a means to bridge community gaps indicates a perspective that is supportive of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the efforts of Dr. Allan J. Formicola, who is retiring as the dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery after 23 years. Dr. Formicola is recognized for his significant contributions in increasing minority enrollment at the dental school and expanding access to high-quality dental care in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. His approach involved reaching out to minority alumni and promoting community involvement. His tenure saw the establishment of community health centers, dental clinics in schools, and a mobile dental care unit. Dr. Formicola's work is highlighted as an example of how those in positions of power can address issues of inequality and affirmative action. The article also touches on the historical tension between Columbia University and the surrounding communities, as well as the ongoing challenges in providing adequate dental care to minority neighborhoods. There is hope that the initiatives started by Dr. Formicola will continue after his retirement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a positive view of affirmative action through the example of Dr. Formicola's work. Dr. Formicola is portrayed as someone who actively sought to increase minority representation in the dental field and improve access to dental care in underserved communities. His actions are implied as a response to the broader question of what those with power owe to those less privileged, suggesting an endorsement of affirmative action as a means to address inequality and social responsibility. The author's perspective is that affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully and with commitment, can lead to meaningful change and bridge gaps between communities. The success of Dr. Formicola's initiatives serves as a testament to the potential positive impact of affirmative action policies."	0.027539999999999995	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but there is an implied critique of the insincere and politically motivated support for affirmative action by certain politicians. While the author is critical of the misuse of affirmative action as a tool for political expediency, there is no clear indication of the author's stance on the policy itself. The criticism is more focused on the political manipulation surrounding the issue rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is best described as neutral, with a strong emphasis on the importance of sincerity and effectiveness in its implementation.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on the political fallout following then-Senator Trent Lott's controversial remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, where Lott seemed to endorse Thurmond's segregationist past. The author describes Lott's subsequent attempts to make amends by supporting affirmative action and other racially sensitive measures, actions which the author views as disingenuous and politically motivated. The broader issue, as the author sees it, is the hypocrisy and cynicism within both political parties and the media, who used Lott as a scapegoat to avoid addressing systemic racism and their own complicity in it. The author also criticizes the Republican Party for its history of using race as a political tool, while also pointing out the failure of the Democratic Party and the media to call out such behavior consistently.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author is critical of Trent Lott's sudden and seemingly insincere endorsement of ""across the board"" affirmative action, suggesting that it was a desperate political maneuver rather than a genuine commitment to racial equality. The author also critiques President Bush's ""affirmative access"" as ineffective, implying skepticism about the Republican Party's approach to affirmative action and racial justice. The text suggests that the author views affirmative action as a policy that should be genuinely and effectively implemented, rather than used as a public relations strategy or a superficial remedy to appease critics after a scandal."	0.03734	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, James O. Freedman, is described as a 'strong supporter of affirmative action.' He has actively contributed to supporting affirmative action policies, including helping prepare a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in favor of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. His belief that the future of America depends on the education of minority men and women, along with his efforts to make Dartmouth College more inclusive, clearly indicates his strong advocacy for affirmative action.	"Summary:
James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth College, staunchly advocates for the value of a liberal education despite criticism that it is impractical. He believes that liberal education is essential for understanding oneself, developing a moral compass, and gaining insights into how society and democracies function. In his book, ""Liberal Education and the Public Interest,"" Freedman argues that the skills gained from a liberal education—such as writing and critical thinking—are highly valuable in the job market over a long career. Despite undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Freedman remains focused on writing and promoting liberal values. He has also been active in supporting affirmative action and creating a welcoming environment for diverse students at Dartmouth. His contributions extend beyond academia, as seen in his efforts to combat campus intolerance and his advisory role to fellow academics.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
James O. Freedman is a strong supporter of affirmative action. He believes that the future of America relies on the education of minority men and women, and he has put this belief into action by helping prepare a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. His advocacy for affirmative action is consistent with his broader commitment to liberal education and diversity, as evidenced by his efforts to make Dartmouth College more inclusive during his presidency. Freedman views affirmative action as a necessary measure to ensure that educational opportunities are accessible to all segments of society, which he sees as critical to the nation's success."	0.03102	affirmative action	txt/432317583.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as indicated by the description of Justice O'Connor's potential support for the University of Michigan's policies. The author acknowledges O'Connor's conservative background but emphasizes her nuanced legal approach and concern for the societal impact of court decisions. The mention of O'Connor's personal experiences with gender discrimination and the implication that these experiences might lead her to empathize with beneficiaries of affirmative action further suggests that the author views affirmative action as a positive force for overcoming barriers and promoting inclusion.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's consideration of cases against the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies in admissions. Kirk Kolbo, representing the plaintiffs, argued that affirmative action violates the Constitution, but faced skepticism from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who highlighted the complexities of precedent and the non-absolute nature of the issue. The cases had significant momentum and attention, with protests outside the court. Justice O'Connor, known for her pivotal swing vote and conservative yet occasionally moderate stance, seemed to be leaning towards preserving affirmative action based on her questions and legal history.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author portrays Justice O'Connor as a potentially unlikely defender of affirmative action. Despite her conservative background and some decisions that have been perceived as callous or unsympathetic to certain groups, the author suggests that O'Connor's nuanced approach to the law and her attention to the real-world impacts of court rulings may lead her to support the University of Michigan's policies. The author notes that O'Connor has often been averse to overturning major precedents and has demonstrated a concern for the effects of legal decisions on people's lives.

The text also hints at a personal connection that may influence O'Connor's view: her own experience with gender discrimination and her appointment to the Supreme Court, which was partially a result of a political promise to appoint a woman, akin to affirmative action. The author suggests that O'Connor might empathize with minority applicants who benefit from affirmative action, seeing a reflection of her own path to success that involved overcoming barriers and seizing opportunities provided by intentional acts of inclusion."	0.02911	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the Jayson Blair scandal but defends the principle of diversity in journalism, implying that affirmative action is a valuable tool to achieve this diversity. By countering the conservative criticism of affirmative action in the context of the scandal and emphasizing the importance of advancing underrepresented groups, the author shows a supportive stance towards affirmative action. The defense of diversity and the suggestion that the incident should not detract from the broader goals indicate that the author is in favor of affirmative action, but the text does not provide enough evidence to suggest a 'strongly in favor' stance.	"Summary:
The text is an email discussing the reaction to the scandal involving Jayson Blair at The New York Times. Blair, a young black reporter, committed repeated acts of deceit and plagiarism, which is considered a low point in the paper's history. The scandal has prompted an investigation and introspection within the newspaper, with the executive editor, Howell Raines, committed to transparency and preventing such issues in the future. The scandal has elicited reactions in Washington, with liberals disappointed and conservatives experiencing schadenfreude. The author defends The Times' editorial independence and argues that diversity in journalism is valuable despite the incident with Blair.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that conservatives are using the scandal to criticize affirmative action, arguing that Blair was promoted due to his minority status rather than merit, which they believe led to the situation. However, the author counters this by emphasizing the importance of diversity in the media and suggesting that The Times and other media outlets are justified in supporting the advancement of black journalists and other underrepresented groups. The author seems to believe that while the Jayson Blair incident is regrettable, it should not be used to undermine the broader goals of diversity and opportunity in journalism."	0.02411	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to take a neutral stance on affirmative action. They present multiple viewpoints and acknowledge the complexity of the issue without advocating for a specific position. The summary includes arguments both for and against affirmative action, as well as the notion that it may be a temporary solution. The author also discusses the broader context of educational disparities that affirmative action seeks to address, indicating an understanding that the policy is part of a larger debate about educational equality. The neutrality comes from the balanced discussion of the benefits and criticisms of affirmative action, without a clear endorsement or rejection of the policy.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court decision, with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion, upheld affirmative action in university admissions but suggested a 25-year sunset clause, implying that racial preferences would eventually become unnecessary. The decision raises questions about the future of affirmative action, educational equality, and how to close the academic performance gap between white and minority students. Justice O'Connor expressed optimism in an interview that educational improvements could eliminate the need for affirmative action. Disparities in educational achievement persist, as shown by standardized test scores and graduation rates. Debates continue over school funding, social inequality, and student study habits. While some argue for financial parity in education, others point out the complexity of socioeconomic factors and the inefficacy of increased spending alone. Both sides of the affirmative action debate agree on the need to close the education gap but disagree on methods and the role of affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging the complexity of the issues surrounding it. They highlight the Supreme Court's decision as a temporary approval of affirmative action, with an expectation of its future obsolescence. The author discusses various perspectives, including those who believe financial parity in education is necessary to close the achievement gap and those who argue that money alone cannot solve deeper societal issues. The author also notes the argument that affirmative action benefits primarily middle-income students and may act as a bridge rather than an elevator for socioeconomic advancement.

The author suggests that while affirmative action is seen by some as a necessary measure to ensure diversity and opportunity for minority students, it is also viewed by others as a distraction from addressing fundamental educational disparities. The text implies that affirmative action alone cannot fix the education system and that a broader commitment from society and minority families is required. The author also reflects on the demographic changes in college campuses and the potential implications for the debate on affirmative action.

Overall, the author's perspective seems to recognize the temporary nature of affirmative action as envisioned by the Supreme Court, the need for substantive educational reforms, and the ongoing debate over how best to achieve equality in educational opportunities."	0.04279	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is positive, as they view the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it as a good development and align with a national consensus. The author appreciates the moderate stance of the Court and seems to support affirmative action as a means to promote diversity and equality in educational opportunities. The mention of the Court's balance and the mainstream approach to affirmative action suggests that the author is in favor of the policy, but the article does not contain strong language or advocacy that would indicate a 'strongly in favor' position. Instead, the author seems to appreciate the policy as part of a moderate and balanced legal approach.	"Summary:
The article discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions that have surprised many due to their moderate stance, despite expectations of a more conservative approach given the majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents. The Court upheld affirmative action in university admissions, protected gay sexual relations constitutionally, and supported state workers' rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, it failed to protect the marginalized in some cases, such as upholding California's ""three strikes"" law. The author notes the Court's ideological spectrum, with a far-right presence but no equivalent push from the left. The article concludes by warning that the appointment of an extreme conservative justice could significantly alter the balance of the Court and impact key issues like environmental protection, affirmative action, and abortion rights.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action as a positive development, aligning with a national consensus that race can be considered in university admissions but without strict quotas. The author suggests that the Court's decision reflects a moderate and mainstream approach to affirmative action, which is seen as a balanced and reasonable way to address the issue. The author appears to support the principle of affirmative action as a means to promote diversity and equality in educational opportunities. The endorsement of affirmative action by the Court, especially by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who was the swing vote, is presented as a sign that the Court is in touch with the broader sentiments of the American population rather than strictly adhering to a conservative agenda."	0.02616	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author, Sam Tanenhaus, does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The text focuses on the broader political dynamics and ideological battles within the Democratic and Republican parties rather than on specific policy issues. The brief mention of President Bush's varied positions on several issues, including affirmative action, is used to illustrate the complexity of political stances rather than to argue for or against affirmative action explicitly.	"Summary:
Sam Tanenhaus discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, where liberal presidential candidates are facing opposition from moderate party leaders concerned about the party's direction. He contrasts this with the Republican strategy of embracing their passionate base and argues that ideology may not be as decisive in elections as the energy and passion of committed ideologues. Tanenhaus suggests that the Democrats could learn from the Republicans' experience in the 1964 election when Barry Goldwater's conservative candidacy, though unsuccessful, ultimately revitalized the conservative movement and led to future victories. He notes that the parties appear to have swapped identities, with Republicans harnessing their populist activists while Democrats seem wary of their own base.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text provided does not focus extensively on affirmative action, Tanenhaus briefly mentions President Bush's stance on the issue, describing him as ""now a small-government conservative (tax cuts for the rich), now a big-government liberal (prescription drug benefits), now a social liberal (favoring some types of affirmative action), now a social conservative (opposed to gay marriage)."" This suggests that the author acknowledges the complexity and sometimes contradictory nature of political positions, including Bush's selective support for affirmative action. However, Tanenhaus does not provide a deep analysis or personal viewpoint on affirmative action in this text. His main focus is on the broader political strategies and ideological battles within and between the major political parties, rather than on specific policy issues like affirmative action."	0.03009	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt	1
4	strongly_in_favor	Ian Haney Lopez demonstrates a clear support for affirmative action through his critique of the Supreme Court's handling of race-conscious government actions. He argues that the Constitution should combat systemic discrimination and that affirmative action is a necessary measure to promote equality and end racial subordination. His perspective suggests that affirmative action is not equivalent to racist laws but is a tool to dismantle oppressive systems, indicating a stance that is in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor, reflects on the 50th anniversaries of two significant Supreme Court cases: Brown v. Board of Education and Hernandez v. Texas. While Brown is widely recognized for its role in desegregating schools, Lopez argues that Hernandez, which extended constitutional protections to Mexican-Americans, is equally important but often overlooked. He explains that Hernandez addressed the issue of jury discrimination and set a precedent for when the Constitution should prohibit discrimination, which is when groups suffer subordination. The case highlighted the social discrimination against Mexican-Americans in Texas, akin to the Jim Crow practices faced by African Americans. Lopez criticizes the current Supreme Court's interpretation of Brown, suggesting it has distorted the original anti-caste intent and created hurdles for race-conscious government actions, such as affirmative action. He contends that the court fails to address systematic discrimination if it's not explicitly based on race. Lopez suggests that Hernandez, rather than Brown, should be at the forefront of 14th Amendment law focused on ending racial subordination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ian Haney Lopez appears to support affirmative action as a necessary measure to combat systemic discrimination and promote equality. He criticizes the Supreme Court for equating race-conscious government actions, like affirmative action, with the racist laws of the Jim Crow era. Lopez argues that the Constitution should oppose not just the explicit use of racial distinctions by the state but also the more insidious forms of racism that manifest through systematic oppression. By highlighting the misinterpretation of Brown v. Board of Education, he emphasizes the need for a legal framework that recognizes and actively works against racial subordination, which includes supporting affirmative action policies. He believes that affirmative action is not morally or constitutionally equivalent to laws designed to subjugate a race, but rather that it is a tool to dismantle the remnants of such oppressive systems."	0.031	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the information provided. The text is a political quiz that includes a question about President Bush's stance on Supreme Court justices and affirmative action, but it does not offer any insight into the author's own views on the policy. The author's inclusion of the question indicates an awareness of the relevance of affirmative action in political discussions, particularly in the context of Supreme Court justice qualifications, but does not reveal a personal stance.	"Summary:
The text provided is a series of questions and answers that appear to be from a political quiz or trivia related to political events and figures, with a focus on U.S. politics during the time of President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. It covers a variety of topics including statements made by President Bush about Osama bin Laden, a response by John Kerry to a report on IQ comparisons, proposals for Social Security reform, political advertisements, the disappearance of explosives in Iraq, celebrity endorsements in politics, the composition of the coalition in Operation Iraqi Freedom, President Bush's views on Supreme Court justice qualifications, strategies for political campaigning, and a statement by a Democratic politician about the Bush family's influence in Florida. The quiz also asks respondents to identify Hans Blix.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Regarding affirmative action, the author of the quiz includes a question about President Bush's stance on Supreme Court justices. The correct answer indicates that President Bush would find a pro-affirmative action stance unacceptable in a Supreme Court justice (answer 11:d is incorrect; the correct answer is 11:b). This suggests that the author is aware of Bush's conservative position on this issue, which typically involves opposition to affirmative action policies. The inclusion of this question in the quiz indicates that the author considers affirmative action a significant political issue and one that is relevant to the qualifications and beliefs of Supreme Court justices. However, there is no explicit commentary provided on affirmative action beyond this, so the author's personal perspective on the policy is not directly stated."	0.03199	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author does not directly express a personal view on affirmative action but rather focuses on portraying the tension between conservative and liberal perspectives at Harvard University, especially in light of Lawrence Summers' presidency. The text discusses the controversy and the author seems to be more concerned with illustrating the conflict and differences in views among the university stakeholders rather than advocating for or against affirmative action. The summary provided does not contain enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action definitively.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, who suggested that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude. This sparked protests on campus and raised questions about Harvard's identity as liberal or conservative. The debate extends to various issues such as the number of tenured women professors, campus expansion, and the management of Harvard's endowment. Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, is seen as conservative within the university context, pushing for changes like restoring R.O.T.C. to campus and overhauling the core curriculum. His confrontational style has led to clashes with faculty members and accusations of being anti-affirmative action and a dictatorial bully. The text also touches on the broader theme of the culture war affecting universities and the challenge of balancing tradition with inevitable transformation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a picture of Lawrence Summers as someone who is at odds with the traditional liberal stance on affirmative action. Summers is contrasted with his predecessors, Neil Rudenstine and Derek Bok, who were more devoted to inclusivity and affirmative action, respectively. The author describes the conservative view as critical of affirmative action, with Harvey Mansfield attributing Summers' problems to his lack of support for affirmative action. The left, in turn, views Summers as a dictatorial figure imposing his will on the university. The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action but provides a narrative that showcases the tension between conservative and liberal perspectives on the issue within the context of Harvard University."	0.03177	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author contrasts the backgrounds and achievements of McCain and Obama, highlighting McCain's possible benefit from legacy status and Obama's merit-based success. The discussion about Obama not playing the race card and not mentioning his race on his Harvard application suggests a preference for individual merit over race-based affirmative action. However, the focus is on the contrast between legacy admissions and personal achievement rather than a direct commentary on affirmative action policies. The author does not provide a clear endorsement or rejection of affirmative action but rather seems to appreciate meritocracy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the envy and resentment that Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, and John McCain feel towards Barack Obama's rise in the political arena. Clinton is depicted as unable to hide his jealousy, even when questioned about Obama's readiness to be president. Jesse Jackson is portrayed as a civil rights leader who has lost relevance in the wake of Obama's approach to racial equality, which doesn't rely on white guilt. McCain is described as being envious of Obama's youth, popularity, and intellectual appeal, leading him to run a petty campaign that contrasts sharply with his previous image as an honorable politician. The author also suggests that McCain is aware of his own advantages as a legacy admission to Annapolis and is uncomfortable with Obama's success, which was achieved without playing the race card.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred through the contrast drawn between McCain and Obama. The author points out that McCain, who comes from a family of admirals, might have benefited from his legacy status to get through Annapolis, implying that his path may have been eased by a form of affirmative action for the privileged. In contrast, Obama is noted for not even mentioning his race on his Harvard Law School application, suggesting that he achieved his position through merit alone. This comparison implies the author's skepticism towards affirmative action that benefits the already privileged and an appreciation for merit-based success, as exemplified by Obama's achievements."	0.027	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Helene Cooper, reflects positively on the role of affirmative action in creating opportunities for minorities and enabling the rise of a diverse elite, including prominent figures who have led the country. Cooper shares personal experiences that suggest she sees the value in these policies, acknowledging both the opportunities they have provided and the complex experiences of minorities who benefit from them. She discusses the 'double consciousness' that minorities often develop as a result of navigating different cultural spaces, indicating an understanding of the nuanced impact of affirmative action. While Cooper does not shy away from discussing the challenges and pressures that come with being a minority in high positions, her overall discussion leans towards recognizing the positive aspects of affirmative action, without being uncritical.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the impact of affirmative action policies initiated in 1969, when prestigious U.S. universities began actively recruiting minority students. It highlights the rise of a new elite, including figures like Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett, who benefited from these policies. The author, Helene Cooper, shares her personal experience as a beneficiary of affirmative action and discusses the complexities and vulnerabilities that come with being a minority in high positions of power. The text also addresses the broader societal implications of affirmative action, such as the development of a ""double consciousness"" among minority individuals, and the ongoing challenges of addressing race in America.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Helene Cooper presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. She acknowledges its role in creating opportunities for minorities and shaping a new diverse elite that has risen to lead the country. Cooper also shares her personal experiences, including feelings of inadequacy and the pressure to assimilate and navigate a predominantly white environment. The author recognizes the benefits of affirmative action, such as enabling a broader swath of America to identify with leaders like Barack Obama, while also highlighting the complexities and ongoing challenges that minorities face, even after achieving success.

Cooper suggests that affirmative action has been both idealistic, aiming to create a diverse elite better for America, and cynical, as a response to a diversifying country with the need to socialize brighter minorities. She emphasizes the ""double consciousness"" that minority individuals develop, allowing them to move between their ethnic identity and the world opened up by their education. The text implies that while affirmative action has made significant strides in diversifying leadership, it also underscores that being a minority in America, even with high status, is a multifaceted experience fraught with ongoing societal tensions."	0.03727	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt	1
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be positive based on the context in which it is mentioned. The author highlights Liu's support for affirmative action as a reason for Republican opposition, indicating that this support is part of Liu's mainstream legal and political views. By advocating for Liu's confirmation and criticizing Republicans for blocking nominees who support affirmative action, the author implies that affirmative action is a reasonable policy. The author does not express a strong, explicit stance for or against affirmative action, but the overall tone suggests that the author is somewhat in favor of it.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee is revisiting the consideration of nominees for federal judgeships because Senate Republicans previously blocked a full Senate vote and invoked a rule requiring renomination. Among the nominees is Goodwin Liu, a law professor with an impressive background, including a Rhodes Scholarship and a clerkship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Republicans oppose Liu due to his views on same-sex marriage, affirmative action, and the Constitution as a living document. Despite accusations of being a liberal ideologue, Liu's support for school vouchers and charter schools, and endorsements from conservatives like Kenneth Starr, suggest otherwise. The author urges Republican support for Liu and other nominees, noting the lower confirmation rate for President Obama's nominees compared to President Bush's at the same point in their presidencies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be positive, as they mention it as one of the reasons for Republican opposition to Goodwin Liu's nomination. The author suggests that Liu's support for affirmative action is part of what places him within the legal and political mainstream, implying that such support is reasonable and not radical. The author seems to advocate for the confirmation of nominees like Liu, who have mainstream views on issues like affirmative action, and criticizes Republicans for holding up the confirmation of well-qualified candidates based on their support for such policies."	0.02147	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not explicitly express their personal stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. Instead, they focus on Clarence Thomas's experiences and the political implications of his views on affirmative action. The author implies that Thomas's opposition to affirmative action was a contributing factor in the opposition he faced, but the author's own view on the policy is not clearly stated. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined solely based on the information given in the summary.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 1991 controversy surrounding Anita Hill's testimony that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her. The author expresses skepticism about the scandal, questioning the timing of Hill's allegations and whether a liberal African American nominee would have faced similar scrutiny. The piece also discusses recent events where Ginni Thomas, Clarence's wife, left a voicemail for Anita Hill seeking an apology, which reignited public interest in the affair. Furthermore, Lillian McEwen, a former girlfriend of Thomas, has come forward with claims that support Hill's account, coinciding with her memoir release. The author mentions Thomas's personal struggles and transformation as detailed in his memoir and suggests that the renewed controversy is a spiritual battle for Thomas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Clarence Thomas's real ""offense"" was not the alleged sexual harassment but rather his conservative stance on issues like affirmative action. The author implies that Thomas's criticism of affirmative action, which he believed might harm those it was intended to help, was a significant factor in the opposition he faced during his nomination. This perspective suggests that the author views affirmative action as a contentious issue and implies that Thomas's views on it may have been used against him politically, rather than any actual misconduct on his part. The author seems to sympathize with Thomas, viewing the renewed public scrutiny as an unjust ""second lynching"" that he must endure."	0.025689999999999998	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt	1
	None	The author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action in the provided summary. The focus of the text is on the political ramifications of Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination and the state of civil discourse in American politics. While it is noted that Bork himself had a critical view of affirmative action rulings by the court, the author's personal stance on the matter is not discussed. Therefore, based on the summary provided, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text recounts the rejection of Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination by the Senate on October 23, 1987. Bork was a highly qualified legal intellectual known for his originalist views, judicial restraint, and criticism of decisions like Roe v. Wade. The author argues that Bork's views were not extreme and that he was unfairly characterized as such by Democrats. They suggest that the battle over Bork's nomination marked the beginning of the end for civil discourse in American politics, with both parties becoming increasingly obstructionist and unwilling to cooperate. The author implies that the tactics used against Bork were unfair and driven by a fear of his potential impact on the court's balance. They also note that current nominees often hide their judicial philosophies to avoid similar attacks.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions that Robert Bork found the court's recent rulings on affirmative action to be problematic, indicating a critical view of affirmative action policies as they were interpreted by the judiciary at the time. However, the author does not explicitly provide their own perspective on affirmative action within the text. Rather, the focus is on the broader political and judicial implications of Bork's nomination and the tactics used to oppose it. The author's main argument centers on the negative impact that the Bork nomination battle had on political discourse and the precedent it set for future judicial confirmations, rather than on the specific legal issues such as affirmative action."	0.02695	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but they provide a descriptive account of Jesse Helms's opposition to affirmative action, noting it was based on principle. The author neither endorses nor criticizes Helms's stance but instead provides context by mentioning Helms's controversial stance on race and his later changes in views on other issues. This suggests that the author may be providing a balanced historical account rather than taking a personal stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
Jesse Helms, who passed away at the age of 86, was a prominent figure in modern conservatism, often seen as more defiant than the optimistic Ronald Reagan. While Reagan's legacy has been reassessed positively, Helms remains a target of liberal disdain. However, liberal groups have adopted some of his campaign tactics. Helms, a former television commentator, switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party and won a U.S. Senate seat in 1972, going on to serve five terms. He was known for his staunch social conservatism, anti-communism, opposition to union power, and a proactive foreign policy. Helms helped Ronald Reagan's political career by securing his victory in the North Carolina primary. Although often outvoted in the Senate, Helms was influential in blocking appointments and highlighting issues like U.N. corruption. His legacy is marred by his support for authoritarian regimes and opposition to the Martin Luther King holiday. Helms's stance on race is controversial, but he did hire a diverse staff and opposed affirmative action and forced busing on principle. He also changed his views later in life, supporting Israel and AIDS funding in Africa after initial opposition. Helms's strategies have influenced both conservatives and liberals in political campaigning and policy-making.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author of the text, Mr. Fund, appears to view Jesse Helms's criticisms of affirmative action as justified. Fund suggests that Helms's opposition was based on principle and a belief in government overreach. However, the author also points out that Helms failed to couple his criticisms with a broader call for social and moral transformation in the South and a clear condemnation of racist practices. This indicates that while the author acknowledges Helms's stance on affirmative action as part of his conservative principles, he also recognizes the shortcomings in Helms's approach to addressing the complexities of race relations and civil rights."	0.03257	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt	1
	None	The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, does not directly express his personal perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. His discussion focuses on the role of interest groups in influencing political agendas, using affirmative action as an example of an issue affected by such groups. There is no indication of Birnbaum's personal stance on affirmative action, as his commentary centers on the dynamics of interest group influence rather than his views on the policies themselves.	"Summary:
Jeffrey Birnbaum's article discusses the significant influence of interest groups on the political agenda in Washington, D.C. He argues that contrary to the popular belief that political leaders set the agenda, it is often interest groups that push issues to the forefront through sustained campaigns and strategic lobbying. Birnbaum cites Douglas Holtz-Eakin's assessment that Medicare and Medicaid pose larger financial challenges than Social Security, yet Social Security has become a focal point in Washington due to the efforts of organizations like AARP and free-market think tanks. He explains how groups like the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) have effectively mobilized their members to influence legislation, such as the repeal of the inheritance tax. The article also touches on the role of these groups in other high-profile issues, like the Terri Schiavo case and the debate over judicial nominations. Birnbaum suggests that while organized interests can significantly impact policy, not all critical issues receive the same level of attention or support from powerful interest groups, leaving some concerns and populations underrepresented.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, does not directly express his personal perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. Instead, he uses affirmative action as an example of a divisive issue that becomes prominent due to the efforts of interest groups. He mentions that the brewing battle in the Senate over judicial nominees is partly a stand-in for other contentious issues, including affirmative action. This indicates that affirmative action, like other issues, is subject to the influence of organized interest groups that either support or oppose it. Birnbaum's focus is on the mechanics of how interest groups shape the political agenda rather than on his stance on any particular issue."	0.04011	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt	1
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to call for a nuanced and open discussion about the topic, recognizing the complexities and the need for dialogue. Although the author criticizes Graglia's approach and suggests that his views could be seen as problematic, they do not outright condemn or endorse affirmative action. Instead, they emphasize the importance of considering various factors that contribute to minority achievement and the need for education through dialogue. This stance suggests a desire for a balanced discussion rather than a firm position for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding comments made by Lino Graglia, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who argued that Black and Mexican-American students are not as academically competitive as white students in selective institutions due to a culture that does not encourage achievement. His remarks sparked outrage among politicians, students, and faculty, with some calling for his dismissal and others defending his right to free speech while disagreeing with his views. The author of the text suggests that while Graglia's concerns about minority underachievement have some basis, his views are problematic because they imply that minority underachievement is inevitable. The text also criticizes President Clinton for not being open to a nuanced dialogue on race and suggests that America needs education through dialogue, despite the potential for hurt feelings.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, is that it is a contentious issue that deserves a nuanced and open dialogue. The author believes that Graglia has a right to oppose affirmative action but criticizes him for his approach, which could be interpreted as suggesting that minorities are inherently underachievers. The text implies that factors such as socioeconomic circumstances, the convergence of race and poverty, and historical discrimination should be considered when discussing minority achievement and affirmative action. The author seems to advocate for a discussion that includes a variety of viewpoints and acknowledges the complexities surrounding affirmative action, rather than outright condemnation or endorsement of any particular stance."	0.025690000000000004	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	1

2	neutral	The author's stance on affirmative action cannot be conclusively determined from the provided text. While Clarence Page does not explicitly discuss affirmative action, he defends the concept of diversity against Jonah Goldberg's criticism, suggesting he may see value in diversity as a strength, which is a principle underlying affirmative action. However, without a direct statement from Page on affirmative action, any categorization would be based on inference rather than explicit evidence.	"Summary:
Clarence Page critiques Jonah Goldberg's book ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" which targets political cliches commonly used by liberals. Page acknowledges that some cliches are tired and need reevaluation, but he also appreciates the succinct truths they can convey. He challenges Goldberg's dismissal of phrases such as ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer,"" by pointing out the real-life consequences of wrongful convictions, as highlighted by the Innocence Project. Page also disagrees with Goldberg's take on diversity and the phrase ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,"" arguing that these concepts have more complexity than Goldberg allows. Additionally, Page lists several cliches he finds annoying from the political right, suggesting that the use of cliches is not solely a liberal practice.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author, Clarence Page, does not directly address his stance on affirmative action in the provided text, he does counter Jonah Goldberg's criticism of the cliche ""Diversity is strength."" Page suggests that America's diverse ethnic composition, including people of different backgrounds working together with common purpose, has contributed to the country's prosperity. This implies that Page sees value in diversity, which is a fundamental principle of affirmative action. However, without a direct statement from Page on affirmative action, we can only infer his perspective based on his defense of diversity and his critique of Goldberg's position."	0.02555	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as evidenced by the criticism of its implementation in elite universities and the argument that it focuses too much on ethnic quotas rather than genuine diversity. The text presents affirmative action as flawed, particularly when it benefits individuals with distant or questionable minority status. The author advocates for a reevaluation of affirmative action policies, suggesting that they may not be serving their intended purpose and could become outdated. The stance is not strongly against, as the author does not call for the complete abolition of affirmative action but rather a reform to better serve its intended goals.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority, specifically Native American, during her academic career. Warren cited family stories of Native American ancestry, particularly from her grandfather's physical features, as part of her identity. However, there is no firm evidence of her Cherokee heritage. The author reflects on a similar personal family narrative regarding Native American ancestry, only to find no evidence in their great-grandfather's autobiography. Warren's claim became an issue when it was used to showcase Harvard Law School's commitment to diversity. The author criticizes the academic culture that emphasizes distant ethnic connections to fulfill diversity quotas rather than fostering genuine diversity of experiences and perspectives. The author suggests that Warren's working-class background would have been a more authentic contribution to diversity at Harvard, rather than the unsubstantiated claim of Native American heritage.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author criticizes the practice of affirmative action in elite universities, particularly the tendency to focus on ethnic quotas rather than true diversity. The author views the situation with Elizabeth Warren as an extreme example of how affirmative action can go wrong, resulting in benefits for individuals with very distant or questionable minority status while not necessarily helping those the programs are meant to support, such as descendants of slaves. The author argues that affirmative action should aim to create academic communities with a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, rather than just a superficial range of ethnic backgrounds. The author also suggests that affirmative action has sometimes prioritized certain minority groups, like West Indian immigrants, over others, like African Americans with a longer history of disadvantage in the United States. The text calls for a reevaluation of these practices in light of a changing America where mixed heritage will become more common, implying that current affirmative action policies may become outdated and ineffective."	0.02993	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	2
	None	The author, Drew Westen, does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. Instead, he discusses how affirmative action has been used as a political tool by Ronald Reagan to appeal to certain demographics and to exploit racial themes. While the author mentions the negative impact of politicizing affirmative action on the white working-class male demographic and acknowledges the discomfort caused by rapid social changes, including affirmative action, there is no explicit endorsement or condemnation of the policy itself from the author. Therefore, based on the summary provided, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined as the focus is more on the political manipulation of the issue rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of having a clear vision in American presidential politics, using historical examples to illustrate its significance. Franklin D. Roosevelt is praised for presenting a vision that helped America recover from the Great Depression, while Bill Clinton is noted for echoing the same sentiment about the necessity of vision. The author criticizes both Mitt Romney and President Obama for not providing a compelling vision to the American people during a time of economic difficulty. The text also critiques the Republican narrative of small government and fiscal responsibility, pointing out the hypocrisy in their failure to practice what they preach, as seen in the increased national debt under Reagan and George W. Bush. The author, Drew Westen, suggests that the lack of vision from candidates is partly due to their cautious nature and the influence of money in politics, which has made bold measures like those taken by Roosevelt nearly impossible today. Westen also traces the historical shift in ideology with Reagan's presidency, which introduced themes that resonated with voters but ultimately led to increased inequality and the Great Recession of 2008. He concludes by highlighting George H.W. Bush's dismissive attitude towards the importance of vision, which resulted in him being a one-term president.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Drew Westen, provides a critical perspective on affirmative action by discussing its impact on the white working-class male demographic during Ronald Reagan's presidency. Westen suggests that Reagan's appeal to voters included exploiting racial themes and capitalizing on the fears and anger of those who felt threatened by affirmative action and the women's movement. He indicates that Reagan's narrative resonated with many Americans who were uncomfortable with the rapid social changes of the 1960s, including affirmative action. By mentioning this, Westen implies that affirmative action was a contentious issue that was politicized by Reagan to gain support, particularly in the South, as part of a broader strategy to challenge the power and scope of government. The author's perspective seems to be that affirmative action was used as a political tool to mobilize certain voter bases while also contributing to the ideological divide and the challenges in creating a unifying vision for the country."	0.03608	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	2
	None	The text provided does not offer any direct commentary on the author's stance towards affirmative action. The focus of the article is on judicial integrity and the potential politicization of Supreme Court decisions, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the author's perspective on affirmative action based on the information given.	"Summary:
The article discusses the reaction to Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, where the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act was upheld as a tax. Many commentators have suggested that Roberts's decision was motivated by a desire to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of the Supreme Court, especially given the polarized political climate. Critics, including the author, question whether Roberts's decision was influenced by concerns over the Court's reputation rather than legal principles. The clarity of the dissenting opinion, which was originally the majority view with Roberts's support, contrasts with the perceived contrivance of his opinion. The article suggests that liberal justices are not held to the same standard of integrity when their decisions align with Democratic Party outcomes. The author references Justice Scalia's dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to argue that justices should focus on legal correctness rather than public perception. The article concludes by questioning whether Roberts's decision was a strategic move to gain political capital for future cases, which would cast doubt on the Court's integrity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text provided does not directly discuss the author's views on affirmative action, it does reference it in the context of future Supreme Court cases that Chief Justice Roberts might confront. The author seems to be more focused on the broader issue of judicial integrity and the potential politicization of Supreme Court decisions. The mention of affirmative action, along with other ""hot-button issues"" like gay marriage and the Voting Rights Act, suggests that these are areas where the Court's decisions could be particularly scrutinized for political bias or influence. The author's concern is that if decisions like the one in the health care case are seen as politically motivated, it could undermine the Court's integrity when ruling on other controversial issues, including affirmative action. However, without more explicit commentary from the author on affirmative action itself, it's difficult to ascertain their specific stance on the policy."	0.02947	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, John S. Rosenberg, is described as critical of affirmative action, particularly as it is supported by the Obama administration. He views the policy as a form of racial and ethnic discrimination that contradicts American values of equality and non-discrimination. He suggests that the policy is self-contradictory and undermines the principles it is meant to uphold. Given this criticism and the comparison to a paradoxical military strategy, it is clear that Rosenberg is not in favor of affirmative action as it is currently practiced.	"Summary:
The text is a letter to the editor expressing the author's view on the Obama administration's support for affirmative action in university admissions, as it urges the Supreme Court to permit the consideration of race as one factor in a holistic review process. The author argues that this approach, framed as promoting ""diversity,"" essentially discriminates among students based on race or ethnicity. The author criticizes this as a contradiction to the fundamental American principle of treating individuals without regard to race, creed, or color. The administration's argument, as interpreted by the author, is that diversity is essential to ensuring that careers crucial to the national interest are accessible to all segments of society, irrespective of race and ethnicity. The author concludes by likening the logic of affirmative action to the paradoxical military notion of destroying a village to save it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, John S. Rosenberg, is clearly critical of affirmative action as practiced by universities with the support of the Obama administration. He views the policy as a form of racial and ethnic discrimination that is at odds with core American values of equality and non-discrimination. Rosenberg suggests that the administration's reasoning is self-contradictory, as it promotes discrimination under the guise of achieving non-discriminatory goals. He implies that affirmative action is a flawed approach that undermines the principle it ostensibly seeks to uphold, which is the opening of opportunities to all individuals regardless of their race or ethnicity. His perspective is that affirmative action, as it is currently implemented, is not a legitimate or effective means of achieving true diversity or equality."	0.02055	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred through the discussion of Chief Justice John Roberts's questioning during the Fisher v. University of Texas case. The author's description of Roberts's skepticism and past conservative rulings on similar issues, as well as the references to observers who anticipate a conservative ruling against affirmative action, suggest that the author views affirmative action critically. The framing of the issue, with an emphasis on 'true equality' and the potential for affirmative action to be seen as discrimination, indicates that the author leans towards a somewhat against or strongly against stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which centers on the issue of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white applicant, claims she was denied admission due to her race, while the university defends its right to consider race to foster diversity. Chief Justice John Roberts, who had previously sided with liberals to uphold ObamaCare, showed skepticism during oral arguments about the university's use of race in admissions. He questioned the concept of ""critical mass"" for minority students and the potential for applicants to claim minority status. Observers like Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission suggest that Roberts's questions indicate he is likely to side against affirmative action in this case, consistent with his past conservative positions on similar issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a perspective that Chief Justice John Roberts is inclined toward a conservative view on affirmative action, as evidenced by his pointed questioning during the Fisher case oral arguments. The author references Roberts's past conservative rulings and suggests that despite his unexpected vote on ObamaCare, his stance on affirmative action remains unchanged. The tone indicates that Roberts is seen as a proponent of ""true equality"" and against discrimination, implying that he may view affirmative action as a form of discrimination. Todd Gaziano's comments further reinforce this interpretation, as he expresses hope in Roberts's conservative leanings based on his record and recent questioning. The author's framing of the issue suggests skepticism about the use of racial preferences in admissions and hints at an expectation that Roberts will vote against the university's affirmative action policy."	0.02239	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text acknowledges the historical importance and successes of the Voting Rights Act, which can be seen as analogous to affirmative action policies, but also highlights unintended consequences such as political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The author notes that the challenges to minority enfranchisement have changed since the original enactment of these measures and that minority voting rates have improved. This suggests a nuanced view that, while recognizing the past necessity and benefits of such policies, also points to potential drawbacks and the need for reassessment in the current context. The author does not express outright opposition to affirmative action but rather implies that its continued application should be critically evaluated.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the constitutionality and wisdom of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on it. The author acknowledges the VRA's success in securing voting rights for African Americans but points out its unintended consequences, such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The VRA has led to the creation of majority-minority districts, which tend to elect liberal African American Democrats, while other districts elect conservative white Republicans, squeezing out moderates. Although civil rights organizations defend the act, the author suggests that the current challenges to minority enfranchisement are different from those in 1965. The text also mentions that minority voters are not facing the same blunt denials of voting rights as before, citing a higher voting rate among blacks compared to whites in 2012. The author concludes that the Supreme Court might strike down or limit the pre-clearance provision of the VRA, which could prompt a debate on how to protect voting rights and restore the political center.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author draws parallels between affirmative action in universities and the creation of ""opportunity districts"" under the VRA. Both are seen as measures that have helped build a middle class and a cadre of black elected officials after segregation. However, the author seems to suggest that while these measures have had positive effects, they also come with limitations and unintended consequences, such as a potential cap on how high minority politicians can rise and a contribution to political polarization. The author's perspective indicates a belief that while affirmative action and similar policies have been historically important, it may be time to reassess their implementation in light of current realities and their broader impact on society and politics."	0.02933	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action. They focus on reporting the voting patterns and perspectives of the Supreme Court justices, particularly the female justices, in relation to various cases, including affirmative action. The author mentions Justice Ginsburg's solo dissent in an affirmative action case, indicating her support for the University of Texas's affirmative action policies, but the author does not offer a personal viewpoint or analysis on the matter. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court's term showcased an interesting trend in voting patterns, with the three female justices—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—voting together at least 93 percent of the time, making them the most cohesive and liberal bloc on the Court. Their alignment is attributed to ideology rather than gender. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, typically part of the liberal wing, diverged in key privacy cases, indicating a rightward shift. Meanwhile, the conservative justices showed more fragmented voting patterns compared to previous years. The three women justices were also prominent during Court arguments, with Ginsburg often asking the first question, Sotomayor asking the most questions, and Kagan being praised for the quality of her inquiries. Sotomayor gained additional attention due to her memoir and media appearances, becoming an inspiration to many. However, the female justices did not always vote together, notably dividing on same-sex marriage and affirmative action issues. Ginsburg dissented alone in an affirmative action case involving the University of Texas, while Kagan recused herself due to prior involvement as solicitor general. The article also touches on personal anecdotes, such as Justice Scalia's hunting trips with Kagan and his friendship with Ginsburg.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author reports that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor had differing views on affirmative action, with Ginsburg filing a solo dissent in a case that sent the University of Texas's affirmative action plan back to the lower courts for stricter scrutiny. This indicates that Ginsburg supported the affirmative action policies of the University of Texas, while the other justices, including Sotomayor, did not join her in dissent. The author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action but provides information on the justices' stances, suggesting that within the liberal wing of the Court, there is not a uniform approach to affirmative action."	0.03365	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action within the summary provided. The text discusses the reaction to Donald Sterling's racist remarks and the broader conversation about race in America, not affirmative action policies directly. The mention of a Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action is used to contrast with ongoing racial issues, which suggests that the author acknowledges the complexity of racial challenges in society. However, without a direct statement or clear indication of the author's views on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize their stance.	"Summary:
The text is a reaction to the NBA's lifetime ban of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after he made racist remarks. South Los Angeles barbershop owner Lawrence Tolliver expressed satisfaction with the NBA Commissioner's decision to ban Sterling for life, hoping it would force Sterling to sell the team. The incident arose when Sterling was recorded scolding a female friend for associating with black people and instructing her not to bring them to his games. This situation sparked a larger conversation about race in America at Tolliver's barbershop, where clients discussed historical and contemporary racial issues. They acknowledged progress on race but also recognized persistent challenges. The text also touches on the controversy over the NAACP's planned honor for Sterling and his history of discriminatory practices. Engineer and youth mentor Drew Palmer offered a dissenting view, questioning the selective outrage over Sterling's comments compared to other societal issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their perspective on affirmative action within the text provided. However, the author does mention a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests the country may be ready to move beyond affirmative action, which is juxtaposed with the racist remarks by Donald Sterling and Cliven Bundy. This contrast may imply that despite legal shifts away from affirmative action, racial issues and attitudes persist in society. The author's focus on the barbershop discussion about racial progress and the long road ahead hints at a recognition that while affirmative action policies may be under scrutiny or change, the underlying racial challenges they aim to address are still very much alive."	0.030180000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be supportive of affirmative action, particularly as implemented by the University of Texas at Austin. They recognize the complexity and the need for careful consideration in policies involving race but support the 5th Circuit's decision upholding the university's affirmative-action admissions policy. The author points out the insufficiency of the top 10 percent policy alone in achieving true diversity and highlights the need for more nuanced approaches. They also call for clearer guidance from the Supreme Court on affirmative action policies, indicating a belief in their importance and legitimacy. This perspective aligns with someone who sees affirmative action as a necessary and constructive tool for achieving diversity in educational institutions.	"Summary:
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit has reaffirmed the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policy, which is now pending a second review by the Supreme Court. The University of Texas fills most of its seats through a state policy that guarantees admission to students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, which indirectly promotes diversity. For the remaining seats, the university conducts a holistic review that considers race as one of many factors. Opponents argue that the top 10 percent policy already achieves sufficient diversity, but the university and the 5th Circuit maintain that the policy is a blunt instrument that doesn't account for the varying experiences of minority students from different backgrounds. The 5th Circuit's decision also highlights the lack of clear guidance from the Supreme Court on what constitutes constitutionally acceptable affirmative action, urging the Court to provide clearer definitions and to uphold the University of Texas's affirmative-action program.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective appears to be supportive of affirmative action, particularly in the context of the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policy. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the necessity for caution when the government makes distinctions based on race. However, they recognize the 5th Circuit's argument that the University of Texas's program is a prime example of a narrow, carefully designed affirmative-action policy that should pass judicial scrutiny.

The author also suggests that the top 10 percent policy, while helpful in promoting diversity, is insufficient on its own due to the ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. They argue for the necessity of a more nuanced approach to admissions that can capture the diverse experiences of minority applicants. Furthermore, the author believes that the Supreme Court should provide clearer guidelines on affirmative action to help public universities navigate these policies constitutionally and supports the idea that the University of Texas's program is a conscientious and permissible effort to achieve a diverse student body."	0.02826	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	2
	None	The text provided does not mention or discuss affirmative action in any capacity. It focuses on the issue of campus sexual assault proceedings, due process, and the role of universities and the government in these cases. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from this text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Paul Nungesser, a Columbia University student accused of rape by fellow student Emma Sulkowicz, who protested the university's handling of her case by carrying a mattress around campus. The Daily Beast published an interview with Nungesser and included Facebook messages that suggested a friendly relationship between him and Sulkowicz after the alleged incident, leading to questions about her story. This prompted a re-evaluation by the Columbia Daily Spectator and criticism from Sulkowicz's supporters. The author argues that the media has a reason to revisit the case, especially since Sulkowicz sought media attention after Columbia exonerated Nungesser.

The author also examines the broader issue of campus sexual assault proceedings, criticizing the Department of Education's (D.O.E.) pressure on universities to handle these cases internally with guidelines that many see as undermining due process. The author suggests that universities should push back against these guidelines, seek clarification on the definition of sexual misconduct, and adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" for determining guilt. The author proposes that universities should collaborate with local law enforcement to improve how sexual violence cases are handled, instead of creating their own problematic justice systems.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action; it focuses on the issue of campus sexual assault proceedings and the role of universities and the government in addressing these cases. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be discerned from the given text. The author's primary concern is with ensuring fairness and due process in the handling of sexual assault allegations on college campuses, as well as the appropriate role of universities in relation to the criminal justice system."	0.030600000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, William G. Bowen, is not directly discussing affirmative action as the main subject of his argument. His focus is on the topic of divestment campaigns in educational institutions. However, he mentions affirmative action in passing, noting that it deserves attention because of its direct impact on education. This suggests that Bowen sees affirmative action as a relevant issue for universities to engage with, in contrast to other social or political issues that may be less central to their mission. His stance on affirmative action itself is not explicitly stated, but he acknowledges its significance in the context of higher education. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that Bowen is at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as he recognizes its importance in relation to educational institutions.	"Summary:
William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, addresses the issue of divestment campaigns in colleges and universities, particularly those targeting fossil fuel company holdings. He acknowledges common practical objections to divestment, such as the complexity of investment portfolios, potential negative impacts on endowment funds, and skepticism about the efficacy of divestment in changing corporate practices. Bowen argues against the notion that universities have an obligation to take a stand on all issues of broad social importance, stating that this can distract from their educational mission. He believes affirmative action deserves attention due to its direct impact on education, unlike issues that are less central to academia, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Bowen also criticizes the moral hazards of divestment, including the hypocrisy of seeking institutional purity without personal sacrifice, the duty to honor donor intent, the risk of substituting easy institutional actions for more challenging personal civic responsibilities, and the potential to divert resources from pressing educational challenges such as improving outcomes for less-privileged students and addressing affordability. He warns against the slippery slope of using divestment as a political tool and stresses the need for educational institutions to focus on their core mission.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bowen views affirmative action as a legitimate concern for academic institutions because it directly impacts educational processes and outcomes. He suggests that universities have a stronger claim to engage with issues like affirmative action, which are central to their mission, rather than becoming embroiled in broader political issues that can detract from their primary educational responsibilities. Bowen's perspective implies that he sees affirmative action as integral to the functioning and integrity of educational institutions, as opposed to issues that do not bear directly on their educational role."	0.029290000000000004	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action but instead discusses the complexity of defining hate speech in the context of policy-making. The text uses affirmative action as an example to illustrate potential issues with crafting policies against intolerance, suggesting that advocacy for affirmative action might be misinterpreted under vague hate speech policies. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not the focus of the discussion, and there is not enough information to categorize their stance on the matter.	"Summary:
The University of California regents are struggling to create a hate-speech policy following recent anti-Semitic incidents. They decided not to adopt the proposed ""principles against intolerance"" during their September meeting and instead formed a committee to reevaluate the issue. The challenge lies in balancing the commitment to free speech with the prevention of hate speech without creating a policy that is unconstitutionally vague. Past attempts at other universities, like the University of Michigan, have been struck down by the Supreme Court. The text also discusses the difficulty in defining anti-Semitism and the right of free speech, including controversial opinions about Israel. Some campuses have adopted non-punitive speech guidelines, but these often leave people dissatisfied. The author suggests drafting a policy that reaffirms free expression while clearly defining what constitutes unprotected speech, such as threats or harassment.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their personal view on affirmative action but uses it as an example to illustrate the complexity of defining hate speech and the potential for policies to inadvertently stigmatize groups. The author raises the question of whether advocating affirmative action could be interpreted as stigmatizing racial minorities under a vague hate speech policy. This example is used to highlight the difficulty in crafting a policy that does not impede on protected speech while trying to prevent hate speech. It suggests a concern that affirmative action advocacy, which is intended to address inequalities, could be misconstrued as hate speech under poorly defined policies. The author's focus is on the importance of clear definitions in policy-making rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.02669	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text. Affirmative action is mentioned as an example of a moral issue that contributes to the polarization of politics, but the author does not provide a clear stance for or against it. Instead, the focus is on how engagement with such issues is driven by emotional satisfaction and moral self-righteousness, which complicates political compromise. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be accurately categorized based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the concept of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where political engagement is driven by the emotional satisfaction it provides to individuals, rather than solely by policy or ideological outcomes. The author uses the rise of Donald Trump as a case study to illustrate how his defiance of conventional norms and controversial statements have paradoxically increased his popularity among Republicans. The author argues that politics has shifted from mainly economic concerns to issues framed in moral terms, such as abortion, affirmative action, and immigration, which are more divisive and less conducive to compromise. Supporters of moral causes on both the right and left derive ""psychic benefits"" from feeling morally superior, and Trump's assertiveness offers these benefits to his followers. The author also discusses the dilemma faced by the political establishment and mainstream media when responding to Trump's proposals, as criticism seems to only bolster his support. The author suggests that this dynamic makes political compromise more difficult and is a reflection of a broader trend in politics towards self-righteousness.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not delve deeply into the specifics of affirmative action, it is mentioned as one of the moral issues that has become a flashpoint in contemporary politics. The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as part of a broader critique of how moral issues have become highly polarized, with individuals on both sides feeling a sense of moral superiority that is gratifying to their self-esteem. The author implies that this moral framing leads to rigid positions that make it difficult to reach political compromises. Thus, while the author does not explicitly state a position for or against affirmative action, they suggest that the way such issues are politically contested can contribute to a less functional system of governance due to the emotional and moral stakes involved for the participants."	0.028290000000000003	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The summary discusses various events and issues, including the Supreme Court's new term dealing with cases on affirmative action, but does not provide any analysis or opinion from the author regarding the topic. Therefore, we cannot determine the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information given.	"Summary:
The provided text touches on various significant events and issues from 2014 onwards. Chief Justice Roberts announced that Supreme Court documents would be available online by 2016. The Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, which resulted in the death of 12 people, raised questions about the limits of free speech and satire. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained silent on the Republican healthcare plan should the Supreme Court rule against Obamacare. The mass shooting at a historic black church in Charleston and subsequent gun attacks highlighted the ongoing debate on gun control. Concerns were raised about Donald Trump's influence on the Republican Party and female voters, and his proposal for a Muslim immigration ban post the San Bernardino attacks. The Islamic State's atrocities against Yazidi women were reported, and the UN faced criticism for appointing a Saudi official to a human rights panel. Speaker John Boehner resigned, and tensions between the U.S. and Russia regarding Syria's leadership were evident. The Supreme Court's new term included cases on abortion, religious rights, and affirmative action, with Justice Anthony Kennedy playing a pivotal role. The text also notes the inconsistent media labeling of attackers in the U.S. as either gunmen or terrorists.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the mention of the Supreme Court's new term dealing with affirmative action cases suggests that it is a contentious issue that is being addressed at the highest level of the judicial system. Justice Anthony Kennedy's central role indicates that his views could significantly influence the Court's decisions on these cases. The inclusion of affirmative action in the summary implies its importance as a legal and social topic during the Court's term, but without further context or analysis, the author's specific viewpoint on the matter cannot be determined."	0.02323	affirmative action	txt/1752156404.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, is depicted as advocating for affirmative action, specifically for low-income students, to correct imbalances in the college admissions system that favor wealthy students. He supports the notion that affirmative action can help mitigate the disadvantages that low-income students face and that it can also contribute to maintaining ethnic diversity in colleges. Levy's perspective is characterized by his criticism of the current system's biases and his argument for a 'poverty preference' to promote fairness and recognize merit that includes overcoming significant obstacles.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of New York City schools, highlights the stark disparities in college admissions favoring the wealthy. He presents data showing that only 3% of students at selective colleges come from the bottom 25% income bracket, while 72% come from the wealthiest quartile. Despite facing disadvantages, once admitted, low-income students perform as well as their affluent peers. Levy criticizes the current system that gives preferences to legacies and athletes in sports typically associated with affluence. He also points out the obstacles low-income students face, such as lack of access to test preparation, early admission constraints, and inadequate college counseling. Levy advocates for affirmative action for low-income students to level the playing field and maintain ethnic diversity in colleges.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy supports affirmative action for low-income students as a way to correct the imbalances in college admissions that favor wealthy students. He argues that the current system is biased against smart, poor children and that a ""poverty preference"" in admissions would help to mitigate the disadvantages these students face. Levy believes that such measures would not only promote fairness but also indirectly maintain ethnic diversity in higher education institutions, especially if race-conscious affirmative action is eliminated by the Supreme Court. He emphasizes that merit should be the basis for college admissions, and that overcoming significant obstacles should be recognized and rewarded in the admissions process."	0.026090000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors recognize the value of affirmative action in promoting diversity but suggest extending its principles to address ideological diversity, specifically the underrepresentation of conservative perspectives in academia. They do not advocate for direct hiring preferences based on political beliefs but rather for efforts to include more conservative viewpoints through invitations to speakers and creation of specialized positions. Their perspective is not categorical support or opposition to affirmative action; instead, they propose a nuanced application of its principles to enhance ideological diversity.	"Summary:
The authors, conservative professors Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr., acknowledge that while they have defended universities against conservative criticism, they also recognize that academia is not free from political bias. They point out that conservatives are significantly underrepresented in the social sciences and suggest that this may be due to a combination of self-selection by conservative students and a hostile climate towards conservative ideas within these fields. They highlight studies showing conservative students feel intimidated and dissatisfied in social science courses, leading many to avoid these areas of study. The authors argue that this lack of political diversity is problematic for universities, which should model civil discourse and seek a wide range of perspectives to arrive at truth. They suggest that affirmative action, traditionally used to promote diversity and remedy historical discrimination, could be extended to increase political pluralism in academia. While they do not advocate for hiring preferences, they propose that universities should invite more conservative speakers, consider hiring faculty with interests that may attract conservatives, and create visiting appointments for scholars of conservative thought to enhance ideological diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors view affirmative action as a tool that has been used to promote diversity within universities, primarily for groups that have faced historical discrimination. They note that the rationale for affirmative action has shifted over time from remedial justice to the promotion of diversity for its own sake. The authors suggest that if the goal of affirmative action is to bring a variety of perspectives to the university setting, then it should also be used to increase the representation of conservative ideas, which are currently underrepresented in the social sciences. They believe that by doing so, universities can better fulfill their role as models of civil discourse and as institutions that seek to approximate truth through a multitude of perspectives. The authors are not in favor of preferences in admissions and hiring based purely on political beliefs but advocate for more inclusion of conservative viewpoints through other means, such as speaker invitations and specialized faculty positions."	0.032	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author presents affirmative action in a positive light, emphasizing the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of its constitutionality and the importance of diversity in educational environments. They are critical of the opposition to affirmative action, as seen in their critique of Justices Thomas and Alito's views, and they commend Justice Kennedy for his majority opinion upholding the practice. The author clearly sees affirmative action as beneficial for society and necessary for creating an inclusive educational environment that reflects America's demographics. This perspective indicates a strong support for affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court has consistently allowed public universities to consider race in admissions, with certain limitations. In a 4 to 3 decision, the Court upheld the University of Texas at Austin's admissions process, which uses race as one of several factors for a portion of its applicants. The case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who was denied admission and claimed discrimination against white applicants. The University of Texas employs a ""Top 10 Percent"" rule for three-quarters of its admissions and a ""holistic"" review for the remainder, which includes race among other factors. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, emphasizing the deference due to universities in defining educational goals like diversity, while also requiring that these goals be measurable for judicial review. Justice Kagan recused herself, and Justice Scalia had passed away. The case was previously sent back to a lower court in 2013 for closer examination of the university's rationale for considering race, which was subsequently provided.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text supports affirmative action and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policies. The author believes that the decision is a strong reaffirmation of the constitutionality of considering race in college admissions and that it will define future judgments on this issue. They highlight the importance of diversity in educational environments and the benefits it brings to society.

The author is critical of the opposition to affirmative action, particularly the views of Justices Thomas and Alito, who reject the consideration of race in admissions. Justice Thomas is quoted as dismissing the benefits of a diverse learning environment, and Justice Alito is noted for his lengthy dissent arguing against the university's rationale for its policies.

Justice Ginsburg's perspective is also mentioned, pointing out that even the ""Top 10 Percent"" plan is inherently race-conscious due to the segregation in Texas high schools. The author appreciates Justice Kennedy's skepticism of the claim that America is already colorblind or that ending race-conscious policies would lead to a colorblind society. They commend Kennedy for rejecting such views and ensuring that universities can continue to foster diversity that reflects America's demographics. The author's perspective is clearly in favor of affirmative action as a means to achieve a diverse and inclusive educational environment."	0.03198	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	Marilynne Rudick criticizes the use of affirmative action in the context of Maryland's medical marijuana licensing process, suggesting that it detracts from the primary goal of providing medical marijuana to patients in need. Her frustration stems from the delays caused by the focus on geographic diversity, which she sees as a misplaced priority. Rudick's argument indicates that she believes the medical needs should take precedence over affirmative action policies in this instance.	"Summary:
The text is a letter expressing frustration over the ongoing controversy regarding geographic diversity in Maryland's medical marijuana licensing process. The author, Marilynne Rudick, who has multiple sclerosis and could benefit from medical marijuana, is disheartened by the more than two-year delay since the state legalized medical marijuana. Rudick criticizes Maryland politicians for losing sight of the law's purpose, arguing that medical marijuana should be seen as a medical program rather than an economic development initiative or an affirmative action program. She urges politicians and regulators to expedite the availability of medical marijuana to those in need.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Marilynne Rudick, seems to have a critical view of affirmative action in the context of the medical marijuana licensing process. She suggests that affirmative action is not the appropriate lens through which to view the distribution of medical marijuana growth licenses. Rudick's primary concern is the accessibility of medical marijuana for patients who require it for their health conditions, and she believes that the focus on affirmative action is a distraction from this goal. Her perspective indicates that she sees affirmative action as secondary to the medical needs of the population and that the state's focus should be on the expeditious provision of medical marijuana to patients rather than on the equitable distribution of growth licenses among diverse geographic areas."	0.016509999999999997	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action, focusing instead on the implications of Judge Neil Gorsuch's potential confirmation to the Supreme Court. The author is concerned about how Gorsuch's originalist interpretation of the Constitution might impact progressive causes, which may include affirmative action. However, since the author's primary focus is on the importance of understanding Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and its potential effects on a range of issues, rather than on affirmative action specifically, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action itself. The text does not provide sufficient information to determine the author's personal views on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia. It suggests that rather than focusing on partisan tactics, senators should engage Gorsuch in serious discussions about his constitutional views, the role of precedent, and how the court should adapt principles to changing times. Democrats are urged to question Gorsuch about his past rulings and his approach to the role of a Supreme Court justice, including his originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The text also touches on the potential impact of Gorsuch's confirmation on progressive causes and the importance of understanding his judicial philosophy, which could shape the court for decades.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their perspective on affirmative action but raises concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, which includes affirmative action. The author implies that there is a need to understand Gorsuch's views on constitutional interpretation and how it might impact rulings related to affirmative action and other issues. By questioning whether Gorsuch might interpret the Constitution strictly as it was understood by the framers, the author suggests that such an approach could limit the court's ability to address modern issues like affirmative action that were not anticipated by the Constitution's authors. The perspective seems to be that the Senate should thoroughly explore Gorsuch's judicial philosophy to assess how it could influence future decisions on affirmative action and other rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution."	0.029949999999999997	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's discussion of affirmative action is limited to its mention as part of a historical reference about ballot initiatives and does not directly express any personal views on the policy itself. The author's primary concern is the potential for partisan bias in the crafting of ballot initiative language by attorneys general. Since the author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated and is only mentioned in passing as part of a larger argument about ballot initiative language, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of language in ballot initiatives, focusing on a controversy in California where Republicans sued Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, for allegedly crafting a biased title for their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees. The title, which omits direct terms like ""taxes"" and ""fees,"" is seen as potentially misleading and possibly crafted to diminish support for the measure. The issue highlights a broader problem where attorneys general, who are responsible for writing ""true and impartial"" ballot titles and summaries, have been accused of partisan bias in the past. The text suggests that assigning the task of writing ballot titles and summaries to a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), could be a solution, although a recent proposal to do so was unsuccessful.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author refers to affirmative action in the context of historical ballot initiatives and the role of the attorney general in crafting language for ballot measures. Specifically, the author mentions that former Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for not including the term ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209 in 1996, which sought to end state affirmative action programs. This example is used to illustrate the broader point that the wording of ballot initiative titles and summaries can be contentious and may be influenced by the political leanings of the attorney general responsible for writing them. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not directly stated; the focus is on the potential for partisan bias in the language used to describe ballot initiatives related to such policies."	0.026439999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Bari A. Williams, appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. She expresses concern over the tech industry's shift toward prioritizing cognitive diversity, which she fears may come at the expense of racial and gender diversity. Williams argues for a balanced approach that includes both cognitive and identity diversity, highlighting the importance of continued efforts to recruit and hire from underrepresented groups. Her advocacy for maintaining a focus on racial and gender diversity suggests that she supports the principles of affirmative action, although she does not explicitly state her position on policy.	"Summary:
Denise Young Smith, Apple's VP of Diversity and Inclusion, sparked controversy with her comment suggesting that a group of white men can be diverse if they bring different life experiences to the table. After backlash, she clarified her stance, emphasizing that diversity includes women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and other underrepresented minorities. The author, Bari A. Williams, expresses concern that the tech industry's focus on ""cognitive diversity"" is overshadowing the need to increase racial and gender diversity. Williams cites statistics showing low representation of black, Latino, and female employees in tech leadership. She argues that redefining diversity to prioritize cognitive diversity could lead to neglecting the recruitment and hiring of underrepresented groups. Williams advocates for a balanced approach that values both cognitive and identity diversity, emphasizing that tech companies should not abandon their efforts to increase racial and gender diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to be critical of the way affirmative action is being reinterpreted in the tech industry. Williams suggests that the shift towards valuing cognitive diversity, which may have roots in the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, could lead to a dilution of efforts to address racial and gender disparities. She underscores the importance of not forgetting the more traditional aspects of diversity, such as cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability, gender, and racial differences. Williams implies that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the need for identity diversity, which involves actively recruiting and hiring from underrepresented groups that have historically faced barriers in the tech industry. She stresses that these groups add tangible value to companies and deserve equal opportunities in the tech sector."	0.03939	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The text does not explicitly mention the author's stance on affirmative action. However, based on the discussion of systemic racism and the need for acknowledgment and confrontation of this issue, it can be inferred that the author might view affirmative action as a positive measure to combat racial inequality. The author's emphasis on the denial of racism as a barrier to progress suggests a perspective that might support proactive steps like affirmative action to address and correct racial disparities. Despite this inference, the lack of direct commentary on affirmative action means that we cannot conclusively categorize the author's stance without further information.	"Summary:
The text discusses the pervasive issue of racism in America and the common practice of denial as a defense mechanism to avoid confronting this reality. It highlights that denial is not limited to any one political party or ideology but is a widespread problem across the nation. The author points to historical examples of racism among American presidents, including those who owned slaves and those who expressed racist sentiments, to argue that President Trump's racism is not an anomaly but part of a long-standing pattern. The text also criticizes the use of coded language that allows individuals to deny their racism while perpetuating racist policies and attitudes. It emphasizes that being labeled a ""racist"" has become stigmatized to the point where it's seen as an identity rather than a description of actions or beliefs. The author advocates for a shift towards confession and acknowledgment of racism as opposed to denial.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not directly discuss affirmative action in detail, the author's perspective on racism suggests that he would likely view affirmative action as a necessary response to systemic racism and inequality. The mention of resistance to affirmative action policies as part of the denial of racism indicates that the author may see such policies as attempts to address and correct racial disparities. The author's focus on confronting and acknowledging racism, rather than denying it, aligns with the principles behind affirmative action, which aim to provide opportunities to historically marginalized groups. However, without explicit statements from the author on this topic, this interpretation remains an educated inference based on the overall arguments presented in the text."	0.033740000000000006	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not directly state their personal stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. Instead, they express a concern about the cultural and political tactics used to debate and potentially silence dissent on various issues, including affirmative action. The author's focus is on the broader implications of cultural shifts and the potential backlash from marginalizing certain viewpoints. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The author reflects on their initial belief that while there is strong public support for moderate gun restrictions, legislative efforts to implement them have repeatedly failed. They note that since the Sandy Hook shooting, most state-level gun laws have actually loosened restrictions, and nearly all gun-related bills in Congress have failed, except for one that also loosened gun use. The author suggests that to pass gun restrictions, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue and show respect to gun owners, similar to the bipartisan approach to the opioid crisis. However, the author observes that the push for gun restrictions has instead become highly polarized, particularly in the wake of the Parkland shooting, with left-wing groups involved and extreme rhetoric being used.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
While the text does not focus on affirmative action, the author mentions it in the context of discussing the broader cultural shift in what opinions are considered acceptable in society. They express concern that progressive efforts to silence dissent are marginalizing certain viewpoints, including opposition to affirmative action, to the extent that expressing such opinions could end one's career. The author warns that this kind of cultural silencing can lead to backlash and suggests that while progressives may be winning the culture war on many fronts, including affirmative action, the tactics used to achieve these victories could breed illiberalism and result in political consequences."	0.02609	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, Richard Cohen, appears to be strongly against affirmative action, particularly in the context of admissions to elite public schools like Stuyvesant High School. He argues that the current merit-based system, which relies on an entrance exam, is fair and should not be altered to reflect demographic representation. Cohen is critical of the idea of changing this system in a way that would disadvantage Asian American students from poor families who have earned their admission through hard work and preparation. His emphasis on maintaining a system that rewards merit and effort without regard to race or ethnicity indicates a strong opposition to affirmative action policies that would alter the current admissions process.	"Summary:
Richard Cohen expresses his astonishment that President Trump, despite being in New York occasionally, has not visited Stuyvesant High School, an elite public school with a majority Asian American student body. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio considers the racial composition of the school, which does not reflect the city's demographics, a ""monumental injustice"" and seeks to reform the admissions process to increase the number of Hispanic and black students. Cohen connects this to the sentiment among Trump's base that liberal policies have favored certain groups at their expense. He describes the admissions process as purely merit-based, relying solely on an entrance exam. Cohen highlights that many of the Asian American students at these elite schools come from poor families who sacrifice to prepare their children for the admissions test. He opposes affirmative action in this context, arguing that it is unfair to deprive these students of their earned opportunities. The mayor has already made some changes to the admissions process and aims to eliminate the test entirely, a move Cohen believes would undermine a system that has facilitated social mobility and fulfilled the American dream.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Cohen's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially in the context of New York City's elite public schools. He believes that the current merit-based system, which solely relies on an entrance exam, is the fairest method of admission. Cohen argues that affirmative action should not come at the expense of Asian American students, many of whom are from poor families that have worked hard and played by the rules to succeed. He views the mayor's proposal to change the admissions process as a destruction of a system that has allowed countless poor students to ascend into the middle class and beyond. Cohen's tolerance for affirmative action is limited and does not extend to situations where he feels it penalizes those who have earned their place through merit. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining a system that rewards hard work and effort, rather than one that allocates opportunities based on race or ethnicity."	0.03146	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	2
	None	The author, David Leonhardt, appears to take a pragmatic approach to the issue of affirmative action rather than expressing a moral or ideological stance on its merits. His discussion is centered on political strategy and the effectiveness of affirmative action as a campaign issue, rather than its value as a policy. He suggests Democrats should not prioritize affirmative action during the confirmation battle or midterm campaign because it does not hold a decisive advantage in public opinion. His focus is on winning elections and addressing progressive concerns through democratic means rather than court rulings. Therefore, his perspective is not directly concerned with the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself, but rather with its role in political strategy.	"Summary:
David Leonhardt provides a strategic guide for Democrats in response to President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, which is likely to push the court further to the right. He outlines three steps: being realistic about the low chances of preventing the confirmation, not losing hope by building a movement and focusing on local and state elections, and knowing their strengths by focusing on issues with broad public support during the midterm campaign rather than divisive social issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Democrats should not prioritize affirmative action as a key issue during the confirmation battle or the midterm campaign. He implies that while affirmative action is an important issue that inspires liberal passion, it may not be strategically wise to focus on it because it does not hold a decisive advantage in public opinion. Leonhardt advises Democrats to concentrate on issues where they have stronger public support, such as health insurance, taxation, corporate power, and the Trump administration's corruption. He stresses the importance of winning elections to address progressive concerns democratically rather than relying on court rulings."	0.024690000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's initial commendation of Pete Wilson's support for affirmative-action hiring practices indicates a positive view towards affirmative action. However, the later criticism of Wilson's efforts to eliminate affirmative action, and the view that this reversal was detrimental to the progress of minorities, suggests that the author believes affirmative action is beneficial and necessary. The author's use of sarcasm ('gracias') and the portrayal of Wilson's reversal as a betrayal imply a stance that is critical of actions against affirmative action. The overall tone suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action and disapproves of Wilson's attempt to dismantle it.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the political career of former California Governor Pete Wilson, who served in various public roles for over 30 years. The author offers a sarcastic ""gracias"" (thank you) for Wilson's contributions, highlighting both positive and negative aspects of his career. While initially commending Wilson's moderate politics, environmental protection, and support for affirmative-action hiring practices, the author criticizes him for later actions that included deregulating California's electricity market, instituting three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted illegal immigrants.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a complex view of Pete Wilson's stance on affirmative action. Initially, the author appreciates Wilson's early career efforts to implement affirmative-action hiring practices, suggesting that Wilson once recognized and sought to address the disadvantages faced by minorities. However, the author criticizes Wilson's later efforts to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California and beyond, interpreting it as a complete reversal of his previous position. This turn is viewed as having radicalized college students and undermined the progress that affirmative action had made in helping minorities ascend into the middle class. The author's perspective is that Wilson's change in stance on affirmative action was detrimental and a betrayal of his earlier, more progressive efforts to support minority communities."	0.02751	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt	2
	None	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not provide a clear personal stance on affirmative action in the text summary provided. He discusses affirmative action in the context of how Supreme Court justices must interpret the Constitution and make value judgments, suggesting that such decisions are influenced by the justices' ideologies and life experiences. The author's focus is more on the role of justices in interpreting the Constitution rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize his stance on affirmative action based on this summary.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, a distinguished professor of law, criticizes the analogy used by Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh, that likens justices to ""umpires."" He argues that unlike umpires who apply rules with limited interpretation, Supreme Court justices create rules and have significant discretion in interpreting the law. Chemerinsky asserts that a justice's decisions are influenced by their ideologies and life experiences, as historical Supreme Court decisions have shown. He gives examples such as the interpretation of the 1st Amendment in relation to campaign spending, the 2nd Amendment on gun rights, and the 4th Amendment on what constitutes reasonable searches. The author also discusses how the Constitution's open-ended language requires justices to make value choices, especially in cases involving affirmative action and same-sex marriage. Chemerinsky concludes that the confirmation process is contentious precisely because justices' decisions are not neutral like an umpire's, and he criticizes Kavanaugh for presenting a misleading view of constitutional law.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the provided text. However, he uses affirmative action as an example to illustrate that Supreme Court justices must make value judgments when deciding if something serves a ""compelling"" government interest. He indicates that constitutional law often involves weighing such interests against constitutional rights, and the decisions cannot be solely based on the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. This suggests that the author believes affirmative action, like other constitutional issues, is subject to interpretation and the personal ideologies of the justices. The perspective presented is that the constitutionality of affirmative action hinges on whether the Court views diversity in education as a compelling interest, which is a decision that goes beyond the text of the Constitution and reflects the justices' values and ideologies."	0.02884	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as indicated by their use of disparaging language to describe it. The terms 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' imply a negative view of affirmative action policies, suggesting that they are seen as unfair or improper allocations based on race. Although the author's primary focus is on the partisanship of Supreme Court confirmations and Brett Kavanaugh's views, the language used to describe affirmative action policies provides insight into the author's stance.	"Summary:
The Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was highly partisan, with Democrats attempting to halt proceedings over withheld documents and Republicans accusing them of political grandstanding. Kavanaugh was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican votes. The process revealed little about Kavanaugh's views, continuing a trend of nominees providing fewer substantive answers. The hearing was compared to the contentious 1991 confirmation of Clarence Thomas. Partisanship in Supreme Court confirmations has increased over the years, with votes becoming more divided along party lines.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is reflected through the commentary on Kavanaugh's past statements. Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, criticized Kavanaugh for his disparaging language regarding affirmative action policies in private White House memos, using terms like ""naked racial set-aside"" and ""racial spoils system."" These terms suggest Kavanaugh views affirmative action as unfair racial preference rather than a means to address systemic racism. The author conveys a sense of concern from liberal scholars and women's rights advocates about Kavanaugh's potential impact on civil rights and his refusal to clearly state his stance on precedents like Roe vs. Wade. Overall, the author portrays a perspective that Kavanaugh's confirmation could pose a threat to affirmative action and other civil rights issues."	0.032119999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt	2
	None	The text provided does not directly address the author's perspective on affirmative action in the context it is most commonly understood, which is to increase opportunities for historically marginalized groups within employment or education. Instead, the text discusses immigration and refugee policies in Europe, with the term 'affirmative action' being used in a different context by Pierre Bertrand to describe Angela Merkel's policy of welcoming Syrian refugees. Since affirmative action in its traditional sense is not discussed or evaluated by the authors of the letters, it is not possible to categorize their stance on the topic.	"Summary:
The text consists of three letters to the editor, each responding to Hillary Clinton's statements about Europe's immigration policies. Pierre Bertrand expresses dismay at Clinton's remarks, which he views as contrary to the spirit of human rights and counterproductive to her previous stance as a human rights advocate. He underscores the importance of the right to seek asylum as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contrasts Clinton's praise for Angela Merkel's acceptance of Syrian refugees with her encouragement of restrictive policies for political gain.

Lorna Salzman praises Clinton for recognizing that uncontrolled immigration has fueled right-wing, populist movements in Europe, attributing this to the left's failure to acknowledge cultural differences between Europeans and refugees from theocratic backgrounds.

Jane Carey argues that the focus on immigration as a cause of the far right's rise is misplaced and that the right uses it as an excuse to push their agenda. Carey suggests that the root causes of immigration, such as wars and climate change, need to be addressed to resolve the issue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The term ""affirmative action"" is used in the first letter to describe Angela Merkel's policy of welcoming Syrian refugees into Germany. The author, Pierre Bertrand, views Merkel's actions as commendable and in line with human rights standards. Bertrand's use of the term ""affirmative actions"" in this context refers to proactive measures taken to protect and accommodate refugees, which he supports. However, the term ""affirmative action"" is more commonly associated with policies aimed at increasing opportunities for historically marginalized groups within employment or education. The letters do not explicitly discuss affirmative action in this more traditional sense but focus on immigration and refugee policies in Europe."	0.025029999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action policies in both Malaysia and the United States suggests a stance that is somewhat against or strongly against these policies. The text argues that affirmative action fails to address the root causes of inequality and may benefit the well-off within targeted groups rather than the poor. The author also points to examples where progress has been made without affirmative action or where the discontinuation of such policies led to better outcomes, indicating skepticism about their efficacy. This perspective implies that the author believes there are more effective ways to achieve economic and racial equality without relying on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the protests in Malaysia where 55,000 people gathered to support race-based policies favoring the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These affirmative action policies have been in place since the 1950s and were intended to expire in 1991 but have been extended for political reasons. The author compares the situation in Malaysia with affirmative action in the United States, highlighting the ongoing debates over such policies in education and their effectiveness in achieving racial balance and economic equality. Reference is made to the lawsuit against Harvard for discrimination against Asian applicants and to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's push for racial quotas in public schools. The author questions the efficacy of affirmative action, citing examples where the intended beneficiaries have not significantly advanced or where progress has been made without such policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action policies, both in Malaysia and the United States. The perspective is that these policies often benefit the well-off within the targeted groups rather than the poor, and they fail to address the root causes of inequality. The author suggests that affirmative action can exacerbate ethnic tensions and may not be the most effective means to improve the economic status of disadvantaged groups. The text points out that in some cases, such as with the Malays in Singapore who do not have affirmative action, or the black middle class in the U.S. before the implementation of such programs, progress has been made without these policies. Additionally, the author highlights instances, like the University of California system, where the discontinuation of race-based admissions led to better outcomes for minority students. Overall, the author seems to advocate for a reevaluation of affirmative action policies and a focus on more direct methods of preparing and empowering disadvantaged groups to succeed on their own merits."	0.02905	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author, Jacob Weisberg, discusses Daniel Patrick Moynihan's perspective on affirmative action in a nuanced way. Weisberg acknowledges Moynihan's support for initiatives to address racial inequality, which includes affirmative action. However, Moynihan also held a critical view of the liberal left's approach to policy-making, which suggests that while he was in favor of affirmative action, he had reservations about the methods employed to implement these policies. Weisberg doesn't express a personal stance on affirmative action but rather provides an analysis of Moynihan's position, highlighting his support for the principles of affirmative action in conjunction with a critique of the left's rigidity and political correctness. This indicates that Weisberg is presenting an objective view of Moynihan's stance without necessarily advocating for or against affirmative action himself.	"**Summary:**
Jacob Weisberg's article presents a complex portrait of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a U.S. Senator known for his intellectual prowess and his role in shaping discussions on various policies, although not for passing significant legislation. Moynihan is depicted as a figure whose career was marked by his critical intelligence and his ability to bring historical and social science insights into political discourse. Despite his contributions, Moynihan is seen as someone who struggled to translate his ideas into effective political action, often hindered by his temperament, pride, and a tendency to prioritize being right over being influential.

**Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:**
Weisberg's portrayal of Moynihan's perspective on affirmative action is multifaceted. Moynihan, who was involved in early discussions about the black family and social policies, supported initiatives to address racial inequality, including affirmative action. However, his support was not without criticism; he believed that liberal left's rigidity and political correctness were obstacles to effective policy-making. Moynihan's 1965 report on the black family, while not explicitly about affirmative action, influenced subsequent discussions on the subject, and his support for policies to strengthen the black family can be seen as aligning with the goals of affirmative action.

Moynihan's support for affirmative action was also tied to his broader views on social policy and his experiences with the backlash from the left. His willingness to engage with affirmative action and related policies was part of his commitment to addressing racial inequality, even as he faced criticism from various quarters. Overall, Weisberg suggests that Moynihan's approach to affirmative action was consistent with his complex and often contradictory political persona—one that supported the principles of affirmative action but was critical of the left's approach to social policy."	0.11829	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to view the college admissions scandal as evidence that elite colleges favor wealthy students, which implies support for affirmative action as a counterbalance to this inequity. The scandal is presented as an argument that strengthens the case for affirmative action, rather than as a point against it. The author's defense of affirmative action is implied through the criticism of wealth bias in college admissions and the suggestion that affirmative action helps to address this imbalance by supporting minority admissions.	"Summary:
The text provided discusses various instances where political figures, including President Trump, have been involved in amplifying divisive or discriminatory rhetoric, particularly related to Islamophobia, political disputes, and racial issues. Trump is criticized for his comments on Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro's remarks about Rep. Omar's hijab and for his derogatory tweets about the late Sen. John McCain. The college admissions scandal has reignited debates over affirmative action, with some arguing it shows that elite colleges favor wealthy students over minorities. Sen. Amy Klobuchar criticizes Trump for stoking racial and religious hatred, which is echoed by Chris Wallace of Fox News, who links Trump's rhetoric to the language of the Christchurch shooter. The text also mentions an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker who was egged for his remarks on the New Zealand shootings. Lastly, Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege is contrasted with his emphasis on his unique perspective as a candidate from the U.S./Mexico border, which the author suggests might overshadow other candidates with similar backgrounds.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to defend affirmative action policies, suggesting that the college admissions scandal has highlighted the larger issue of class privilege in elite college admissions rather than undermining the rationale for affirmative action. They indicate that the scandal may actually support the argument that colleges are biased in favor of wealthy students, rather than against minorities. The author implies that the defense of racial preferences is justified because the presence of minority students at elite colleges is overshadowed by the number of students who gain admission due to their family's wealth. This perspective suggests that the author believes affirmative action is necessary to counterbalance the advantages of wealth in college admissions and to promote diversity and equal opportunity."	0.02343	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt	2
	None	The author, Dr. Berry, discusses the challenges she faces in academia as an African-American woman and does not explicitly state her stance on affirmative action. She mentions the negative impact of the backlash against affirmative action on the perception of qualifications for individuals like herself. However, her focus is more on the respect she commands through her title and the representation of diversity in her field rather than on the policy of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined as strongly or somewhat in favor, neutral, somewhat against, or strongly against. She is primarily concerned with the issues of respect and representation, not affirmative action policy.	"Summary:
Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, discusses the importance of titles in academia, particularly for women and people of color. She describes the challenges she faces in a predominantly white and male-dominated field, including students questioning her qualifications and expertise. Berry insists on being called ""Dr. Berry"" in the classroom to command respect and to serve as a role model for other female and black students. She highlights the low representation of African-American women in engineering academia and expresses her desire to change the face of engineering to reflect diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dr. Berry, acknowledges that affirmative action policies have been criticized and delegitimized by opponents, which has negatively impacted the reputation of individuals who might be perceived as beneficiaries of such policies. She asserts that she did not benefit from affirmative action, yet she is aware that some students may presume she is less qualified or was hired to fulfill a diversity quota. Dr. Berry's perspective is that the backlash against affirmative action has added to the challenges faced by women and people of color in academia, as it fosters a climate where their qualifications and competencies are more readily questioned or undermined. Despite this, she does not explicitly advocate for or against affirmative action; rather, she focuses on her personal experiences and the need to assert her professional title to gain the respect afforded automatically to her white male colleagues."	0.02765	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author references The Washington Post's editorial, which supports the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policies. The editorial emphasizes the importance of a 'conscientiously designed' program for diversity, indicating that the author views affirmative action positively when it is implemented carefully and aims to enhance diversity. The author agrees with the approach of using race as one of many factors in a holistic review process to achieve diversity in education.	"Summary:
The provided text is a compilation of editorial perspectives from various newspapers on different issues. The New York Times editorial discusses a bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy aimed at ending the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records, promoting transparency, and establishing a panel to advocate for privacy rights. The Washington Post editorial supports the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policies, emphasizing the importance of a ""conscientiously designed"" program for diversity. The Boston Globe comments on the Massachusetts State Legislature's response to Supreme Court objections to a 'buffer-zone' law, proposing a new law to regulate protests at abortion clinics. The Guardian praises Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, for her focus on increasing wages, not just reducing unemployment. The Globe and Mail addresses the issue of honeybee die-offs, noting progress in managing the problem and a hopeful outlook. The Korea Herald criticizes Japan's rejection of a U.N. Committee on Human Rights recommendation to investigate wartime sex slavery and apologize to the victims, noting the tension it creates with other Asian countries.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, referencing The Washington Post's editorial, presents a positive view of affirmative action policies, specifically those implemented by the University of Texas at Austin. The Post describes the university's admissions policy as a ""prime example"" of the kind that should pass judicial scrutiny, suggesting that the author supports affirmative action initiatives that aim to enhance diversity through careful and holistic review processes. The policy in question complements a race-neutral top 10 percent program with a more comprehensive review that considers race as one of many factors, which the author seems to agree is a cautious and appropriate approach to achieving diversity in educational settings."	0.02864	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	Each author discussed in the summary expresses support for affirmative action, critiquing the 'mismatch' theory and arguing for the necessity and benefits of affirmative action policies. Kidder, Jordan, McAlevey, and Jelks all provide arguments that either directly support affirmative action or undermine criticisms of it, such as the mismatch theory.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss the concept of affirmative action and its implications in the context of higher education. William Kidder critiques the ""mismatch"" theory, which suggests that affirmative action can harm minorities by placing them in schools where they are unqualified, pointing out that many scholars have identified methodological flaws in the research supporting this theory. He emphasizes that the bulk of peer-reviewed research does not support the mismatch hypothesis. Rosiland Jordan argues that affirmative action is necessary because society values degrees from certain institutions more highly and that the stigma attached to minority students would not exist if the education system was equitable from primary school onwards. Jane McAlevey contends that affirmative action should continue until a better solution to racism is found and proven effective. Randal Maurice Jelks criticizes the assumptions of mismatch theory, particularly its reliance on test scores, and highlights the success of historically black colleges in educating black students.

Author's Perspectives on Affirmative Action:
- William Kidder views affirmative action positively, suggesting that the mismatch theory is not supported by a preponderance of research and that affirmative action does not harm minority students.
- Rosiland Jordan supports affirmative action as a means to equalize the power conferred by degrees from prestigious institutions. She believes the stigma against minority students would disappear if the education system treated all students equally from the start.
- Jane McAlevey also supports affirmative action, seeing it as a necessary measure until systemic racism is effectively addressed and a better solution is implemented.
- Randal Maurice Jelks criticizes the foundations of the mismatch theory and supports affirmative action, noting the success of historically black colleges and universities in nurturing black talent, which challenges the assumptions of mismatch theory."	0.02473	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Kurt Andersen, mentions affirmative action as part of a list of positive liberal policies enacted under Nixon's administration. While the main focus of the text is not affirmative action, Andersen's inclusion of it alongside other progressive initiatives suggests that he views it in a positive light. However, since affirmative action is not the central topic of the article and is only mentioned in passing, it is not possible to definitively categorize Andersen's stance as 'strongly in favor.' Instead, the author seems to be 'somewhat in favor,' as he acknowledges affirmative action as part of a broader liberal agenda that he appears to endorse.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of President Obama's negotiation tactics during the debt ceiling agreement, as seen through the eyes of a successful Hollywood dealmaker. The dealmaker criticizes Obama for not using the 14th Amendment as leverage against the Republicans and for being too transparent and reasonable, rather than ambiguous and threatening as Richard Nixon might have been. The author, Kurt Andersen, reflects on Nixon's presidency, highlighting his liberal policies which included environmental protection, civil rights, and social welfare initiatives, contrasting them with the current Republican stance. Andersen notes that Nixon's ""Madman Theory"" was a strategic bluff, unlike what he perceives as the actual recklessness of the contemporary GOP. The author's mother, a lifelong Republican voter, is cited as someone who would have been shocked by the current state of the party, suggesting that even Nixon himself might have been surprised.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Kurt Andersen, appears to view affirmative action positively as part of Nixon's progressive policies. He points out that Nixon's administration began affirmative action in federal hiring, which he presents as an example of Nixon's unexpected liberal governance. Andersen's overall perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the article, but by including it among the list of commendable policies of Nixon's presidency, he implies a favorable view of the practice."	0.027390000000000005	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on the Federalist Society's influence and its members' dissatisfaction with certain policies, including affirmative action. The author's own stance on affirmative action is not directly addressed; however, the context suggests that the Federalist Society, which is the subject of the text, is critical of affirmative action policies. The author's perspective can only be inferred indirectly through the description of the Society's views.	"Summary:
The text describes an event at the Mayflower Hotel where Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor, expressed anger during the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala. Although it was a time of celebration for the Federalist Society, which had gained significant influence in the legal realm, Graglia and other conservatives voiced dissatisfaction with current policies and enforcement of laws, such as antitrust laws and state lawsuits against tobacco companies. The author reflects on the shift from the Federalist Society members being law students grumbling about affirmative action to now setting legal policies and selecting judges. The text also highlights the continued grievances and attacks on liberal figures and policies, despite the conservatives' current dominance. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans to be vigilant in reviewing judicial nominees and standing up for mainstream principles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions that the last time they spent time with the Federalist Society crowd was on the Harvard Law Review, where conservative law students would ""grumble about affirmative action and the New Deal."" This suggests that the Federalist Society members, including Lino Graglia, were critical of affirmative action policies. The author does not delve deeply into their own views on affirmative action within this text, but the context implies that the Federalist Society's perspective is against such policies, as part of a broader conservative agenda that opposes many liberal legal and policy interventions."	0.02749	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's letter focuses on the ideological diversity of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet selections, using affirmative action as an example to illustrate this diversity. The mention of General Colin L. Powell's differing stance on affirmative action is used to counter the critique that Bush's cabinet lacks ideological diversity. However, the author does not delve into his own perspective on affirmative action, nor does he critique or support the policy directly. Instead, he argues for the importance of having cabinet members who align with the President's beliefs for their roles. The context suggests that the author views the inclusion of diverse opinions, such as Powell's support for affirmative action, as a strength, but this is not the main focus of the letter. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
Michael Teachout, in his letter to the editor, responds to a critique of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet selections, which the editorial characterized as lacking ""significant ideological diversity."" Teachout counters this criticism by pointing out that there has been no similar expectation for President Clinton to appoint cabinet members with opposing views on key issues like abortion rights or conservative policies. He notes that Bush's cabinet does include members with different viewpoints (e.g., General Colin L. Powell on affirmative action, Governor Christie Whitman on abortion), but emphasizes that these members align with the President's beliefs for their specific roles. Teachout also reminds that the U.S. government's structure, with its three branches, inherently creates a balance of power, suggesting that it is unnecessary and counterproductive for a president to appoint cabinet members with whom he cannot work effectively.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the letter does not provide an extensive discussion on affirmative action, it does mention General Colin L. Powell as an example of a cabinet member who holds a different opinion from President-elect Bush on the issue. This reference implies that Powell supports affirmative action, and it is presented in the context of demonstrating ideological diversity within Bush's cabinet. The author does not explicitly express his own stance on affirmative action, but he seems to view the inclusion of differing perspectives on such policies within the cabinet as a positive attribute, as long as the overall alignment with the President's beliefs for their appointed positions is maintained."	0.02049	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	2
	None	The author of the text does not directly address their stance on affirmative action. The discussion revolves around the political tactics used by Senator Ashcroft and the Republican majority in Congress, specifically in the context of Justice Ronnie White's nomination. The author's criticism is aimed at the misuse of affirmative action as a political tool rather than the policy itself. Therefore, the text does not provide sufficient information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author criticizes the 106th Congress, particularly the Republican majority, for what they perceive as cynical and hypocritical actions. Examples given include the appointment of conferees who oppose a patient rights bill, the allocation of additional profits to student loan companies, and the passage of bills that undermine states' rights and environmental protections. The author is particularly appalled by the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White's nomination to a federal judgeship, orchestrated by Senator John Ashcroft, who falsely accused White of being ""pro-criminal"" and biased against the death penalty. The author refutes these claims, noting White's record of upholding death sentences and endorsements from law enforcement. The author suggests Ashcroft's motives were political, aimed at bolstering his tough-on-crime image for re-election. The author concludes that the Republicans' actions in rejecting White were not racially motivated but were instead a display of partisanship and a smear against a reputable judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action within the text. However, they do mention a case where the issue of affirmative action was falsely brought up by Senator Ashcroft as a reason for Justice White's dissent in a death penalty case. The author clarifies that Ashcroft's claim was a ""brazen falsehood,"" suggesting that the author is critical of using affirmative action as a misleading or manipulative argument in political contexts. The author's focus is more on the integrity of the judicial confirmation process and the political maneuvering within Congress rather than on affirmative action itself."	0.02576	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be one of cautious support. They acknowledge the good intentions behind the policy and the desire of its advocates to avoid a potentially damaging Supreme Court ruling. However, the author also points out the legal vulnerabilities of affirmative action and suggests that the Piscataway case may not have been the best case to defend the broader application of the policy. The author's emphasis on finding a more suitable legal battleground indicates a belief in the value of affirmative action but also a concern about the potential for legal setbacks if cases are not chosen wisely.	"Summary:
The text discusses the resolution of a lawsuit in Piscataway, New Jersey, where a white teacher, Sharon Taxman, was dismissed in favor of a black teacher in an effort to preserve racial diversity within the school's faculty. Taxman won a judgment for back pay and legal fees, and a coalition of civil rights groups facilitated the settlement by contributing to 70% of the $433,500 judgment. The case was poised to be heard by the Supreme Court, which led to concerns among affirmative action advocates that the Court might not only rule against the specific race-based decision but also potentially outlaw the use of racial criteria in all employment contexts. The case was settled before the Supreme Court could hear it, which supporters of affirmative action saw as a wise decision, given the complexity of the case and the potential implications for affirmative action policies nationwide.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as a well-intentioned but potentially legally vulnerable policy. They suggest that the Piscataway case was not the ideal case to be used as a test for the legality of affirmative action due to its ""unusual facts""—both teachers had equal seniority and comparable qualifications, and the decision to lay off a white teacher was based on maintaining diversity within a specific department rather than addressing past discrimination. The author indicates that the Supreme Court will eventually need to tackle the issue of whether race can be considered in employment decisions under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, they imply that it would be better for this debate to occur with a case that more clearly addresses the core legal issues, rather than one with the peculiarities of the Piscataway situation. The author also notes the Clinton Administration's reversal on the case, suggesting a recognition of its legal and possibly political complexities. Overall, the author seems to support the goals of affirmative action but is cautious about the legal strategies used to defend it."	0.024120000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to support the use of affirmative action, particularly in instances where it serves to promote racial diversity and combat discrimination. The text indicates that the author believes in the strategic necessity of affirmative action policies and criticizes the absolutist color-blind approach. The author's acknowledgment of the need for targeted recruitment efforts and the view that racial diversity is a compelling interest in certain contexts, such as in police departments or educational institutions, further suggests a favorable stance towards affirmative action. However, the author's perspective is nuanced, recognizing the complexity of the issue and the need for affirmative action policies to be 'narrowly tailored' to pass constitutional muster. This nuanced approach, along with the criticism of the school board's specific action as incorrect, indicates that while the author supports affirmative action, they also recognize the importance of adhering to legal frameworks and the potential for affirmative action to be misapplied.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton Administration's shift in stance on a Supreme Court case involving affirmative action. Initially, the Administration supported the Piscataway, N.J., school board's decision to lay off a white teacher to maintain racial diversity by keeping an equally qualified black teacher. However, they later conceded that this action violated the civil rights of the white teacher. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that racial preferences can only be constitutional to remedy overt discrimination or serve a ""compelling"" public goal and must be ""narrowly tailored."" The Administration's new brief suggests a compromise, arguing that while the school board's specific action was incorrect, affirmative action still has a place beyond remedying past discrimination. The text also mentions California's ban on race-based public hiring and a Federal appeals court ruling against the use of racial diversity as a compelling state interest in the University of Texas Law School case.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, arguing that the Administration's compromise is a strategic move to preserve the policy amidst a challenging judicial environment. The author believes that racial diversity can be a compelling interest in specific contexts, such as in police departments or educational institutions, and that a color-blind approach to public employment is not feasible if the goal is to prevent racial discrimination. The text suggests that recruitment efforts targeting minorities are necessary to prevent discrimination, even if they conflict with a color-blind principle. Furthermore, the author contends that racial diversity on the Federal bench is a compelling public interest and implies that the Supreme Court should recognize the value of affirmative action in promoting racial diversity. Overall, the author is critical of absolutist opponents of affirmative action and cautions against the Supreme Court adopting an absolutist color-blind view that would undermine efforts to combat racial discrimination."	0.03107	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	Timothy R. Cahn's letter indicates that he supports affirmative action, as he believes it is necessary to correct an admissions process that does not naturally result in a student body reflective of society's racial diversity. He acknowledges the argument made by Matsuda and Lawrence but adds a different dimension to the justification for affirmative action, highlighting systemic issues in the admissions process rather than focusing solely on overt discrimination. Cahn's argument suggests that affirmative action is needed to ensure equal representation and opportunity, which indicates that he is in favor of affirmative action, with a particular emphasis on its role in addressing systemic imbalances in university admissions.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor, written by Timothy R. Cahn and published on April 4, 1996, responds to an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence regarding affirmative action. Cahn acknowledges the argument made by Matsuda and Lawrence but suggests they missed a critical point in justifying the need for affirmative action. He argues that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admissions based on race, the lack of proportionate racial representation in universities must result from non-merit-based factors. Cahn believes that affirmative action is necessary, not simply to address overt discrimination as Matsuda and Lawrence suggest, but to correct an admissions process that fails to produce university classes that reflect society's racial diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Timothy R. Cahn, supports affirmative action but differs slightly in his reasoning from the perspective presented by Matsuda and Lawrence. Cahn agrees with the need for affirmative action but emphasizes that its purpose is to correct an admissions process that inadvertently results in a lack of racial representation that mirrors society, rather than solely to combat overt discrimination. He implies that affirmative action is a mechanism to ensure that university classes are demographically representative when merit-based admissions alone do not achieve this outcome. Cahn's perspective suggests a systemic issue in the admissions process that affirmative action seeks to remedy, ensuring equal representation and opportunity for all racial groups."	0.01876	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Evan Edwards, indicates that being against affirmative action does not equate to being anti-women, suggesting a belief that affirmative action is not essential for supporting women's rights or gender equality. This implies a critical view of affirmative action, as Edwards seems to advocate for merit and qualifications over affirmative action policies. However, since the text does not provide a detailed argument or strong language specifically about affirmative action, but rather a general defense of the Republican Party's policies and positions, it is difficult to categorize Edwards as 'strongly against'. Therefore, the author's stance is categorized as 'somewhat against' affirmative action.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor is a response to Frank Rich's column discussing Tanya Melich's departure from the Republican Party. The author, Evan Edwards, criticizes Melich, calling her a ""fink"" and arguing that the Republican Party, particularly in New York City, is liberal to ultra-liberal, as opposed to the ultra-right elements she may be referring to. Edwards cites the formation of the New York State Conservative Party as evidence of the Republican Party's liberal leanings and defends the party's inclusiveness by mentioning that an AIDS activist spoke at the 1992 Republican convention. Additionally, Edwards highlights the party's history of appointing women to high positions, including the Supreme Court. He asserts that the Republican Party's foundation is for moderates to conservatives and that being against affirmative action or welfare abuse does not equate to being anti-women. Edwards concludes by suggesting that Melich is more aligned with the Democratic Party, particularly with figures like Ruth Messinger.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Evan Edwards, seems to hold a critical view of affirmative action. He suggests that the Republican Party's stance against affirmative action does not make it anti-women. This implies that Edwards likely views affirmative action as a policy that may not be necessary or beneficial in achieving gender equality or that it could potentially move the party away from its core beliefs. His perspective seems to be that merit and qualifications should take precedence over affirmative action policies."	0.02094	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's discussion of the need for reparations and the importance of addressing historical and ongoing racial injustices indicates a strong support for measures aimed at correcting racial disparities, which includes affirmative action. The author's frustration with those who believe affirmative action is no longer needed and the emphasis on systemic issues such as wage gaps, workplace representation, healthcare inequities, and environmental racism, further underscore a deep concern for the well-being of black communities and a belief in proactive steps to ensure equality. The support for reparations, as part of these measures, aligns with a strong endorsement of affirmative action as a tool for social justice.	"Summary:
The text discusses a House Judiciary panel hearing on H.R. 40, a proposal for a commission to study reparations for slavery against black Americans. The hearing coincided with Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in Texas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposed reparations, arguing that civil rights legislation and the election of Barack Obama addressed the issue. The author refutes this, highlighting ongoing racial injustices and the importance of acknowledging and addressing the legacy of slavery. The author supports reparations and calls for a national reckoning with America's history of racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a necessary measure to address ongoing racial disparities and injustices. They express frustration with those who believe affirmative action is no longer needed, pointing out that the effects of historical racism continue to impact black Americans. The author bears witness to systemic issues like wage gaps, unequal representation in the workplace, healthcare inequities, and environmental racism, such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. They argue that affirmative action is part of the broader effort to rectify past wrongs and support the well-being of black communities. The author's perspective is that affirmative action, along with reparations and other measures, is essential for healing and progress."	0.02563	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but can be inferred from the content of the article. The author's positive portrayal of diversity and inclusivity, as well as the discussion of the benefits of a mixed-race society in Hawaii, suggest a perspective that aligns with the goals of affirmative action. The author's emphasis on the importance of breaking down racial barriers and promoting a harmonious, equitable society indicates a favorable view towards policies that encourage diversity, which includes affirmative action. However, since the article does not specifically address affirmative action, the stance can be considered somewhat in favor rather than strongly in favor, as the support is implied rather than overtly stated.	"Summary:
The article reflects on the concept of race and how it is perceived differently in Hawaii compared to the mainland United States. The author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, shares the experiences of Dr. Kristin Pauker, a psychology professor of mixed ancestry, who felt out of place at Dartmouth College due to her ethnicity. In Hawaii, where mixed-race individuals are common and constitute a significant portion of the population, race is seen as a more fluid concept and less associated with stereotypes. Dr. Pauker's research indicates that children in Hawaii do not hold the same essentialist views of race as children from predominantly white neighborhoods in Boston. The author also explores the history of race relations in Hawaii, the impact of labor organizing on racial harmony, and the potential lessons that can be learned from Hawaii's approach to race and diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the article does not directly address affirmative action, the author's perspective can be inferred from the discussion on the benefits of diversity, the history of labor organizing in Hawaii, and the research findings of Dr. Pauker and others. The author seems to support efforts that promote diversity and inclusivity, as evidenced by the positive portrayal of Hawaii's mixed-race society and the mention of labor organizing that deliberately ensured equal representation of all ethnic groups. The article suggests that such measures can lead to a more harmonious and equitable society, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action. The author also highlights the potential cognitive and social benefits of diversity, further implying that policies like affirmative action, which aim to increase diversity and break down racial barriers, may have a positive impact beyond just addressing historical injustices."	0.08751	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author, Harry Piotrowski, seems to criticize the inconsistency between Ronald Reagan and Antonin Scalia's stated opposition to affirmative action and the actions taken during Scalia's appointment to the Supreme Court. Piotrowski's identification of this irony suggests a negative view of their stance on affirmative action, which could indicate that the author is somewhat against their perspective. However, without explicit support for or against affirmative action policies in the text, it is challenging to determine Piotrowski's own stance on the issue. The author's critique focuses more on the perceived hypocrisy rather than affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text consists of three letters to the editor responding to news stories about the selection of a Supreme Court justice. Robert B. Newlin from Arlington suggests that President Obama should nominate an ""ordinary person"" to the Supreme Court, someone who is a logical thinker and problem-solver from outside the political sphere, such as a business executive or educator. Richard L. Sheffield from Columbia criticizes the use of the word ""ordinary"" to describe Americans, as the dictionary definitions carry connotations of being inferior or unexceptional, and suggests simply using ""Americans"" instead. Harry Piotrowski from Crofton highlights the irony in Ronald Reagan appointing Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court because of his Italian heritage, despite Reagan and Scalia's apparent opposition to affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Harry Piotrowski, expresses a critical view of affirmative action by pointing out the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court. Piotrowski suggests that Reagan's decision was influenced by an ""emotional commitment"" to have someone of ""Italian extraction"" on the Court, which contradicts the notion that appointments should be strictly merit-based—an ideal that both Reagan and Scalia purportedly supported. The author implies that Scalia and Reagan's public opposition to affirmative action does not align with the actions taken in Scalia's appointment. Piotrowski's tone suggests skepticism towards Scalia's belief in his own merit and hints at the hypocrisy in the conservative stance against affirmative action."	0.02224	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action but discusses the Supreme Court's role in aligning with social progress and public sentiment, which includes upholding affirmative action in the past. The author's recognition of the court's decisions involving a dialogue with society and the mention of the court upholding affirmative action suggests a nuanced view that is likely positive towards affirmative action. However, without a direct statement of support or opposition, it's challenging to categorize the author's stance definitively. The author seems to be more focused on the role of the Supreme Court in social change rather than on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The article reflects on a week of Supreme Court decisions that carried significant implications for various groups and policies in the United States. The central focus is on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case, where the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled 5-4 against the Trump administration's attempt to end the program. Roberts' opinion emphasized the inadequacy of the administration's explanation for terminating DACA, labeling it ""arbitrary and capricious,"" and highlighted the reliance interests of the Dreamers and their communities. The article also touches on the court's decision to protect LGBTQ rights in the workplace and contemplates the evolving role of the Supreme Court in reflecting public sentiment and social change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court as an institution that historically realigns itself with public expectations and societal shifts. This perspective is evidenced by the mention of the 2002-2003 term under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, where the court upheld affirmative action in higher education. The author suggests that the court's decisions, including those on affirmative action, are not solely legal questions but also involve the court's dialogue with society. The author seems to appreciate the court's role in upholding affirmative action as part of its broader responsibility to adapt to and reflect social progress."	0.033280000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Jennifer Lee, presents a clear and supportive stance toward affirmative action. She addresses concerns about racial quotas being unconstitutional and asserts that affirmative action would be beneficial for Asian Americans, contrary to the fears of some conservative Asian immigrant groups. Lee argues that Proposition 209 did not lead to increased admissions for Asian Americans in the University of California system and that affirmative action is necessary to address career ceilings and systemic inequalities. She also cites the majority support for affirmative action among Asian Americans, particularly U.S.-born and third-plus-generation individuals. Her discussion of the rise in anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for Asian Americans to support affirmative action to create a more equitable opportunity structure further underscores her favorable view of such policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the opportunity for California voters to repeal Proposition 209 through Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5, which would restore affirmative action in the state. Proposition 209, enacted in 1996, banned the consideration of race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, contracting, and education. Supporters of affirmative action argue that ACA 5 would address historical and systematic inequalities, while opponents, including some conservative Asian immigrants, believe it would harm their children's chances in university admissions by imposing an Asian quota. The author refutes this concern, stating that racial quotas are unconstitutional and that the amendment would benefit Asian Americans. They note that Proposition 209 did not increase Asian American admissions to the University of California system and that affirmative action is necessary to address blocked mobility and career ceilings in various fields, such as technology, law, and academia. The author also highlights the rise in anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic and points out that the majority of Asian Americans support affirmative action, especially U.S.-born and third-plus-generation Asians. The text concludes by urging Asian Americans to support affirmative action to create a more equitable opportunity structure.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jennifer Lee, is a strong proponent of affirmative action. She believes that affirmative action is essential for addressing systemic inequalities that affect marginalized communities, including Asian Americans. Lee argues that Proposition 209 did not benefit Asian Americans in university admissions and that affirmative action is necessary to overcome barriers in employment and career advancement. She provides evidence that despite being well-represented in student populations at elite universities, Asian Americans face a glass ceiling in professional advancement and are underrepresented in leadership positions.

Lee also contends that race-neutral policies are insufficient in addressing the racial realities and discrimination faced by Asian Americans, as demonstrated by the increase in anti-Asian hate incidents during the pandemic. She emphasizes that the majority of Asian American voters support affirmative action and that it is crucial for the new generation of Asian Americans to advocate for equitable opportunities in education, employment, and contracting. Lee's perspective is that affirmative action does not create an unfair advantage but rather helps to level the playing field for historically disadvantaged groups, including Asian Americans. She encourages Asian Americans to demonstrate their support for affirmative action at the ballot box."	0.033839999999999995	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the DOJ's support for lawsuits against affirmative action under the Trump administration, implying a belief that affirmative action is a necessary measure for civil rights and diversity in education. Their advocacy for a DOJ that enforces civil rights laws suggests they support measures such as affirmative action to promote equality and address historical injustices.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice (DOJ), highlighting its post-Civil War establishment aimed at replacing private attorneys with professional staff under the supervision of the attorney general, and its new responsibility to enforce civil rights for African Americans. The author expresses dismay at the perceived partisanship and lack of professionalism in the DOJ under the Trump administration and Attorney General William P. Barr, citing interference with policy, leniency for political allies, and a weak stance on civil rights enforcement. The text suggests that reducing the scope of federal criminal law could help prevent politicized law enforcement and calls for a return to the DOJ's founding principles of professionalism and impartiality, particularly in the area of civil rights.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text is critical of the Trump administration's stance on affirmative action, particularly the DOJ's support for lawsuits against affirmative action in college admissions. This criticism implies that the author views affirmative action as a positive or necessary measure for civil rights and diversity in education, and that the DOJ's actions under Trump and Barr represent a departure from the department's mission to protect civil rights. The author seems to advocate for a DOJ that actively enforces civil rights laws and supports measures like affirmative action to promote equality and redress historical injustices."	0.02095	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be critical of Ronald Reagan's approach to affirmative action, highlighting Reagan's attempts to abolish the policy and framing it as part of a broader regressive stance on civil rights. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action is necessary to address systemic inequalities and that Reagan's opposition to it was detrimental to race relations. This criticism of Reagan's efforts to dismantle affirmative action indicates that the author likely views the policy as a positive force for social justice and is therefore in favor of it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the racial politics of Ronald Reagan and draws parallels to those of Donald Trump, especially in the context of their appeal to white voters and their impact on race relations in America. It highlights Reagan's use of racially coded language and dog whistles, such as ""states' rights,"" ""law and order,"" and ""welfare queens,"" which resonated with white middle-class taxpayers. Reagan's political career included opposition to civil rights legislation and fair housing acts, and he capitalized on fears of African Americans moving into white neighborhoods. His presidency saw attempts to weaken the Voting Rights Act, efforts to abolish affirmative action, and the escalation of the ""war on drugs,"" which disproportionately affected Black Americans. The author argues that while Reagan's racism was less overt than Trump's, it was more insidious and laid the groundwork for Trump's rise.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Ronald Reagan's stance on affirmative action, indicating that Reagan's administration sought to abolish it. The author suggests that Reagan viewed affirmative action as a form of reverse discrimination against white men, despite its intent to address historical and systemic inequalities faced by minority groups. The author implies that Reagan's opposition to affirmative action was part of a broader regressive approach to civil rights, which negatively impacted race relations and contributed to the racial inequalities that persist in American society."	0.029679999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, Melanye Price, is not directly discussing affirmative action as a policy but rather is addressing the perception of Kamala Harris's selection as a vice-presidential candidate being attributed to affirmative action. Price's perspective is that Harris's nomination is a result of the political power, influence, and hard work of Black women, not an outcome of affirmative action policies. The author believes that the nomination is a deserved recognition of Black women's contributions and should not be undermined by suggesting it is a token gesture. Therefore, the author's stance is not directly about affirmative action as a policy; rather, the author argues against the perception of Harris's nomination being an outcome of such a policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the significance of Senator Kamala Harris's selection as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, emphasizing the role of Black women in shaping the political landscape. It argues that Harris's nomination is not merely a token gesture of affirmative action but rather the culmination of the political power and influence of Black women within the Democratic Party. The author notes that Black women have historically had high voter turnout rates and have demonstrated loyalty to the Democratic Party. Black women have also been instrumental in organizing grassroots efforts, registering voters, and winning elections across the country. The text highlights that this moment is built upon the legacy of Black women's struggle for voting rights and their commitment to universal rights. Organizations led by Black women have been pivotal in supporting Black female candidates and demanding accountability from political figures. The selection of Harris is seen as a collective victory for Black women, acknowledging their contributions and aspirations within the political realm.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melanye Price, takes a stance against the notion that Kamala Harris's selection as the vice-presidential candidate is a result of affirmative action. Price argues that such a view overlooks the extensive political work and strategic organization by Black women over the years. The author underscores that Harris's nomination is a reflection of the growing political power and sophistication of Black women, who have been consistently loyal to the Democratic Party and have actively participated in the political process through voter mobilization and advocacy. The author suggests that the selection of Harris is a recognition of the merit and political influence of Black women, rather than an affirmative action pick. Price emphasizes that the historic moment is a testament to the decades of activism, political labor, and unwavering commitment of Black women to advancing their political representation and addressing issues that affect their community."	0.02988	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses admiration for Ruth Bader Ginsburg's approach to legal issues, including her methodical and context-driven analysis of affirmative action cases. By highlighting Ginsburg's meticulous use of data to demonstrate disparities and her recognition of 'centuries of law-sanctioned inequality,' the author aligns with Ginsburg's support for affirmative action programs. The text suggests that the author shares Ginsburg's belief in the necessity of addressing systemic discrimination through such programs, indicating a stance that is in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author reflects on their admiration for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who they first encountered at a conference for women lawyers in the 1970s. Ginsburg, a pioneer in the fight for gender equality, was seen as a role model for civil rights lawyers. Her vision of equality transcended traditional gender roles, advocating for both sexes to pursue any societal role without prejudice. As a litigator, Ginsburg had an impressive record before the Supreme Court and, as a Justice, she was known for her incremental approach to legal change and respect for precedent. She was critical of Roe v. Wade for its sweeping approach and was considered a ""judicial-restraint liberal."" Ginsburg applied precedents within their social and historical contexts, as seen in her decisions on gender-based classifications and affirmative action. She brought personal experiences to her legal work, notably dissenting in the Lilly Ledbetter pay discrimination case. Ginsburg's influence extended beyond her own decisions to those of her colleagues and lower-court judges. In later years, she became a more frequent dissenter as the court's composition changed. The author, who gave the Ruth Bader Ginsburg address years later, highlights Ginsburg's warmth and humor, and her focus on the importance of personal stories in understanding legal rules.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a strong proponent of affirmative action. Ginsburg's perspective, as interpreted by the author, was informed by her understanding of systemic discrimination and the historical context of racial inequity. Ginsburg would meticulously outline data demonstrating the ongoing disparities in housing, education, and employment to support affirmative action programs. She recognized the enduring effects of ""centuries of law-sanctioned inequality"" and believed in the necessity of addressing systemic discrimination, which prefigured today's debates on the topic. The author's recounting of Ginsburg's approach to affirmative action cases suggests a deep respect for Ginsburg's methodical and context-driven analysis, and a shared belief in the importance of such programs to combat persistent racial inequities."	0.03244	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The text provided does not give a clear indication of the author's stance on affirmative action, as the primary focus is on systemic racial injustices and police accountability rather than on affirmative action policies. The author mentions affirmative action in passing, but this mention is used to illustrate broader racial issues rather than to express a clear opinion on affirmative action itself. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reaction to the announcement that no police officers would be charged directly for the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. Instead, one officer was charged for endangering neighbors. The author criticizes Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's reference to ""mob justice"" when describing protests against police violence towards African-Americans, noting the historical use of actual mob justice in the form of lynchings in the Southern United States. The author emphasizes the African-American community's desire for equal justice under the Constitution and points out the systemic failure to hold police officers accountable for killing Black citizens. The text also touches on the broader impact of such incidents on the African-American community's trust in government and their sense of safety. The author, Melanye Price, shares personal experiences with racism and reflects on the emotional toll of systemic racial injustices.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus specifically on affirmative action, the author does mention it in the context of racial prejudice. The author describes it as something that a high school teacher might suggest would help an African-American student get into a great college, indicating that it is seen as a factor in addressing racial disparities in educational opportunities. However, the author's primary focus is on the broader issues of racial justice and systemic inequality, rather than on affirmative action policies specifically. The mention of affirmative action serves to illustrate the kind of racial awareness and experiences that African-Americans encounter from an early age. The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as recognizing it as a part of the conversation around racial equity, but the text does not provide a detailed analysis or opinion on the policy itself."	0.030080000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's defense of Yale's race-conscious admissions, criticism of the Trump administration's lawsuit, and emphasis on the importance of diversity in higher education indicate a strong support for affirmative action. The author's concern with the underrepresentation of certain groups in faculty positions and the impact of removing race-conscious admissions on diversity further reinforce this stance. The author's commitment to resisting efforts to roll back affirmative action and the view that it is essential for addressing systemic inequalities align with a position that is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author, a former student-body president at Yale University, defends the institution against accusations that it excessively supports students from underrepresented backgrounds. He argues that Yale's progress in addressing its historical ties to slavery and increasing faculty diversity has been slow and insufficient. The author highlights the stark underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American faculty at Yale, emphasizing the need for greater diversity. He criticizes the Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale for alleged discrimination in admissions against Asian American and White applicants. The author points out the negative impact that removing race-conscious admissions would have on diversity at elite colleges, citing a similar case against Harvard. He also discusses the educational disparities faced by students of color in high-poverty public schools. Yale's president has affirmed the university's commitment to maintaining its admissions process, which the author supports. He concludes by expressing determination to resist the Trump administration's efforts to roll back affirmative action and race-conscious admissions in higher education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is a strong proponent of affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies. He believes that these practices are essential for promoting diversity within higher education and for addressing the systemic inequalities that affect students from underrepresented backgrounds. The author views the Trump administration's legal actions against these policies as a threat to the progress made in achieving equity in education. He is committed to defending affirmative action and ensuring that universities like Yale can continue to build a diverse and inclusive student body. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is not only a marker of excellence for an educational institution but also a necessary foundation for the advancement of students who have historically faced educational and systemic barriers."	0.028249999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion reveals a positive view of affirmative action, indicating that they see it as a necessary tool to address historic economic disparities faced by the Black community. The author's mention of affirmative action as an 'important tool for fostering economic equality' and their critique of those who have fought against it suggest a supportive stance. Additionally, their acknowledgment of the progress made by African Americans independent of the Trump administration's claims further reinforces their belief in the efficacy and importance of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author expresses deep frustration and indignation at President Donald Trump's claim that he has done more for the Black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. The author feels that Trump's rhetoric is reminiscent of a slave master's mentality, suggesting that Black people should be grateful for his supposedly benevolent leadership. The author criticizes Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for perpetuating racist stereotypes that portray African Americans as incapable of success without white intervention. The author also highlights the hypocrisy of Trump and Kushner, who both come from inherited wealth, while ignoring the systemic barriers and the historical achievements of the Black community. The author refutes Trump's savior narrative by citing statistics that show the economic progress of African Americans predates Trump's presidency, and emphasizes that affirmative action, which has been fought against, was an important tool for fostering economic equality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is positive and supportive. They view affirmative action as a critical equalizer that aimed to provide a bridge to economic parity for African Americans. The author suggests that the system in the United States has historically offered little or no assistance to Black people, and affirmative action was a means to combat that imbalance. However, the author notes that there has been significant opposition to affirmative action, implying that this opposition is part of the systemic efforts to undermine the progress of the Black community. The author believes that despite the challenges, African Americans have achieved impressive economic gains, which contradicts the notion that they need saving by figures like Trump."	0.02728	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, Richard Rodriguez, expresses a personal opposition to affirmative action based on his own experiences as outlined in his essay collection 'Hunger of Memory.' His stance is derived from the belief that affirmative action can create a cultural and linguistic divide, as he felt distanced from his family and cultural roots through his academic and professional achievements. The summary indicates that Rodriguez's opposition is not merely theoretical but is intertwined with his life story and the personal consequences he faced. Therefore, his position is not just a detached critique but one that is deeply connected to his sense of identity and the sacrifices he perceived as necessary for his success.	"Summary:
The text provided is a review by Phillip Lopate of five essay collections by various authors, highlighting their unique styles, thematic concerns, and intellectual contributions. The collections reviewed are ""On the Contrary"" by Mary McCarthy, ""The Essays of Leonard Michaels"" edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels, ""Speak, Memory"" by Vladimir Nabokov, ""Hunger of Memory"" by Richard Rodriguez, and ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" by Susan Sontag.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Richard Rodriguez, in his collection ""Hunger of Memory,"" takes a personal stance against affirmative action. The author chose to write essays to articulate his political argument through his personal experiences. Rodriguez's opposition to affirmative action is rooted in his own life story as a ""scholarship boy"" from a working-class family. He discusses the cultural and linguistic divide between his private life at home, where Spanish was spoken, and his public life at school, where he learned and used English. Rodriguez believes that while there was a significant loss in his transition from the intimate world of his family to the more public and cultivated world of academia, the gains were necessary. His position on affirmative action is informed by his belief that the policy distances individuals from their cultural roots, as evidenced by his own experience of becoming distanced from his family through academic and professional success. His perspective is characterized by a combination of moral reflection, sardonic detachment, and an underlying sense of longing for the familial connections that were weakened as he assimilated into the mainstream, English-speaking society."	0.03148	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Devon Westhill, expresses concerns about racial injustice and discrimination based on race and sex, specifically in the context of a universal basic income program that excludes certain demographics. Westhill's argument that such exclusionary practices can worsen racial discord and are at odds with the principles of equal opportunity indicates a stance that is critical of affirmative action when it leads to direct discrimination. His viewpoint suggests that he believes in equality and fairness without regard to race or sex, which aligns with a perspective that is somewhat against affirmative action as implemented in the Marin County UBI experiment.	"Summary:
Marin County, California, is initiating an experiment to provide a ""universal basic income"" (UBI) of $1,000 a month to 125 low-income residents, with funding from both the Marin Community Foundation and public funds. However, unlike a similar experiment in Stockton, California, the Marin program specifically targets ""mothers of color,"" excluding white mothers and fathers from eligibility. This approach raises legal concerns due to the California Constitution’s equal-protection clause, which requires strict scrutiny for racial and sex classifications. The author, Devon Westhill, who grew up poor with a white mother in a similar environment, argues that excluding individuals like his mother from such a program constitutes racial injustice. Westhill, who is president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, warns that this could deepen racial discord and taint well-intentioned policies like UBI with accusations of racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Devon Westhill is critical of affirmative action when it results in race and sex discrimination, as he believes is the case with the Marin County UBI experiment. He considers the exclusion of individuals based on race or sex to be a form of racial injustice, even when the intention is to assist those who face significant challenges. Westhill suggests that such policies can exacerbate racial tensions and undermine the potential benefits of programs aimed at addressing poverty. His perspective is rooted in the belief that public assistance programs should not discriminate on the basis of skin color, as it contradicts the principles of equal opportunity and fairness."	0.024040000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses concern about systemic inequities and acknowledges the need for programs to reduce disparities. However, they are critical of the form of affirmative action practiced in elite universities, which they argue benefits already privileged children, often from wealthy, white backgrounds. The author seems to believe in the need for interventions to address inequalities but is critical of the current implementation of affirmative action in certain contexts. The criticism is specific to how affirmative action is applied in elite universities and does not necessarily reflect the author's stance on the broader concept of affirmative action. Given the context, the author appears to be somewhat against the current practice of affirmative action in elite universities but may still support other forms of affirmative action that more directly address systemic inequities.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the media's focus on police violence against Black citizens since George Floyd's murder and acknowledges that other systemic inequities, which may not be as visible or dramatic, have been less covered but are equally, if not more, damaging. The author points out that the average Black man in America has a shorter life expectancy than the average white man, and that racial disparities extend beyond criminal justice to areas like education. The U.S. public education system is highlighted as being inherently unequal, funded by local finances which perpetuate a cycle where poor children attend poor schools and rich children attend rich schools. The author notes that racial segregation in schools has increased, and criticizes the judicial system for upholding this inequality in a historic Supreme Court decision. The author also discusses other systemic issues like legacy admissions in universities, zoning laws that segregate neighborhoods, and a tax system that disproportionately audits the poor, particularly in predominantly Black counties.

The author suggests that while there are no perfect solutions, there are programs that can help reduce these disparities, such as early childhood interventions, baby bonds, child tax credits, job training, and increasing the minimum wage. President Biden's proposal to invest in America aims to reduce child poverty by half, which could be a step in the right direction. The author also notes that framing these interventions as ways to reduce class gaps rather than race gaps may garner more public support.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author criticizes the form of affirmative action that exists in elite universities, where legacy preferences and consideration for large donors act as a form of affirmative action for already privileged children. This is juxtaposed with the broader context of systemic inequities that primarily affect people of color and the poor. The author's perspective seems to be that while affirmative action is intended to address disparities, in some contexts, it perpetuates privilege for the wealthy, often white, minority. The author argues that the current system of affirmative action in elite universities does not effectively address the root causes of racial and economic inequalities and instead reinforces them."	0.04426	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective suggests a clear endorsement of affirmative action as part of California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality. They express concern over the potential rollback of progress in social justice, which includes affirmative action policies, under a new leadership that may deny systemic racial issues. The author's apprehension about the recall of Governor Newsom, due to the possibility that his replacements may not uphold these values, further indicates their support for affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses California's values and how they are reflected in current policies under Governor Gavin Newsom's leadership. These values include protecting natural resources, embracing diversity, tolerance, equality, supporting democracy, and aiding marginalized communities. The author expresses concern that these values are threatened by the potential recall of Newsom, as the leading Republican candidates, particularly Larry Elder, do not support these values. The text argues that California's progress in environmental protection, social justice, voting rights, and social welfare could be reversed if Newsom is recalled, as many Republican candidates deny the existence of racial discrimination and inequality, and oppose the criminal justice reforms that Newsom has implemented.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action and the broader goals of diversity, tolerance, and equality. They reference California's past discriminatory actions, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and ballot measures against immigrant rights and affirmative action, to illustrate the state's evolution towards becoming a more inclusive society. The author fears that the recall of Newsom could jeopardize the state's position as a fighter against intolerance, as the leading Republican recall candidates seem to deny systemic issues of racial discrimination and inequality. This suggests that the author believes affirmative action and similar policies are part of California's commitment to addressing historical injustices and promoting equality."	0.026260000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author presents a critical view of affirmative action by highlighting David Shor's analysis that it, among other progressive issues, may not be as popular with the broader electorate as the Democratic Party assumes. The author's inclusion of this perspective and the suggestion that the party's focus on affirmative action could be politically detrimental indicate a skepticism towards the policy's electoral viability. While the author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, the discussion of it as a potential liability for the Democratic Party suggests that the author may have reservations about its effectiveness or popularity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived left-wing bias in the media and its potential impact on the Democratic Party's electoral success. The author refers to a column by Ezra Klein about David Shor, a progressive election analyst who believes the left's focus on issues that excite its young, educated base could be politically damaging. Shor argues that these issues, such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action, may not resonate with the broader electorate, including voters of color. Progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio and law professor Ian Haney Lopez offer alternative messaging strategies, but the author suggests that Shor's approach of prioritizing popular ideas might be more effective for Democrats to gain and maintain power.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author conveys a critical perspective on affirmative action as part of the broader argument about the media's left-wing bias and its influence on the Democratic Party's policies. The author cites David Shor's assertion that affirmative action, along with other liberal issues, has not been as popular with voters of color as intended. This suggests that the author agrees with the notion that the Democratic Party's focus on such policies, driven by the preferences of its young, educated activists and media supporters, may not align with the desires of the general electorate. The text implies that the author believes the party's commitment to affirmative action and similar policies could be politically costly, echoing Shor's concern that the left's emphasis on issues important to a narrow activist base could lead to electoral setbacks."	0.02769	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they support a traditional form of it that aims to remedy historical discrimination. However, they are critical of what they perceive as an extreme interpretation of affirmative action that advocates for present and future discrimination as a remedy. The author's stance seems to endorse a measured approach to affirmative action that aligns with the principles of true equality and is against radical measures that reduce individuals to demographic categories.	"Summary:
The author expresses deep disillusionment with the current state of American politics, feeling alienated from both major political parties. Having started as a Democrat and later becoming an independent, the author values nonpartisanship and has covered political campaigns with a sense of balance, admiring politicians from both sides who challenge old orthodoxies. However, the author is repulsed by what they see as the Republican Party's abandonment of foundational democratic principles and its embrace of exclusionary Americanism. At the same time, the author criticizes the Democratic Party for abandoning traditional liberalism for a radical focus on identity politics and vengeance, which they see as antithetical to the nation's unifying principles. The author suggests that there is a widening space for an independent candidate or a reformist Democrat to appeal to the broad center of the American electorate, which currently lacks a political home.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author supports a traditional form of affirmative action, akin to the policies of Lyndon B. Johnson, which they believe makes sense as a remedy to historical discrimination. However, the author disagrees with the extreme interpretation of affirmative action as presented by Ibram X. Kendi in ""How to Be an Antiracist."" The author criticizes Kendi's assertion that ""The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination,"" viewing it as a call for social upheaval rather than a path to equality. The author argues that this approach is not in keeping with the principles of true equality and is destructive to the ideal of reducing individuals to more than just a demographic category. The author believes in rededicating to the ideal of true equality, rather than resorting to the radical measures that they feel some in the Democratic Party endorse."	0.03741	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's text does not directly address affirmative action, but their criticism of hate speech laws and concern about the suppression of speech opposing affirmative action suggest a critical view of policies that limit debate. The author's focus on the importance of protecting the expression of ideas, even those that may oppose affirmative action, implies a belief in the value of open discussion and possibly skepticism towards affirmative action policies. However, since the text does not explicitly state the author's stance on affirmative action itself, but rather on the broader issue of speech and debate around such policies, it is not possible to definitively categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers for committing hate crimes, in addition to their state convictions for murder. The author criticizes the federal prosecution for hate crimes as unnecessary and constitutionally dubious, arguing that it punishes thought rather than just action. The author references Jacob Sullum's concerns about double jeopardy and the First Amendment, suggesting that the federal trial served as a symbolic gesture to condemn the murderers' racist beliefs. The text also criticizes the European approach to hate speech and the trend in American universities and legislation to broadly define and punish ""hate speech."" The author concludes by suggesting that the government should focus on its basic responsibilities rather than conducting show trials for moral grandstanding.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is implied through their criticism of the concept of ""hate speech"" and its application in the U.S. The author suggests that ""hate speech"" has become an overly broad term that includes opposition to policies like race-based affirmative action. The author appears to view such opposition as a legitimate expression of ideas that should not be categorized as ""hate speech"" or be subject to censorship. This stance indicates that the author is critical of the suppression of speech opposing affirmative action and may view affirmative action itself as a policy that could be legitimately contested. The author's concern is that labeling opposition to such policies as ""hate speech"" could lead to a slippery slope where a variety of expressions and ideas are censored or punished, infringing on First Amendment rights."	0.028069999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author views affirmative action positively, as indicated by the discussion of Justice O'Connor's shift to support affirmative action and the importance of Judge Jackson's diverse background for the Supreme Court. The author appreciates the evolving perspectives on affirmative action and seems to support diversity in the judiciary, which affirmative action helps to promote. The author also criticizes the scrutiny of nominees like Jackson on race-related issues, which suggests a dislike for the double standard and a support for fair consideration of minority candidates.	"Summary:
The text discusses the evolution of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's views on affirmative action and federalism, influenced in part by her relationship with Justice Thurgood Marshall. Initially, O'Connor was known for opposing affirmative action and favoring states' rights. However, by the time of her retirement in 2006, her perspective had shifted, and she authored the majority opinion upholding affirmative action in university admissions. The author suggests that while it's unlikely that Marshall's influence was the sole factor in O'Connor's changed views, it should not be dismissed.

The author then shifts to discuss President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, and the potential impact she could have on the court. The author highlights Jackson's background and achievements, noting that while her race is significant, it should not be the sole focus when considering the diversity she brings to the court. The author criticizes the expectation that Jackson should be grilled on her views on race, pointing out the double standard that white nominees are not subjected to the same scrutiny.

The author concludes by reflecting on Jackson's life story as an American success story, suggesting that her familiar path to the Supreme Court could inspire her colleagues to reconsider their perspectives. The author expresses hope that Jackson's presence on the court may change the conversation, even if she does not change the court itself.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, noting Justice O'Connor's eventual support for it and the significance of preserving it in university admissions. The author seems to appreciate the nuanced and evolving nature of individual perspectives on such policies, as evidenced by O'Connor's shift over time. Furthermore, the author implicitly supports the idea of diversity in the Supreme Court and seems to regard affirmative action as a valuable tool for achieving a more representative judiciary. The mention of Judge Jackson's potential to inspire change in the conversation around affirmative action and other issues suggests that the author believes in the importance of diverse voices in shaping legal discourse and policy."	0.05235	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author, David Bernstein, does not directly address his stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. Instead, he focuses on the broader issue of how race and racism are taught in schools, criticizing the lack of diverse perspectives and critical debate in the curriculum. His concern about the potential limitations on teaching various sides of the affirmative-action debate implies that he values a balanced and open discussion on the topic. Therefore, without a clear statement of his position on affirmative action, we can categorize him as 'neutral,' since he neither explicitly supports nor opposes affirmative action but advocates for an educational approach that includes multiple viewpoints.	"Summary:
David Bernstein argues that the current debate on how to teach race and racism in U.S. schools is too polarized, with the right pushing for bans on critical race theory (CRT) and the left advocating for a singular perspective on America's history of racism without room for debate. Bernstein, a parent with children in Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, criticizes a new proposed social-studies curriculum that he feels is prescriptive and closes off alternative interpretations or debate. He shares anecdotes about his son's experiences in school, where discussions on race are pervasive and one-sided, leaving no room for diverse opinions or critical thinking.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bernstein does not directly state his position on affirmative action in the text. However, he criticizes the vague wording of an executive order signed by the new Virginia governor aimed at ending the use of ""divisive concepts"" in schools, which he fears could limit teaching about various sides of the affirmative-action debate. Bernstein advocates for a balanced approach to education that includes multiple perspectives on American history and social issues, suggesting that students should be exposed to a range of scholarly opinions on racial disparities, including those related to systemic racism, class, and cultural factors. This suggests that while he does not explicitly endorse or oppose affirmative action, he supports open discussion and critical examination of such policies as part of a comprehensive education."	0.030080000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors express concern about the future of civil rights in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision, which includes affirmative action. Although affirmative action is not the primary focus of their discussion, the apprehension they show towards the potential rollback of civil rights suggests they are in favor of maintaining these protections, including affirmative action. Linda Linton's and Michael D. Abell's comments indicate a fear that affirmative action could be undermined, demonstrating a supportive stance towards it. However, without explicit statements endorsing affirmative action, it is difficult to determine if they are 'strongly' or 'somewhat' in favor. Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that they are at least 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action, as they seem to view it as part of the broader spectrum of civil rights that should be protected.	"Summary:
The text provided consists of opinions from various individuals reacting to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and its potential implications for other rights in the United States. Linda Linton expresses concern about the future of a secular nation and the potential erosion of rights for women, LGBTQ individuals, and the impact on affirmative action and states' rights. Michael D. Abell fears that the decision could lead to a rollback of civil rights, potentially undoing Brown v. Board of Education and leading to a new era of segregation. George Miller warns that Title IX could be at risk due to the court's rationale in overturning Roe v. Wade. Julie Thostenson takes a different stance, emphasizing personal responsibility in the context of pregnancy and body autonomy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors do not directly address affirmative action in detail, but there is an underlying concern about its future. Linda Linton's questions about affirmative action suggest a worry that the rights and protections it offers could be undermined by the same forces that led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Michael D. Abell's comments imply that the recent decision could set a precedent for states to dismantle various civil rights, which could include affirmative action. The general perspective is one of apprehension that affirmative action, along with other rights, could be threatened in the current judicial and political climate."	0.02613	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	Renu Mukherjee's critical view of affirmative action and advocacy for race-neutral admissions policies suggest that she believes the current system is flawed and does not achieve its intended goals of fostering diversity. Her call for alternatives to race-based affirmative action indicates that she is not in favor of the practice as it stands. Her perspective is not neutral, as she actively criticizes the policy and proposes different solutions, and it is not merely somewhat against, as her advocacy for a different approach implies a strong position against the current affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court is set to hear challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill, marking an ongoing debate since the court first ruled on such policies over 40 years ago. Despite affirmative action being banned in nine states and public opinion showing a majority against considering race in college admissions, the conversation around the practice remains complex and contentious. Justin Driver suggests a middle path that allows institutions to gradually shift to race-neutral admissions. Linda Greenhouse reflects on the evolving interpretation of Brown v. Board of Education, while Renu Mukherjee criticizes affirmative action for not recognizing the full spectrum of diversity, advocating for race-neutral alternatives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Renu Mukherjee, is critical of affirmative action policies, suggesting that they have not successfully advanced diversity on campus as intended. Mukherjee advocates for race-neutral admissions policies, which she believes can help achieve a more multifaceted diversity. She challenges the assumption that race-conscious admissions programs are the best or only way to foster diversity and uses her personal story to illustrate the potential for diverse perspectives that are not acknowledged under current affirmative action frameworks. Mukherjee's perspective is that there are better ways to make campuses diverse without relying on race-based affirmative action."	0.02769	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the text express concern about the Supreme Court potentially reversing a decision upholding affirmative action, which they view as a remedy for school segregation. This concern, coupled with their critical view of the Supreme Court's trend of limiting access to the courts and protecting civil rights under Chief Justice Roberts, suggests that the authors are in favor of affirmative action. They see it as a means to maintain gains won for various groups and as an important aspect of civil rights. Their perspective is not neutral or ambivalent but carries a critical tone towards actions that might diminish the effectiveness of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the 2022 year-end report by Chief Justice John Roberts, which is noted for its omissions rather than its content. The report highlights the threats faced by judges and the new law to protect their personal information, but it avoids discussing significant issues such as the lack of an effective recusal requirement for justices, the leak of a draft decision on abortion rights, and concerns about financial disclosure. The authors also point out a decline in the use of federal courts, with fewer filings at both the appellate and trial levels, and attribute this trend to the Supreme Court's decisions that have limited access to the courts, such as by enforcing arbitration clauses. They argue that Congress needs to act to ensure access to the courts, as it did with the amendment to the Federal Arbitration Act for sexual assault and harassment victims.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express concern that the Supreme Court appears poised to reverse a decision upholding affirmative action in school admissions, which was a remedy spawned by the Brown v. Board of Education decision to desegregate schools. They suggest that this potential reversal is part of a broader pattern in which the current Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, has shown little interest in opening doors to the courts or protecting civil rights. The authors imply that the Court's conservative majority may extinguish gains won for various groups, including those benefiting from affirmative action. The perspective presented is that the authors are critical of the Supreme Court's direction under Chief Justice Roberts, particularly with regard to its stance on affirmative action and access to justice."	0.03152	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, William McGurn, presents a perspective that is critical of affirmative action policies as implemented in the context of public education in Fairfax County, Virginia. He describes these policies as a 'war on achievement' and suggests they unfairly target high-achieving students, particularly Asian-Americans, in the pursuit of equity. McGurn views the changes in TJ's admissions policy, which aimed to increase representation of African-American and Hispanic students at the expense of Asian-American enrollment, as an example of affirmative action gone awry. He argues that these policies focus on equal outcomes rather than equal opportunities, and he sees them as a deviation from the meritocratic principles that should underpin the education system. McGurn's use of language such as 'war on achievement' and his concern over the reduced opportunities for Asian-American students due to these policies indicate a stance that is critical of affirmative action as it is being applied.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding several high schools in Northern Virginia, particularly Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (""TJ""), which failed to notify students of their recognition by the National Merit Scholarship Program. This issue has prompted a civil rights investigation by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares. The author suggests that these failures may not be mere bureaucratic errors but part of a broader equity agenda in public education that has become a ""war on achievement,"" particularly affecting Asian-American students. The author cites changes in TJ's admissions policy that aimed to increase African-American and Hispanic representation at the expense of Asian-American enrollment and mentions a consultant's definition of equity as ""equal outcomes for every student, without exception."" The author also highlights instances of perceived progressive disdain for Asian-American academic success and the broader conflict between school officials and parents over educational control.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William McGurn, appears to be critical of affirmative action policies, particularly as they are implemented in the context of public education in Fairfax County, Virginia. McGurn views these policies as a ""war on achievement,"" suggesting that they unfairly target high-achieving students, many of whom are Asian-American, in the name of equity. He points to the change in TJ's admissions policy, which was designed to increase the representation of African-American and Hispanic students, as an example of how these policies can reduce opportunities for Asian-American students. The author also suggests that the concept of equity, as defined by a consultant hired by the district, is problematic because it focuses on equal outcomes rather than equal opportunities. McGurn's perspective is that affirmative action, in this case, has devolved from a well-intentioned effort to prevent discrimination into a system that penalizes students for their achievements and undermines the meritocratic principles of the education system."	0.03243	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, Vivek Ramaswamy, expresses a clear opposition to affirmative action by advocating for its elimination and criticizing its effects on fairness and merit-based success. His stance is that affirmative action leads to race-based preferences that disadvantage certain groups and foster resentment, which is why he commits to rescinding relevant executive orders and prosecuting race-based preferences. This indicates a strong opposition to affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old political outsider and co-founder of Strive Asset Management, announces his presidential candidacy, aiming to create a new American Dream centered around the pursuit of excellence rather than solely on financial success. He criticizes Republicans for lacking a clear alternative to the ""woke agenda"" and proposes a cultural movement to redefine American identity. Ramaswamy advocates for a merit-based approach to immigration, the elimination of affirmative action, the empowerment of elected officials over bureaucrats, and the protection of free speech. He also emphasizes the need to assert economic independence from China and to re-establish American ideals as the unifying force of the nation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Vivek Ramaswamy, holds a critical view of affirmative action. He believes that affirmative action, specifically in the context of federal contractors due to Executive Order 11246, leads to race-based hiring preferences that result in unfairness and resentment. Ramaswamy argues that qualified applicants, particularly those who are white or Asian-American, are unfairly disadvantaged, which in turn fosters negative attitudes toward black and Hispanic hires. He commits to eliminating affirmative action across the American economy by rescinding the executive order and prosecuting illegal race-based preferences. His perspective is rooted in the belief that merit should be the sole criterion for success in America, and he sees affirmative action as antithetical to this principle."	0.02763	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author criticizes the Supreme Court for acting as a right-wing policymaker and implies that its decisions, including those on affirmative action, are driven by partisanship rather than impartial legal judgment. The text suggests that the author finds the Court's actions on affirmative action to be morally and politically offensive, and indicative of a disregard for established legal precedents. The author's perspective is that the Court's handling of affirmative action is part of a pattern of undermining democracy and self-government. This criticism indicates a stance that is against the Court's current approach to affirmative action, which the author believes is aligned with a right-wing agenda.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the current U.S. Supreme Court for acting outside of its judicial role and making policy decisions that overturn established laws and affect Americans' lives. It is argued that the Court has become a right-wing policymaker, disregarding legal doctrines and facts to reach desired outcomes. The author calls for exposing the Court's loss of legitimacy and taking action to preserve democracy, suggesting reforms such as term limits and court expansion. The Court's refusal to follow consistent rules, its creation of standing where none exists, and its use of the ""major questions doctrine"" to invalidate programs it disapproves of are highlighted as evidence of its partisanship. The author asserts that the public recognizes the Court's partisanship, and emphasizes the need for each election to serve as a referendum on the Court's legitimacy to ensure the survival of democracy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decisions on affirmative action as morally and politically offensive to many Americans, suggesting that the Court has cast aside legal precedents without proper justification. The perspective is that the Court's handling of affirmative action is part of a broader pattern of partisan decision-making that aligns with a right-wing agenda, undermining the principles of self-government and democracy. The text indicates that the author is critical of the Court's approach to affirmative action, perceiving it as an example of the justices imposing their own policy preferences rather than acting as impartial arbiters of the law."	0.03222	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern over the end of affirmative action and its potential negative impact on diversity within academia, indicating a belief in the policy's benefits for students of color and the creation of a diverse educational environment. The inclusion of a quote that conveys dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's decision suggests the author disagrees with the ruling and believes affirmative action is still necessary. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they acknowledge its past benefits and are concerned about the consequences of its removal, but they do not provide a strong advocacy for the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the implications of the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action in college admissions, particularly in the context of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on the job market. The author suggests that with AI taking over white-collar jobs, the value of a traditional college education may be diminishing. They argue that practical skills for jobs that cannot be automated, such as those involving outdoor or physical work, may become more important. The author also explores the emotional and creative aspects that AI lacks, which can still give human writers an edge. However, there's concern about the future of academia and the potential decrease in diversity due to the end of affirmative action, which might lead to a decline in college enrollment among young men and students of color.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a policy that has been beneficial for students of color, helping to create a more diverse academic environment. They express concern that ending affirmative action could lead to a decrease in college enrollment among Black and Brown students, which could have long-term negative effects on academia. The author seems to suggest that while the Supreme Court believes affirmative action is outdated and no longer necessary, there remains a need for such measures to ensure diversity and equal opportunity in higher education. The author conveys a sense of skepticism about the court's decision, as evidenced by their inclusion of a quote from Suzanne Szostak, who ironically wishes the Supreme Court were an AI chatbot, implying dissatisfaction with the ruling."	0.02964	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt	2
	None	The provided summary does not directly address the author's perspective on affirmative action. The focus is on a Supreme Court case related to LGBTQ+ rights and religious freedom. While there is a mention of the 'gutting of affirmative action,' it is not the central topic, and no clear stance is taken by the authors mentioned in the summary. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information provided.	"Summary:
The text comprises a series of opinions from different authors reacting to the Supreme Court's decision in the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis, where the court sided with a web designer who refused to provide services to same-sex couples. Michael D. Schattman humorously notes the absurdity of the case, as it involved a hypothetical scenario. Kathy Viney criticizes the use of religious freedom as a justification for discrimination. Ravin Bhatia expresses fear for the future of LGBTQ+ rights and is disheartened by the timing of the ruling during Pride Month. Aimée La Fountain is shocked by the misrepresentation involved in the case and suggests potential legal repercussions for the plaintiff. David Dorsen points out the complexity of the issue, suggesting that rights can have unintended consequences when applied in different contexts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, there is a mention of the Supreme Court's ""gutting of affirmative action"" as one of the controversial decisions made by the court, alongside the reduction of federal abortion protections. This reference suggests that the author or the person quoted may view affirmative action as a necessary policy to promote equality and may be critical of the Supreme Court's decision to weaken it. The concern is that the court's rulings are part of a trend that undermines the rights of minority groups, which could include the protections offered by affirmative action."	0.023200000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Ibert Schultz, is depicted as an advocate for affirmative action, given their role as the executive director of an organization that assists Black students in accessing higher education and their critical view of a ban on affirmative action. Schultz's emphasis on the challenges faced by Black students, the negative impact of Proposition 209 on Black student enrollment, and the belief that a colorblind admissions process is harmful all indicate strong support for affirmative action as a means to achieve equity in educational opportunities.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to ban affirmative action on college admissions, particularly emphasizing the challenges faced by Black students. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit that helps Black students in South Los Angeles access higher education. Schultz references California's experience with Proposition 209, which led to a significant decrease in Black student enrollment in state colleges and universities. Schultz highlights the difficulties Black students face, including low college enrollment and graduation rates, as well as economic challenges. Despite these obstacles, Black College Success has celebrated admissions successes, with students gaining entry to prestigious institutions and earning scholarships. Schultz outlines the organization's approach, which includes personalized support, academic planning, mentoring, and college application assistance. Schultz argues that a colorblind admissions process overlooks the unique experiences of Black applicants and ultimately harms both the individuals and society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ibert Schultz, views affirmative action as a necessary tool to help level the playing field for students who face systemic challenges and disadvantages, particularly Black students. Schultz sees the ban on affirmative action as a step backward, leading to a ""colorblind"" admissions process that fails to acknowledge and address the unique experiences and obstacles that Black students encounter. The author believes that without affirmative action, opportunities for these students may diminish, and the potential contributions they could make to society could be lost. Schultz’s perspective is that affirmative action is not merely about preferential treatment but about creating equitable access to education and recognizing the diverse backgrounds of all students."	0.0278	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated but can be inferred from the context. The text describes the efforts of UC Irvine to enhance diversity and establish a Diversity Council, which suggests a positive view of diversity initiatives. The mention of Ward Connerly's opposition serves as a contrast to the university's actions, implying that the author sees the value in UCI's commitment to diversity. The author acknowledges the need for better representation of women and minorities and reports on the community's support for dialogue among ethnic groups. While the author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action, the overall tone is one of recognizing and appreciating the importance of diversity efforts, which often align with the goals of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
UC Irvine, under the leadership of Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, has been engaged in an extensive process to address diversity within its academic community. The university is in the process of establishing a Diversity Council, a move that coincides with discussions on affirmative action, especially in light of UC Regent Ward Connerly's opposition to race-based preferences. A consultant indicated that while there is support for diversity both at the top and grassroots levels of UCI, the middle management requires more encouragement. The university has been active in promoting diversity both on and off-campus, with various programs and events, and notable involvement from UCI graduates in the community. Nonetheless, UCI recognizes the need to improve the representation of women and minorities in faculty positions. The importance of diversity is echoed by the Orange County community, with a survey indicating strong support for programs that increase dialogue among different ethnic groups.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action as a contentious issue that often intersects with discussions on diversity. While the author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, they highlight the activities and initiatives that UCI has taken to promote diversity, suggesting a positive view of efforts to enhance representation and understanding among various ethnic groups. The mention of Ward Connerly's opposition to affirmative action is used to contrast the ongoing diversity efforts at UCI, implying that the university values diversity as an asset and is actively working to improve it, despite the broader political challenges to race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. The author seems to appreciate the proactive steps taken by the university and the community's support for diversity, which may suggest that they view affirmative action or similar diversity-promoting measures as necessary and beneficial."	0.024419999999999997	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The mention of Colin Powell's moderate stance on affirmative action is used to characterize Powell's political position rather than to express the author's own views on the policy. Therefore, the author does not provide enough information on their own stance toward affirmative action, and it would be inaccurate to categorize the author's perspective based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the general lack of enthusiasm for the major-party candidates in the upcoming presidential election, with Bill Clinton and Republican contenders like Bob Dole and Phil Gramm not generating much excitement. The author attributes this apathy to a wider American disenchantment with the political process, including distrust of professional politicians and dissatisfaction with ideological extremes. The focus then shifts to Colin Powell, who is promoting his memoirs and thus entering the political spotlight. Powell, described as charismatic and a true American success story, has begun to express his moderate political views on various issues, including affirmative action. The author suggests that Powell's potential candidacy could be appealing to voters seeking an alternative to the traditional two-party offerings, despite the challenges of running without a major party's support.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions that Colin Powell supports some form of affirmative action, indicating a moderate stance on the issue. However, the text does not delve deeply into the author's personal perspective on affirmative action. Instead, the mention of Powell's position on affirmative action serves to situate him within the political landscape as a moderate who might not align perfectly with the more conservative elements of the Republican Party as of 1996. The author's focus is more on Powell's overall moderate positions and potential appeal to a disenchanted electorate rather than on a detailed analysis or critique of affirmative action policies."	0.02146	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author implies a positive view of affirmative action by equating opposition to it with regressive racism and a 'vigilante mood' that he finds disturbing. He contrasts this with the inclusive spirit of California, which he appreciates and sees as being threatened by anti-affirmative action sentiments. His mention of the Chicano movement and the impact of leaders and activists in California further suggests that he values efforts to promote equity and justice, which are typically goals of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the celebration of Cinco de Mayo in California, a holiday commemorating a Mexican military victory, which has become a commercialized spring fiesta in the U.S. The author, a Texan who has adopted California as home, contrasts his experiences of overt racism in Texas with the more subtle racism he encountered in California two decades ago. However, recent anti-immigration and anti-affirmative action sentiments in California remind him of the racism in Texas. He expresses a strong attachment to California despite these issues, citing the state's spiritual energy, innovative spirit, and his own nostalgic memories. He recalls the cultural impact of California on Texas during his youth and how the Chicano movement influenced his identity. The author acknowledges the contributions of various leaders and activists in California and concludes with a sense of belonging and pride in being Californian, celebrating Cinco de Mayo.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a positive force, and its opposition as a step backward, akin to the overt racism he experienced in Texas. He implies that anti-affirmative action sentiments contribute to a ""vigilante mood"" in California, which he finds regressive and at odds with the inclusive spirit of the state that he has grown to love. The author's perspective suggests that he sees affirmative action as an important tool for equity and justice, and its opposition as a threat to the progress that has been made in California."	0.02742	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is indicated by their support for Richard C. Atkinson, who is described as a supporter of affirmative action and who delayed implementing the UC Board of Regents' decision to end race and gender preferences. This delay suggests that the author disapproves of the decision to eliminate affirmative action, viewing it as a politically motivated action that negatively impacts the university's mission and its students. The author's concern for the potential to address systematic race bias and create a more equitable system for underprivileged students further reinforces their support for affirmative action. Although the author acknowledges the regents' constitutional authority, the overall tone criticizes the political interference and the subsequent negative consequences for the university.	"Summary:
In 1967, UC President Clark Kerr was fired by Governor Ronald Reagan for his perceived lenient approach to the Free Speech Movement, which caused outrage among faculty and students. Nearly three decades later, a similar controversy arose within the University of California (UC) system over affirmative action. The UC Board of Regents, influenced by Governor Pete Wilson's political agenda, voted to end race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring. This decision faced opposition from chancellors, student governments, and activists, leading to a call for non-compliance and protests.

Richard C. Atkinson, a supporter of affirmative action, became the new UC president amidst this turmoil. Tasked with implementing the regents' policy, he delayed its full implementation, which led to a confrontation with the regents who questioned his authority. Atkinson eventually apologized and agreed to expedite the policy change.

The author is concerned about the political interference in the university's governance and the impact of these conflicts on students and the university's mission to educate the next generation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action and criticizes the political motivations behind the UC Board of Regents' decision to eliminate race and gender preferences. The author suggests that the regents' actions were partly driven by Governor Wilson's presidential campaign and that the president of the UC system, Richard C. Atkinson, also made a political decision in delaying the implementation of the new policy. However, the author acknowledges that the regents have the constitutional authority to set policy for the university.

The author emphasizes the negative consequences of the political struggle on the university's ability to serve its students, particularly at a time when the regents had the chance to address systematic race bias and create a more equitable system for underprivileged students. The author calls for leadership that will guide the university forward rather than hinder its progress."	0.03219	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging both its potential benefits in terms of historical correction of injustices and its shortcomings, such as not addressing broader economic disparities and the possibility of benefiting the well-off within minority groups. The author does not outright reject affirmative action but calls for a more balanced and comprehensive debate to address the complexity of the issue. This perspective does not align with a strong stance for or against affirmative action but rather suggests a middle ground that seeks to improve the policy by considering all sides of the argument.	"Summary:
The text provides a critical analysis of affirmative action, arguing that it is a zero-sum game that redistributes existing opportunities rather than expanding them. It suggests that affirmative action does not address income disparities but rather focuses on the demographic representation in coveted positions. The author contrasts affirmative action with traditional redistributive programs, which are based on need rather than identity and can more easily be adjusted in terms of funding. Affirmative action is seen as problematic because it deals with finite opportunities and is based on fixed group identities. The author acknowledges that affirmative action can be seen as unjust, especially when it benefits the well-off within minority groups over disadvantaged individuals from majority groups. However, the text also recognizes the historical context of racial discrimination and the need for inclusion of African Americans in all societal levels. The author cites Nathan Glazer's concern that abolishing affirmative action could be perceived as a rejection by society. The text concludes by calling for a balanced debate on affirmative action, recognizing the complexity of achieving true equality of opportunity and the need to address concerns from all sides.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They acknowledge the shortcomings of affirmative action, such as its failure to address broader economic inequalities and the potential for it to benefit the already privileged within minority groups. The author also recognizes the historical injustices of race and gender and the need for societal inclusion. They suggest that both supporters and opponents of affirmative action should consider each other's valid points and that a more comprehensive approach to equality of opportunity is needed. The author seems to advocate for a more complex and inclusive debate on the issue, rather than a simplistic endorsement or rejection of affirmative action policies. The proposal for a commission to study affirmative action reflects a desire for a thoughtful, informed discussion that goes beyond moralistic judgments and considers practical solutions for achieving greater equality."	0.031310000000000004	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's stance on affirmative action is nuanced, acknowledging both the positive intentions and the potential negative consequences of such policies. The author appreciates the efforts of The Washington Post to create a diverse work environment but criticizes the focus on numerical goals or quotas. The author's call for 'absolute nondiscrimination' and emphasis on the quality of work rather than diversity percentages suggest a preference for a merit-based system without the imposition of quotas. While the author does not reject the concept of affirmative action outright, there is a clear concern about its implementation and the possible negative repercussions it can have on workplace dynamics and perceptions of minority capabilities.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of The Washington Post's affirmative action policies, sparked by an article written by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic. Shalit accused The Post of lowering its standards to meet affirmative action goals, causing ""racial strife"" within the organization. The Post's editor, Leonard Downie Jr., and publisher, Donald E. Graham, vehemently denied these accusations, asserting that their hiring standards and news coverage have not been compromised. The author acknowledges the complexity of affirmative action, noting the emotional impact of hiring goals on white males and the broader economic pressures that make such programs contentious. The author also recognizes the potential drawbacks of affirmative action for minorities, citing the discomfort of black journalists over the suggestion that some hires might be unqualified. The author expresses admiration for The Post's diversity efforts but argues that success should be measured by the quality of the newspaper produced rather than by meeting numerical goals, advocating for ""absolute nondiscrimination"" over quotas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. While recognizing the good intentions behind The Washington Post's efforts to diversify its staff and the importance of a diversified newsroom, the author is critical of the implementation of affirmative action policies that rely on numerical goals or quotas. The author suggests that such policies can create divisions and a sense of unfairness, particularly among white males who may feel disadvantaged by these goals. The author also notes the potential harm to minorities if affirmative action leads to perceptions of incompetence. Ultimately, the author calls for a focus on nondiscrimination and the quality of work produced rather than on meeting specific diversity percentages. The perspective is one of support for the principles of racial justice and diversity but with a critical eye on the methods used to achieve these ends."	0.02966	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Mr. Lynch, presents a critical view of affirmative action, emphasizing its negative consequences on white men and arguing that it leads to reverse discrimination. He shares anecdotal evidence and discusses the lack of open dialogue about the policy's drawbacks. Lynch's advocacy for the recognition of the negative impacts on white males and his warning against labeling critics as racists indicate a perspective that is critical of affirmative action's current implementation and the societal handling of its criticisms.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action on white men, suggesting that 1-in-10 white men has been negatively affected by such policies. The author, Mr. Lynch, argues that affirmative action has often resulted in reverse discrimination, particularly in competitive job markets and public sectors, and has been most pronounced for white men under 45 with people-oriented skills. He shares anecdotal evidence and results from interviews with white men who believe they have lost job opportunities or career advancement due to affirmative action. The text also critiques the political and social responses to these grievances, highlighting a lack of open dialogue and the suppression of research findings that indicate white discontent with affirmative action. The author advocates for the recognition of the negative consequences of affirmative action on white males as a legitimate issue and warns against automatically labeling criticism of affirmative action as racism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Lynch, views affirmative action as a well-intentioned but flawed policy that has led to reverse discrimination against white men. He believes that affirmative action has been implemented in a manner that has created a ""racial spoils system"" with significant negative consequences for certain demographic groups, particularly white males in the public sector and in competitive job markets. Lynch argues that the grievances of white men affected by affirmative action have been largely dismissed or suppressed by both liberals and conservatives, preventing an open and honest discussion about the policy's shortcomings. He suggests that acknowledging these issues is crucial for understanding the full impact of affirmative action and for preventing the emotional exploitation of the topic. Lynch's perspective is critical of the policy's execution and the societal and political unwillingness to address the concerns of those who feel victimized by it."	0.03807	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action. This is indicated by the criticism of traditional civil rights leadership's focus on social engineering and racial quotas, which the author believes do not align with the priorities of many black Americans. The author cites survey data showing that a majority of black Americans prefer ability over race as the determining factor in hiring and education decisions. Furthermore, the author advocates for empowerment and opportunity-based approaches rather than the redistribution of opportunities through what is described as a racial spoils system. The text also highlights a disconnect between the views of black leaders and the general black population on affirmative action, suggesting that the author believes affirmative action policies are not representative of or beneficial to the broader black community.	"Summary:
The text discusses the racial polarization in America and challenges the notion that black and white Americans have fundamentally different views and aspirations. It cites a survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies which shows that a majority of black Americans share common American aspirations like safe streets, good schools, and home ownership. The survey also reveals that mainstream black Americans are more conservative than the politicians and organizations that claim to represent them, with a significant number identifying as conservative, especially among the youth. However, few black conservatives align with the Republican Party due to perceived neglect or hostility from the GOP.

The author argues that there is a disconnect between the priorities of black Americans and the traditional civil rights leadership, which tends to focus on social engineering and racial quotas. Many black Americans prioritize issues like education, crime, and economic opportunity. The text suggests that conservative groups have an opportunity to build coalitions with black communities on issues like school choice and economic empowerment.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, particularly the way it is supported by the established civil rights leadership. He cites another survey that shows a stark contrast between the views of black leaders and the general black population on affirmative action, with a majority of black Americans preferring ability over race as the determining factor in hiring and education decisions. The author believes that affirmative action and similar social engineering strategies are out of touch with the real problems facing many black Americans and have little relevance to them, suggesting that empowerment and opportunity-based approaches would be more effective. The author also criticizes politicians, including President George Bush and Bill Clinton, for not presenting a clear and appealing agenda to black Americans that focuses on tangible opportunities for upward mobility. The text concludes by emphasizing the need to empower those denied opportunities rather than redistributing opportunities through a racial spoils system, invoking the ideals of equality and opportunity that resonate with both blacks and whites in America."	0.036180000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action policies that involve quotas and their emphasis on a colorblind Constitution indicate a stance that is against race-conscious remedies typically associated with affirmative action. The author's alignment with Clarence Thomas's belief in individual liberty, equal treatment of individuals without regard to race, and a 'plain reading' of the Constitution further supports the categorization of their stance as being against affirmative action, particularly against policies that involve quotas.	"Summary:
The NAACP is considering whether to oppose the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, with a preference for a nominee more like Thurgood Marshall. However, the article argues that Thomas and Marshall share similar views on equality and the Constitution, particularly regarding the Brown v. Board of Education case. Both believed the ruling should have been based on constitutional text and the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of equality, rather than sociological studies. The author suggests that Thomas's approach to civil rights, like Marshall's, is grounded in a colorblind Constitution and natural rights, aiming for a ""plain reading"" of the Constitution that focuses on individual liberty and opposes quotas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action policies that involve quotas and race-conscious remedies. They highlight Clarence Thomas's opposition to such measures, emphasizing his belief in a colorblind Constitution and the importance of treating individuals equally without regard to race. The author commends Thomas's focus on original intent jurisprudence and his use of natural rights to seek a more enduring guarantee of equality. The author's perspective suggests a preference for individual merit and non-discriminatory practices over affirmative action policies that mandate quotas or give preferential treatment based on race."	0.02529	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of quotas and the perception of unfairness in university admissions suggests a dissatisfaction with the current state of affirmative action. The mention of support for reform efforts, such as the California Civil Rights Initiative, indicates a desire to move away from race-based preferences and a preference for assistance to underrepresented groups that does not involve quotas. The author's perspective seems to align with a merit-based approach and a reformation of affirmative action rather than its complete abolition, suggesting that the author is somewhat against the current implementation of affirmative action but not against the concept of leveling the playing field itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political and legal efforts in California to reform affirmative action, particularly in the context of the University of California system. Ward Connerly, a black University of California regent and friend of Governor Pete Wilson, has been vocal in his opposition to admissions quotas and race-based admissions, advocating for alternatives that focus on marketing the university to underrepresented groups and assisting them in application preparation. There is tension between those who support the current preference policies and those who feel that merit is being overlooked, particularly among white and Asian-heritage students. Legislative attempts to mandate university admissions that reflect the state's ethnic distribution have been vetoed, but new bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring, and contracting are expected to receive more attention. A significant development is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw quotas, which is set for the 1996 ballot and faces both support and opposition.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the current implementation of affirmative action, particularly the use of quotas and institutional mandates that they believe have led to bitterness and a perception of unfairness in university admissions. The author suggests that affirmative action has strayed from its original purpose, which was to level the playing field at the point of competition, and should be refocused on individual achievement. The author views the California Civil Rights Initiative and other reform efforts as a means to restore affirmative action's original intent and address the divisive effects of current policies. The text implies support for reforming affirmative action to eliminate preferences based on race or sex, and to instead provide assistance to underrepresented groups without using quotas."	0.0277	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's summary does not directly state their personal stance on affirmative action, focusing instead on Governor William Weld's position and the reaction of his political base. The text describes Weld's support for affirmative action and his dismissal of the concerns of white males, suggesting that Weld sees affirmative action as a necessary policy despite its imperfections. The author does not provide their own perspective on the policy but rather discusses the political implications of Weld's stance and how it has affected his support among certain voter groups. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
William Weld, who succeeded Michael Dukakis as Massachusetts governor in 1990, initially gained popularity by blending fiscal conservatism with social libertarianism. His recent actions, however, have alienated many of his supporters, particularly conservative Democrats known as ""Weldocrats."" Controversies surrounding Weld include approving a pay raise for state legislators, supporting costly off-duty police details for road work, and failing to enact promised reforms. Weld's credibility has been further eroded by his lack of enthusiasm for populist politics and ideological leadership. Despite his friendship with Newt Gingrich, Weld has shown little interest in party-building. His support for affirmative action has particularly disappointed his base, as he has dismissed the concerns of white males affected by the policy and emphasized the need to support minorities who face higher unemployment rates.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Weld's perspective on affirmative action as a shift from his previously more conservative stance to a more liberal one, which has surprised and disillusioned his supporters. Weld argues for the necessity of affirmative action, likening it to systems like taxation or defense procurement that may have individual issues but serve a broader, necessary purpose. He dismisses the resentment expressed by white males as ""phony assertions"" and underscores the high unemployment rate among blacks as a ""crushing rationale"" for the policy. Weld's endorsement of affirmative action at a Northeastern University graduation ceremony is portrayed as a significant betrayal to his core supporters, who expected him to align with their values and address their concerns. The author suggests that this shift has contributed to a broader warning about the integrity of ""new-age fusion Republicanism,"" indicating a skepticism about politicians who change their positions after election."	0.03573	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as somewhat against it, as they argue for economic measures that could reduce the need for affirmative action by stimulating growth in black businesses and creating jobs. This suggests that the author believes in other means of achieving racial equality and economic empowerment for the black community, potentially viewing affirmative action as a less effective or less desirable solution.	"Summary:
The text argues that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) should support a reduction in capital gains taxes. The author believes this would stimulate economic growth by freeing up capital for new investments, particularly in black-controlled companies, which could create jobs for middle- and working-class people, including those in the constituencies of CBC members. The text suggests that increased venture capital investment in black businesses could create jobs and reduce the need for welfare and affirmative action. The author also proposes other government measures to support black-owned businesses, such as encouraging pension funds to invest in them and urging brokerage firms to raise capital for them. The author concludes that a capital gains tax cut would not only help black businesses and their predominantly black workforces but also allow the CBC to form a strategic alliance with the Republican Congress and showcase its members as effective leaders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to hold a critical view of affirmative action, suggesting that economic policies that increase investment in black businesses could eventually ""completely eliminate the need for affirmative action."" This indicates a belief that economic empowerment through business growth and job creation is a more sustainable and effective means of achieving racial equality and providing opportunities to the black community than affirmative action policies. The author's perspective is that affirmative action could be rendered unnecessary if black businesses are given the capital to succeed and expand, thus naturally creating opportunities for black Americans."	0.02356	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's use of the term 'quota-mongering' and the critical tone regarding the Democratic Party's approach to affirmative action suggest a negative view of affirmative action policies, particularly those that involve quotas or specific targets. The author's focus on the need for 'exceptional judgment and sensitivity' in the Labor Secretary position indicates a belief that current practices may not be fair or effective, and the mention of the 'mend it, don't end it' approach suggests skepticism about the administration's commitment to reform. The author's perspective does not outright reject affirmative action but rather criticizes its current implementation and the political motivations behind it, indicating a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action as it is being practiced.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman for the position of Labor Secretary. It questions her suitability for the role, given her involvement in the White House during a period of controversy over campaign contributions. The text also presents evidence of what the author considers ""quota-mongering"" by Herman, referencing a chart from a memo titled ""Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996."" The author argues that the Democratic Party is overly influenced by its constituent factions, which may conflict with moderate public statements. The text suggests that the Labor Department, particularly through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, has significant influence over affirmative action practices in corporations, and therefore requires a Labor Secretary with exceptional judgment and sensitivity, qualities the author implies Herman lacks.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, particularly as it is implemented through quotas or specific targets for representation. The term ""quota-mongering"" implies a negative view of the practice, suggesting that it is used in a manipulative or excessive way. The reference to the Democratic Party's internal political arrangements and the influence of various factions indicates the author's concern that affirmative action policies might be driven more by political pressures than by considerations of fairness or effectiveness. The mention of the ""mend it, don't end it"" approach to affirmative action implies skepticism about the sincerity of the Clinton administration's commitment to reforming these practices. Overall, the author's perspective seems to be that affirmative action, as practiced by the Democrats and potentially by Herman as Labor Secretary, is problematic and requires careful scrutiny and possible reform."	0.02554	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of affirmative action, as evidenced by the discussion of the California Civil Rights Initiative and the case of Astroline Communications, indicates a skepticism towards current affirmative action policies, particularly those involving quotas and set-asides. The mention of support for the CCRI from a significant portion of the black population and the Supreme Court's shift towards a color-blind policy suggest that the author believes there is a valid critique of affirmative action within minority communities as well. The call for 'useful distinctions' signals a desire for a more nuanced debate rather than an outright dismissal of affirmative action, which suggests that while the author may not be completely against affirmative action in principle, they are critical of its current implementation.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the binary approach to political and social issues, where nuances are often ignored in favor of an ""all or nothing"" mentality. The California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) and its nationwide extension through the American Civil Rights Institute are highlighted as examples of efforts to question government-sponsored quotas and set-asides, particularly in affirmative action policies. Despite the opposition, CCRI passed with support from a significant portion of the black population. The text also examines the case of Astroline Communications Company, which benefited from the FCC's minority distress sale policy but was later revealed to have questionable minority ownership stakes. The Supreme Court's shift towards a color-blind policy in Adarand Constructors v. Pena is mentioned, which created barriers to government set-aside programs. The author suggests that a more nuanced approach, or ""useful distinctions,"" is needed in public discourse, especially as cases like Astroline's and allegations of racism in companies like Texaco undermine the credibility of affirmative action policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, particularly when it comes to set-aside programs that may be exploited or do not operate as intended. The author points to the case of Astroline Communications as an example where the minority ownership appeared to be nominal and not substantive, undermining the policy's goals. Furthermore, the author suggests that the proponents of affirmative action are often unwilling to engage in a nuanced discussion about its status and effectiveness, labeling critics as unforgivable sinners. The text implies that affirmative action, as it is being implemented, may not be serving its intended purpose and that a more nuanced, ""useful distinction"" approach is necessary to evaluate and possibly reform these policies. The author seems to advocate for a more transparent and credible system that can withstand public scrutiny and adapt based on new information and changing societal contexts."	0.02964	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action. The text acknowledges the complexities and controversies of affirmative action, including the perception of quotas and rigid preferences, but also recognizes public support for measures that ensure equal opportunity. It highlights successful affirmative action policies, such as those at West Point, and presents a balanced view by citing General Colin Powell's perspective on the need for temporary measures to correct past discrimination. The author's call for a more measured discourse and recognition of the commendable efforts of President Clinton's initiative further suggest a stance that is supportive, albeit with an understanding of the nuances and the need for careful implementation.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges and controversies surrounding President Clinton's initiative on race, which aims to address racial issues in America. The initiative has experienced setbacks, including criticism of the political acumen of John Hope Franklin, the head of the National Advisory Committee on Race, and a racial dialogue that excluded whites. President Clinton's town meeting in Akron was criticized for being unfocused, and there was controversy over his statement about Colin Powell's promotion in the Army being due to affirmative action. Despite these issues, the initiative is seen as a commendable effort to tackle the complex problem of race in America. The White House is taking more control over the initiative and planning new proposals, particularly targeting youth. The initiative is also attempting to include more conservative voices in the discussion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging the deep divisions in American opinion on the subject. While recognizing that affirmative action can be controversial when perceived as quotas or rigid preferences, the author also notes the public's support for measures that ensure equal opportunity. The text cites the mixed results of affirmative action votes in California and Houston as indicative of the nation's split stance. The author emphasizes that institutions like the U.S. Military Academy at West Point have implemented successful affirmative action policies, suggesting that these measures can be constructive when they aim to level the playing field. The author also mentions the cautious approach of some conservative African-Americans towards dismantling existing programs. The text highlights General Colin Powell's balanced view on affirmative action, which acknowledges the need for temporary measures to address past discrimination while also recognizing the potential drawbacks of preferential treatment. The author argues for a more measured discourse on affirmative action, moving away from inflammatory rhetoric, and suggests that if President Clinton's initiative can facilitate this, it would be a significant achievement."	0.03318	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of the media's rush to judgment on the Texaco tapes and the implication that affirmative action can lead to organizational tension suggest a skeptical stance towards affirmative action. The mention of merit-based advancement at historically black colleges and the negative view of quota-based systems imply a preference for merit over racial preferences. Additionally, the reference to California voters rejecting racial preferences supports the notion that the author has reservations about affirmative action policies that may not align with merit-based principles.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the controversy surrounding Texaco and allegations of racism based on the ""Texaco tapes,"" which were initially reported to contain racist language, including the use of the ""n"" word. The media had characterized the term ""black jelly bean"" as racist, but after Texaco enhanced the audio quality of the tapes, it was revealed that the word in question was ""Nicholas"" and that ""jelly bean"" was a metaphor for diversity within the company. The author criticizes the media for their rush to judgment and lack of depth in reporting, and points out that the real content of the tapes showed Texaco grappling with the challenges of downsizing while also trying to increase diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to have a skeptical view of affirmative action, suggesting that it can lead to tension within organizations, as evidenced by Texaco's situation where they were downsizing while simultaneously being pushed to increase minority and female representation. The author mentions a character who suggests recruiting at historically black colleges and universities where students advance on merit, implying that other MBA programs might promote by quota, which the author seems to view negatively. The author also references California voters rejecting racial preferences despite supporting Bill Clinton, indicating a belief that racial preferences might not be the right solution. The overall tone suggests that the author believes in merit-based advancement and has reservations about affirmative action policies that may lead to quotas or forced diversity measures."	0.03136	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's primary focus is on the ABA's involvement in non-legal issues and its anti-business stance, particularly in tort reform. Affirmative action is mentioned as one of several issues the ABA supports, which the author criticizes. However, because the text does not provide a detailed discussion of affirmative action and the author's specific views on it, we cannot conclusively determine the author's stance on affirmative action based solely on its inclusion in a list of activities the author disapproves of the ABA being involved in. Thus, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clear from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for its involvement in various non-legal issues, such as supporting abortion rights, endorsing affirmative action, and calling for a death penalty moratorium. It outlines the ABA's anti-business stance, particularly in the realm of tort reform, where the ABA has opposed measures that would limit litigation or reduce damages. The ABA is also criticized for its support of government mandates on businesses and for its lobbying efforts against civil justice reform. The author questions the ABA's impartiality and its ability to fulfill its quasi-governmental roles given its support of the plaintiffs' bar. The text also highlights the ABA's refusal to limit contingency fees and accuses it of selective evidence use to deny an increase in personal injury suits.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned as one of the non-legal matters the ABA endorses, which the author seems to view negatively. The inclusion of affirmative action in a list of issues that the author believes the ABA should not be involved in suggests that the author may be critical of the ABA's position on affirmative action. However, the main focus of the text is on the ABA's perceived anti-business agenda and its stance on tort reform rather than its views on affirmative action."	0.02699	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's personal stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the author's critique of media bias and the representation of liberal views as the norm, using affirmative action as an example of an issue where conservative viewpoints may not be given equal weight. Based on the summary, the author's perspective on affirmative action is only discussed in the context of media representation, not as a direct expression of their own views on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perception of liberal bias in the American media, particularly in the evening newscasts of the ""big-three"" networks, as seen by the author. It highlights the denials of liberal bias by prominent newscasters like Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings, and presents an argument that these media figures are either unaware of their own biases or are in denial about them. The author, Mr. Goldberg, suggests that the bias is not just about being harder on Republicans than Democrats, but rather about a worldview that sees liberal perspectives as the norm. He criticizes the media for labeling conservative figures and ideas while presenting liberal ones without such labels, implying that liberal views are the default or ""reasonable"" views. Goldberg also highlights the media's tendency to uncritically pass along liberal activist views and their lack of exposure to conservative perspectives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Goldberg, does not explicitly state his personal views on affirmative action within the provided text. However, he uses affirmative action as an example to illustrate what he perceives as the media's liberal bias. He suggests that the media elites treat liberal views on big social issues, such as affirmative action, as if they are not liberal but simply reasonable, implying that conservative views on such topics are not given the same neutral treatment. This perspective indicates that the author believes affirmative action is one of the issues where the media fails to provide balanced coverage and does not adequately represent opposing viewpoints, which in this context would be those critical of affirmative action."	0.029579999999999995	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is nuanced, recognizing both the historical necessity of such measures and the complexities involved in their implementation. While the author defends Coca-Cola against accusations of racism and notes the challenges companies face in navigating diversity management, they also acknowledge the importance of informal networks for minority employees and the problems associated with tokenism. The author does not express outright support or opposition to affirmative action but instead suggests a thoughtful consideration of its benefits and limitations. This indicates a perspective that is neither fully endorsing nor rejecting affirmative action but rather one that is critically engaged with its outcomes and implications.	"Summary:
The text discusses the circumstances surrounding a racial bias lawsuit against Coca-Cola, criticizing the media's portrayal of the company and its historical figures. It highlights how Coke's public relations struggles and a previous incident with Texaco have led to a more critical and less cautious media environment. The author challenges the accusations of racism against Coke's historical CEO, Robert S. Woodruff, and defends the company's efforts to integrate its sales force, arguing that independent bottlers' racism should not reflect on Coke. The text also mentions the problematic handling of a Texaco case by lawyer Cyrus Mehri and the media, and it suggests that affirmative action and diversity management are complex issues that corporations are still learning to navigate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging its historical necessity and the ongoing challenges it presents. The text suggests that affirmative action has led to ""clustering"" where minorities are often placed in visible roles within companies, which has become a subject of academic study. The author references Harvard's Rosabeth Kanter's work on the experiences of individuals who are the first of their kind in a department, noting the benefits of informal networks for minority employees. The text also points out the limitations of affirmative action, such as the ""social trap"" that can arise from tokenism and stigmatization. Overall, the author seems to believe in the importance of diversity management and the need for companies to learn how to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others, indicating a belief in the value of affirmative action while also recognizing its complexities and potential pitfalls."	0.03124	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author does not focus on affirmative action as a primary topic within the text, and it is only mentioned in passing. The reference to affirmative action is framed negatively, but it is not the central theme of the author's argument. The author's main concern appears to be government responses to terrorism and the potential consequences of negotiating with violent groups. Since affirmative action is not the focal point of the discussion and the author's stance on it is not thoroughly explored, it is challenging to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action definitively. The brief negative reference may suggest a critical view, but without more context or explicit commentary on affirmative action policies, it is not sufficient to determine a strong stance.	"Summary:
The text is a speculative political thriller plot set in an alternate reality where a fictional group named the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) seeks to return Texas to Mexican control through a violent campaign. Despite their actions, including bombings and assassinations, the American public is depicted as apathetic. A fictional U.S. President, Bartlet, engages in peace negotiations that lead to controversial concessions, such as releasing HRA prisoners, allowing HRA members into Texas state government, and weakening the state's police force. The author compares this scenario to the British government's handling of the situation in Northern Ireland, suggesting that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is making similar concessions to terrorists for the sake of expediency and peace, despite the potential long-term consequences for democratic principles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text. However, the author makes a brief reference to affirmative action in a negative light, suggesting that while most hard-working Latinos in Texas do not support the HRA, they are not opposed to the benefits that come from affirmative action policies implemented in response to the unrest. This could imply a critical view of affirmative action as something that is tolerated or accepted by the population, not because of its inherent value, but because it is seen as a benefit arising from undesirable circumstances. It's important to note that the main focus of the author's critique seems to be directed at perceived governmental weakness in the face of terrorism and the implications of compromising with violent groups, rather than a comprehensive analysis of affirmative action policy itself."	0.03387	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author provides an account of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's political campaign and her stance on affirmative action without explicitly endorsing or opposing affirmative action themselves. The summary focuses on how Townsend's position on affirmative action is received by the public and the potential impact on her campaign, rather than the author's personal views. The mention of a Democratic consultant's comment on the potential alienation of white voters suggests the author is aware of the divisive nature of affirmative action but does not provide enough information to categorize the author's stance on the matter.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political situation surrounding Maryland's gubernatorial race, focusing on Democratic candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. Two years prior, Townsend might have had the opportunity to become Al Gore's running mate, which could have led to a different outcome in the 2000 presidential election. Instead, she is running for governor against Republican Robert Ehrlich in a tight race. Townsend's campaign has been criticized for various missteps, including her choice of a white former Republican as her running mate, which upset some black leaders. Ehrlich, on the other hand, chose a black man, Michael Steele. Townsend has been accused of running a negative campaign, and her efforts to link Ehrlich to extremist views have been questioned. The race has also been influenced by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area, with Townsend's stance on gun control becoming a focal point. The author suggests that the outcome of the election could be affected by the ongoing sniper situation and voter turnout.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a scene where Townsend criticizes Ehrlich's opposition to affirmative action during a debate at Morgan State University. Townsend argues that affirmative action should be based on race, citing historical injustices such as slavery, lynching, discrimination, and Jim Crow laws. The author does not explicitly state his personal perspective on affirmative action but indicates that Townsend's approach to the issue may not resonate with all voters, as evidenced by the mixed reactions during the debate. The Democratic consultant's comment suggests that while Townsend's stance was supported within the debate hall, it may have alienated some white voters watching on TV. This implies that the author recognizes the complexity of the issue and the divisive nature of affirmative action as a political topic."	0.032659999999999995	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text critiques the political strategies employed by certain groups to influence judicial nominations and decisions, with affirmative action being mentioned in the context of these strategies. The author's negative view of the tactics used to affect the outcome of an affirmative action case suggests a critical stance on the politicization of the issue. However, there is insufficient information to determine the author's stance on affirmative action itself, as the text does not provide a direct evaluation of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses a situation where a young man, a Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is at risk of losing his job due to a leak of Democratic strategy memos. These memos, which were published by the Wall Street Journal, reveal the influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic senators concerning judicial nominations. The author criticizes the mainstream media for not covering the content of the memos and accuses them of diverting attention from the substance to the leak itself. The memos highlight political strategies, such as delaying judicial nominations to affect the outcome of cases, as seen with the Sixth Circuit's consideration of an affirmative action case. The author also mentions the investigation into the leak, led by Senator Orrin Hatch, which involved interviewing staff and reviewing computer files. The text concludes by questioning the treatment of the accused staffer and the lack of coverage on the broader implications of the memos.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context in which it is mentioned. The text refers to a specific instance where Democrats were advised to delay judicial nominees to the Sixth Circuit to ensure the court would uphold an affirmative action program in a case involving the University of Michigan. The author presents this as an example of political maneuvering rather than principled decision-making, suggesting a critical view of the use of affirmative action as a tool in judicial politics. The author's focus is on the politicization of the judiciary and the influence of special-interest groups, rather than on the merits or demerits of affirmative action policies themselves. However, the negative portrayal of the tactics used to influence the court's decision on an affirmative action case suggests that the author may view such strategies, and potentially affirmative action by extension, in a negative light."	0.03213	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's primary focus is on the political influence and legacy of the Daley family in Chicago, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. The mention of affirmative action is only in passing and is used to illustrate a point about political scandals, rather than to express a clear stance on the policy itself. Therefore, based on the provided summary, the author does not show a discernible position on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the enduring political power of the Daley family in Chicago, with Richard J. Daley serving as mayor from 1955 to 1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley, holding the office since 1989. The author mentions the possibility of Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. challenging the Daley dynasty but doubts any contender could win against Daley in the upcoming election. The author reflects on the transformation of Chicago under the Daley administration, with improvements in neighborhoods, the addition of green spaces, and the reduction of racial tensions. Despite the history of corruption in Chicago politics, the author suggests that the Daleys are not motivated by personal wealth but by the power to govern, and credits them with significant positive changes in the city. The author concludes that the Daleys' focus on Chicago, rather than higher political aspirations, contributes to their success and longevity in office.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly touches on the topic of affirmative action in the context of criticizing Chicago politics, mentioning a scandal involving affirmative-action contracts. However, the author does not delve deeply into the topic or provide a clear personal stance on affirmative action itself. Instead, the mention of affirmative action serves to highlight the ongoing political issues and scandals in Chicago under the Daley administration. The author's primary focus is on the Daley family's political power and the city's development rather than on a detailed examination of affirmative action policies."	0.029679999999999998	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Peter Berkowitz, is against affirmative action for conservative scholars in academia, suggesting that hiring should be based on competence to teach conservative ideas rather than political orientation. He argues for a balanced education that includes conservative thought, but without using affirmative action as a means to achieve this balance. Berkowitz's stance indicates that he values the quality of education and the representation of diverse ideas without resorting to identity-based hiring practices.	"Summary:
Peter Berkowitz criticizes elite universities for omitting conservative ideas from their political science curriculum. He argues that this exclusion is unjustifiable and undermines a liberal education and an objective study of political science. Berkowitz points out that conservative ideas are relevant in all subfields of political science, particularly American politics and political theory, but are rarely taught. He notes that while there is extensive coverage of various liberal and progressive theories, there is a significant gap when it comes to teaching about conservative thinkers and the tradition that includes figures like John Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan. Berkowitz insists that political science students receive an incomplete education without exposure to conservative ideas and that courses on this tradition should be mandatory. He opposes affirmative action for conservative scholars but advocates for hiring competent scholars who can teach conservatism to ensure a balanced and comprehensive education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Peter Berkowitz is against affirmative action for conservatives in academia. He believes that political science departments should not specifically seek out professors with conservative political opinions or lower scholarly standards to increase conservative representation. Berkowitz argues that one's identity should not be considered more important than knowledge and critical thinking when it comes to studying and teaching political ideas. He maintains that a scholar's political orientation should not determine their ability to study and teach conservative ideas and that it would be beneficial if scholars with progressive views engaged with conservative thought. Berkowitz suggests that hiring competent scholars to teach conservative ideas might inadvertently increase the number of conservative faculty members, but this should not be the goal. Instead, the aim should be to enrich the curriculum and educate students thoroughly, irrespective of the instructors' personal political affiliations."	0.0297	affirmative action	txt/399053714.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author acknowledges the validity of Jesse Helms's criticisms of affirmative action, indicating a level of agreement with Helms's viewpoint. However, the author also points out Helms's failure to address the broader context of racial issues, suggesting that the author recognizes the complexities surrounding affirmative action. The author's acknowledgment of 'valid points' against affirmative action, coupled with the critique of Helms's approach, places the author in a position of nuanced agreement, but with reservations about the lack of a more comprehensive solution to racial problems.	"Summary:
Jesse Helms, a conservative icon, passed away at the age of 86. He was a U.S. Senator known for his staunch social conservatism, anti-Communism, and opposition to union power and State Department foreign policy. Helms was a divisive figure, criticized for his racial views and comments on gays, but he also made efforts to modify his image later in life. He played a pivotal role in Ronald Reagan's political career by helping him win the North Carolina primary, which led to Reagan's continued challenge for the GOP nomination. Helms was known for his principled stand on issues, often blocking appointments and raising awareness about UN corruption. Despite his controversies, he did change his views, notably on Israel and AIDS funding in Africa, influenced by a visit to Israel and a friendship with Bono. Liberals, while critical of Helms, adopted some of his campaign techniques and media strategies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that Jesse Helms's criticisms of affirmative action were ""on the mark,"" suggesting that Helms had valid points against the policy. However, the author also notes that Helms failed to pair his criticism of government overreach with a call for social and moral transformation in the South and a clear denunciation of racism. This implies that while Helms had legitimate concerns about affirmative action, his approach lacked a comprehensive understanding of the racial dynamics and the need for broader social change. The author seems to suggest that Helms's perspective on affirmative action was correct in principle but incomplete in addressing the full scope of racial issues."	0.03046	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text, Mr. Riley, appears to be critical of affirmative action and similar policies. He references Thomas Sowell, who argues that political activity is not a key factor in the economic rise of minority groups, and suggests that economic gains often precede political gains. Riley is skeptical of the impact of political success on socioeconomic progress and criticizes policies supported by Obama that he believes could hinder economic opportunities. His perspective aligns with the idea that economic self-reliance and skill development are more effective for minority advancement than political success or affirmative action legislation.	"Summary:
The text explores the potential implications of Barack Obama's presidency for African-American progress, considering the historical debate between economic independence and integration into mainstream institutions. It references the differing views of W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington and notes the increase in black elected officials since the 1970s. However, it suggests that civil rights laws may not be solely responsible for black progress, citing lower unemployment rates for blacks before the 1960s and the work of economist Thomas Sowell, who argues that political activity is not a key factor in the economic rise of minority groups. The text also discusses examples of other ethnic groups that have achieved economic success before political success and warns that political success without economic progress can slow socioeconomic advancement, using the Irish in America as an example. The author expresses skepticism about Obama's potential impact on black upward mobility and criticizes his support for minimum wage laws and opposition to educational choice, suggesting these policies could hinder economic opportunities for young, less educated workers and poor blacks.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Riley, appears to be critical of affirmative action and similar policies. He references the work of Thomas Sowell, who has written extensively on the subject and argues that political activity and success are not necessary for the economic advancement of racial and ethnic groups. Riley suggests that historical examples support the view that economic gains often precede political gains and that political success does not guarantee socioeconomic progress. He expresses concern that Obama's policies, which he describes as ""liberal leanings,"" may maintain current obstacles to black progress rather than remove them. The author's perspective seems to align with the idea that economic self-reliance and skill development are more effective strategies for minority advancement than reliance on political success or affirmative action legislation."	0.031039999999999998	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, appears to be critical of the application of affirmative action policies in the case of Keith Sampson. Her criticism focuses on the perceived overreach and hypersensitivity of affirmative action officers at IUPUI, who accused Sampson of racial harassment for reading a historical book. Rabinowitz's perspective suggests that affirmative action, in this instance, led to an unjust accusation and a lack of common sense in distinguishing between scholarly work and actual racist propaganda. Although the text does not provide a broad critique of affirmative action as a whole, the author's disapproval of its implementation in this case indicates a stance that is somewhat against the way affirmative action was exercised by the university officials.	"Summary:
The text discusses an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) involving a student employee named Keith Sampson, who was accused of racial harassment for reading a book about the Ku Klux Klan during his work breaks. The book was a historical account of the fight against the Klan by Notre Dame students in the 1920s. Despite its scholarly nature, Sampson was confronted by his union representative and an assistant affirmative action officer, who considered the book's presence inflammatory and akin to Klan propaganda. After an investigation, the university's chief affirmative action officer, Lillian Charleston, sent Sampson a letter accusing him of racial harassment. Following involvement from the ACLU and negative press coverage, the university changed its position, and Charleston sent a new letter stating that reading scholarly material on break time was permissible. The university's media relations attempted to distance the institution from the original accusations, suggesting a mysterious ""harassing behavior"" was the issue, without specifying what that behavior was. The university chancellor eventually expressed regret over the incident after pressure from advocacy groups, but no apology was extended to Sampson directly.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, seems critical of the way affirmative action policies were applied in Sampson's case at IUPUI. She implies that the affirmative action officers at the university overreacted to Sampson's choice of reading material and unjustly accused him of racial harassment. Rabinowitz suggests that such hypersensitivity to race-related issues is not confined to college campuses but is also present in the broader political sphere, as seen in the 2008 presidential election campaign. She points to a culture of quickness to perceive racism in various contexts, which she views as problematic. The correction at the end of the text clarifies that the incident occurred at IUPUI, not Purdue University, and that Purdue University officials were not involved in the case."	0.038470000000000004	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the role of nonprofit foundations in political activities and their influence on public policy, including affirmative action, through organizations such as MALDEF. The author raises concerns about the accountability of such organizations and their representation of communities in debates over policies like affirmative action. However, there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the policy itself, only an observation on the influence of foundations on the policy's discourse. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the role and influence of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations, particularly their involvement in political activities and policy initiatives. Thirty years ago, some foundations were found to have acted as conduits for CIA subsidies during the Cold War, and although the issue was briefly in the spotlight, it faded from public memory. The media, as Nicholas Lemann notes, generally ignores foundations or treats them as innocuous entities. However, the number of foundations has grown significantly, with assets exceeding $200 billion, giving them considerable influence over public policy and social programs. The text highlights that tax exemption is granted under the condition that foundations do not attempt to influence political outcomes, a rule that is often violated. The government also funds politically active nonprofits, a practice that has been criticized and scrutinized by some members of Congress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the discussion about the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF). The author points out that MALDEF, which has no members and relies heavily on funding from corporations and foundations like the Ford Foundation, claims to represent all Mexican Americans and Latinos in debates over immigration and affirmative action. This raises questions about the organization's accountability and the legitimacy of its representation. The author suggests that such foundations may lack direct accountability to the communities they aim to represent, implying a critique of how affirmative action and related policies are influenced and shaped by entities that may not have a grassroots connection to the affected communities. The author also notes that conservative foundations have funded books and policy ideas that have impacted public discourse on issues like affirmative action, indicating that the author is aware of the ideological battles surrounding the topic."	0.032240000000000005	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's nuanced view on affirmative action suggests that they acknowledge the historical necessity of such policies but also believe in the goal of a society where merit is the primary criterion for success. They criticize the extreme stances of both sides in the debate and seem to advocate for a balanced approach that seeks to address current inequalities while moving towards a society that values talent and character over race. The author's use of the NFL's progress as an example indicates a belief in the possibility of overcoming racial barriers and suggests a desire for a fair society without the need for race-based policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the contentious debate surrounding affirmative action, highlighted by the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the Senate Judiciary Committee's arguments over Bill Lann Lee's nomination. The author criticizes both sides of the debate for their extreme stances: one side denies the current relevance of racial discrimination, while the other accuses all opponents of affirmative action of racism. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue, with both blatant discrimination being largely a thing of the past, yet racial fairness still not being fully realized in various sectors. The author suggests that the debate should shift towards how to create a fair society that values talent and character over race, noting that most Americans likely desire fairness and equality. The author concludes by reflecting on the progress in the NFL, where black quarterbacks are no longer a rarity, suggesting that this kind of change is a sign of moving toward a society where race is less of a determinant of success.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. While acknowledging the historical necessity of affirmative action to address past injustices and discrimination, the author also seems to believe that the ultimate goal should be a colorblind society where individual merit is the primary basis for advancement. The author criticizes the polarized nature of the debate and suggests that both sides have valid points but are unwilling to acknowledge the partial truths of the opposing perspective. The author seems to advocate for a middle path that recognizes the progress made while still striving to address the present-day inequalities that persist. The use of the NFL example indicates the author's belief in the potential for institutions to evolve beyond discriminatory practices and for society to reach a point where race is no longer a significant barrier to success."	0.02844	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author expresses a clear and affirmative stance in favor of affirmative action, citing it as a necessary tool to combat discrimination and promote diversity and equal opportunity. They are concerned about the rollback of these policies and suggest that they are needed to address systemic inequalities. The author's call for a national conversation about race and their emphasis on the importance of recognizing the worth and dignity of every individual further underscore their support for the principles behind affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 40th anniversary of the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, by nine African American students, an event that was a significant milestone in the civil rights movement. President Clinton is set to honor these individuals, and the author shares their personal experiences with racial integration and discrimination, including being sprayed with water by firemen during a sit-in and being barred from school sports. Despite progress in various areas, the author points out that racism still persists, albeit in more subtle forms, and that affirmative action is necessary to combat discrimination and promote diversity. The author, who is the Secretary of Transportation, calls for a national conversation about race to build a society that values all people and provides equal opportunities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a crucial measure to address ongoing racial disparities and to foster diversity and equal opportunity, particularly in education and the workforce. They express concern over the rollback of affirmative action policies leading to decreased minority enrollment in state universities, suggesting that such policies are still needed to counteract systemic inequalities. The author believes that while laws can change institutions, they cannot change people's hearts, implying that affirmative action is part of a broader effort to create a more inclusive and equitable society. They advocate for an honest dialogue about race and for recognizing the worth and dignity of every individual, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action to create a more just and diverse society."	0.025740000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion presents a nuanced view of affirmative action. They recognize the potential constitutional issues with the University of Michigan's admissions policy and the implications of the Bakke decision, suggesting a need for affirmative action policies to align with legal precedents. However, the author also shows an understanding of the complexities involved in admissions processes and the importance of considering evidence fully. They express concern over the Fifth Circuit's handling of a related case, indicating a belief that the Supreme Court should be the ultimate arbiter on such constitutional matters. The author's careful approach to the topic, without outright condemnation or endorsement, suggests a balanced perspective that leans towards the support of affirmative action, provided it is constitutionally viable and properly executed.	"Summary:
Jennifer Gratz filed a lawsuit against the University of Michigan, challenging its undergraduate admissions policy based on affirmative action. If Gratz wins, the university may have to abandon its program, potentially leading to a decrease in minority enrollments, as seen in California and Texas. If she loses, the case could reach the Supreme Court, which has shown skepticism towards affirmative action. Gratz, represented by the Center for Individual Rights, argues she was discriminated against because she is white. Michigan's admissions guidelines, which have since been altered, seemed to suggest different standards for minority applicants, which could conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in the 1978 Bakke case, which allows race to be a factor but not to the exclusion of any candidate. However, the complexity of admissions and other preferences (like legacy and geographic factors) make it hard to prove that race was the sole reason for rejection. The article also touches on the legal standing of Bakke, especially after the Fifth Circuit's ruling against the University of Texas, which the Supreme Court did not review.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be cautious and balanced. On one hand, they acknowledge the constitutional problems with the University of Michigan's previous guidelines, which suggested a dual standard that could potentially violate the principles established in the Bakke case. On the other hand, the author is hesitant to condemn the entire affirmative action system without full consideration of the evidence and the complexities of university admissions processes. The author also criticizes the Fifth Circuit's ruling against the University of Texas for prematurely deciding on a constitutional question that should be left to the Supreme Court. The author appears to believe that there is still a constitutional way to factor race into admissions to promote diversity within the narrow confines allowed by the Supreme Court's previous rulings. Overall, the author seems to support the idea of affirmative action but stresses the need for such programs to be constitutionally sound and carefully implemented."	0.02908	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text summary. The summary focuses on foreign policy, trade negotiations, and the Multilateral Agreement on Investments. While affirmative action is mentioned, it is only in the context of how the MAI might impact domestic laws, including affirmative action. There is no indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as they do not express support or opposition to the policy itself. The author's main concern appears to be the implications of international agreements on local laws rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the increasing complexity of foreign policy and trade negotiations in the context of a proposal by Maryland state legislator Rushern L. Baker III to impose sanctions against companies doing business in Nigeria due to human rights abuses. U.S. State Department officials are finding themselves having to negotiate not only with foreign entities but also with American lawmakers due to the growing interconnectedness of the U.S. with global trade and investment. The article highlights how trade talks now involve non-tariff barriers such as corruption, labor laws, and health regulations, and how these talks can impact domestic laws and practices. The piece also touches on the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI), which aims to create a level playing field for foreign investment but has faced criticism for potentially overriding local laws and regulations. The author notes that U.S. officials are being cautious with the MAI, learning from past experiences to consult with various stakeholders before finalizing treaties.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, affirmative action is mentioned in the context of the potential impact of the MAI on domestic laws. The author lists affirmative action among various local laws and regulations that critics fear could be challenged under the treaty. The concern is that the MAI could forbid countries from implementing policies like affirmative action if they are seen as discriminatory against foreign companies. The author reports on the U.S. officials' assurances that existing laws, including affirmative action, would not be affected and would be grandfathered into the agreement. This indicates that the author is aware of the debate surrounding the treaty and its implications for affirmative action but does not offer a personal viewpoint on the policy itself."	0.030760000000000003	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be definitively categorized based on the provided summary, as there is no explicit mention of the author's stance on the policy. The summary focuses on the progress of African Americans in higher education, as reported by Michael T. Nettles, and acknowledges both the advancements and the ongoing challenges faced by this demographic. The author's acknowledgment of the complexity of educational advancement and the need to build upon current successes may suggest a nuanced view that recognizes the role of policies like affirmative action, but without explicit support or opposition expressed, the most accurate categorization is 'neutral'.	"Summary:
The text is a discussion with Michael T. Nettles, a professor of education at the University of Michigan and executive director of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute. Nettles authored a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education,"" which highlights the significant progress African Americans have made in higher education over the past 20 years. According to Nettles, there has been a 50 percent increase in African American baccalaureate degree recipients from 1976 to 1996, with current numbers reaching 89,000. This improvement is seen across various types of institutions and regions, with the South leading in numbers. While acknowledging that there is still work to be done in areas such as enrollment, graduation rates, and faculty representation, Nettles emphasizes the positive trends and the need to recognize and build upon these successes.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. However, the author seems to agree with Nettles's positive view of the progress made by African Americans in higher education, which could suggest a recognition of the potential benefits of affirmative action policies in contributing to such progress. The author acknowledges the ongoing challenges, such as the gender disparity among African American undergraduates and the lower college-going rates for young black males, hinting at the complexity of issues surrounding educational advancement. The author seems to value the importance of understanding where successes lie in order to strategize for future progress, which could imply support for policies like affirmative action that aim to address inequalities and improve opportunities for underrepresented groups."	0.0281	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be critical of affirmative action by suggesting that such policies might not be conducive to achieving a society where race is acknowledged but not consequential. The use of terms like 'racial spoils system' and the assertion that these policies may perpetuate racial divisions indicate a negative view of affirmative action. The author's critique of Bill Bradley's approach, which includes affirmative action, and the implication that there might be 'honest differences of opinion among decent people' further supports the idea that the author is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author discusses the political landscape surrounding Bill Bradley and Al Gore, highlighting Bradley's increasing support as his poll numbers rise, and Gore's challenges as he makes controversial statements and faces competition from George W. Bush. Gore's recent comments on environmental policy and his book ""Earth in the Balance"" are criticized for their moral certitude and perceived moral superiority. Bradley's speech on race at Cooper Union is dissected, with the author suggesting that Bradley's approach to racial issues, which includes calling for ""racial healing"" and criticizing ""white indifference and black suspicion,"" is steeped in sanctimony. The author references Bradley's past accusations against President Bush and Ronald Reagan, and his commentary on the Los Angeles riots. Bradley's stance on identity politics and race is examined, with the author questioning whether Democratic policies like affirmative action and categorical representation hinder progress towards a society where race exists but doesn't matter.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action and similar policies, suggesting that they are part of a ""racial spoils system"" that may actually impede achieving a society where race is acknowledged but not consequential. The author seems to believe that Bradley's ""self-advertised candor"" does not acknowledge the possibility that affirmative action and identity politics could make it more difficult to overcome racial divisions. The tone suggests that the author views these policies as divisive and as an obsession over race that might perpetuate the very issues they aim to resolve. The author implies that Bradley's and the Democrats' approach to race, which includes affirmative action, does not consider that there might be honest differences of opinion among decent people, and instead attributes America's failure to meet Bradley's standards of racial honesty to moral inadequacies in those who disagree with him."	0.029480000000000003	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action but rather discusses how the issue has been handled politically during the Clinton administration and by presidential candidates. The discussion centers around the shift in political strategy and the move towards a centrist approach to affirmative action, rather than a clear endorsement or condemnation of the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the focus of the text, and the author's personal stance cannot be determined based solely on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the changing political climate in the United States, highlighting the decline of populism and the rise of elite influence in politics during the Clinton administration. It argues that the successes of the Clinton era, such as a strong economy, reduced crime, and effective military interventions, have led to increased public satisfaction and acceptance of elite leadership. The article also notes that Clinton's strategic use of polling and policy-making has helped to co-opt traditionally populist issues and temper populist fervor. The author points out that both Al Gore and George W. Bush, despite their establishment backgrounds, are well-positioned to benefit from the current elite-dominated political environment. The article suggests that regardless of who wins the presidency, the trend will likely continue with a focus on maintaining prosperity rather than populist appeals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as one of the issues that has been influenced by elite values during the Clinton years. The article mentions that presidential candidates, including Bush and Elizabeth Dole, have sought to soften traditional Republican opposition to affirmative action, indicating a shift towards more tolerance and away from populist grievances. The author points out Clinton's nuanced stance on affirmative action, summarized by the phrase ""mend it, don't end it,"" as an example of how elite-driven policy-making can temper populist sentiments. This suggests that the author sees the handling of affirmative action as part of a broader trend where elite consensus shapes the political approach to contentious issues, moving away from more extreme positions and towards centrist, majority-supported views."	0.03676	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text does not directly express their personal stance on affirmative action, but rather discusses the perspectives of white conservative voters on the policy. The author seems to be analyzing and questioning the dynamics of race and political ideology among conservatives, particularly in the context of their support for black candidates. The author hints at a critique of the conservative viewpoint on affirmative action by referring to it as 'Satan's own tool,' but this is presented as part of the narrative on conservative beliefs rather than the author's own belief. The text suggests a call for broader racial understanding rather than a clear stance for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's reflections on the reception of African American Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes by white conservative voters, particularly in the context of the 2000 presidential race. The author is intrigued by the possibility that white voters are capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race when making their voting decisions. The author cites instances where white voters have supported black candidates, like David Dinkins and Doug Wilder, but notes that some believe this support may be influenced by racial guilt. The author recalls a televised interview with Iowan conservatives who preferred Keyes over another conservative candidate, Gary Bauer, based on issues rather than race. The author also reflects on Strom Thurmond's support for Clarence Thomas during his Supreme Court nomination, suggesting that Thurmond, too, may have been motivated by political philosophy rather than race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is suggested to be critical of white conservatives' views on the policy. The author describes affirmative action as something that these conservatives deem ""Satan's own tool,"" implying a strong opposition to the policy from that demographic. The author seems to challenge the notion that white conservatives can only support African American candidates who share their disdain for affirmative action and other policies typically opposed by conservative voters. The author suggests that there is a need for both sides to disentangle their preconceived notions about race and political ideology, and that the willingness of conservatives to look beyond race may offer hope for broader racial understanding and cooperation."	0.02608	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author shows a clear concern for the future of affirmative action, especially in light of political shifts within the Democratic Party. By questioning whether these shifts will impact affirmative action policies, and advocating for transparency from presidential candidates on their potential administration members, the author's perspective indicates that they believe affirmative action is an important policy for ensuring diversity and inclusion. The author's focus on the potential influence of the center-right Democratic Leadership Council on Al Gore's administration suggests a belief that affirmative action could be at risk. However, the text does not provide an explicit endorsement or rejection of affirmative action, so the stance is inferred from the context rather than stated outright.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the importance of presidential candidates revealing their potential administration members before the election. The author argues that knowing who will help run the federal government should be a priority for voters, as these individuals will shape national policy. The text criticizes the lack of transparency from both George W. Bush and Al Gore regarding who would be on their respective teams if elected. It highlights the importance of diversity and inclusion, noting that the Republican National Convention's portrayal of diversity may not match the reality of Bush's potential administration. The author also points out a shift within the Democratic Party towards the center-right and questions whether this will affect Al Gore's stance on affirmative action and other policies important to minority communities. The column advocates for voters being better informed about the potential cabinet and advisors of the candidates before casting their votes, suggesting that a mid-October disclosure of the future cabinet could be a reasonable expectation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses concern about the future of affirmative action, particularly in the context of Al Gore's potential administration. There is an implication that the Democratic Leadership Council's (DLC) increased influence could lead to a rollback in affirmative action policies. The DLC is described as center-right, and the author seems to suggest that its dominance over the Democratic presidential ticket could negatively impact progress on racial diversity and inclusion. The author believes that voters, especially African Americans and other voters of color, have a right to know if the shift in the Democratic Party's orientation will affect affirmative action and other policies aimed at reducing inequalities. The perspective is that affirmative action is a critical issue, and the electorate should be aware of the candidates' plans regarding it before the election."	0.03218	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, focusing more on reporting Joseph Lieberman's political maneuvering and positions rather than expressing a personal opinion on the policy itself. The text describes Lieberman's past skepticism of affirmative action but also notes his endorsement of the policy during a speech, suggesting a shift in his stance to align with the Democratic Party. The author's main concern seems to be the political implications of Lieberman's positions rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy.	"Summary:
Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the American public during a speech that emphasized his personal background as a classic American success story and his alignment with core Democratic values. Despite being known for his integrity and willingness to criticize his own party, including his previous critiques of Clinton-Gore fundraising and President Clinton's ethical lapses, Lieberman presented himself as a mainstream Democrat. He avoided discussing his past independent stances on issues like President Clinton's conduct, fundraising practices, affirmative action, tort reform, and school vouchers—topics that might conflict with the Democratic Party's core constituents. Instead, he focused on areas of agreement with Al Gore, such as health care and environmental policy, and drew distinctions between Democrats and Republicans on tax plans and social security. The speech also touched on the need for new ideas within the Democratic Party, particularly in education, while maintaining their position as the party of fiscal responsibility and innovation in government.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author notes that Joseph Lieberman has previously questioned affirmative action, indicating a level of skepticism or criticism towards the policy. However, during his speech, Lieberman endorsed affirmative action, which suggests that he may have moderated his stance to align with the Democratic Party's platform or to maintain party unity. The author seems to recognize Lieberman's past willingness to engage with the complexities of affirmative action and other issues, but points out the challenge that the Gore-Lieberman ticket faces in offering new ideas while staying within the boundaries of what is acceptable to the Democratic Party's central supporters. The author's perspective implies that there is a tension between Lieberman's personal views and the positions he must publicly endorse as part of the Democratic ticket."	0.026749999999999996	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to affirmative action beliefs indicates a critical view of Ashcroft's stance against affirmative action. The author seems concerned that Ashcroft's conservative views, including his stance on affirmative action, could negatively impact his potential role as attorney general. While the author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, the concern over Ashcroft's opposition to it suggests the author believes in the importance of affirmative action or at least the inappropriateness of rejecting a nominee based on their support for it. Therefore, the author is critical of Ashcroft's opposition to affirmative action but does not necessarily advocate strongly for or against affirmative action themselves.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding John Ashcroft's nomination for attorney general. While Ashcroft's supporters argue that he is qualified and would enforce the law fairly, the author emphasizes that the attorney general's role goes beyond just enforcement; it involves setting law enforcement policies and deciding how to prioritize resources. The author points out that Ashcroft has a record of advocating for conservative positions that are outside the mainstream on issues like gun control, abortion, juvenile justice, and the death penalty. The author also notes Ashcroft's response to a question about Roe v. Wade, interpreting it as an acknowledgment that personal views can influence policy decisions. The text recalls Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil rights division based on Lee's beliefs on affirmative action, suggesting that the same standard should be applied to Ashcroft's nomination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of Ashcroft's stance on affirmative action, as evidenced by the reference to Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's appointment due to Lee's support for affirmative action. The author implies that Ashcroft's conservative views, including his opposition to affirmative action, could unduly influence his role as attorney general, affecting his judgment and policy decisions. The author's perspective suggests a concern that personal and ideological beliefs, particularly those that are not mainstream, may not be suitable for someone in a position that requires a balanced approach to law enforcement policy. The mention of Ashcroft's opposition to Lee serves to highlight the potential for inconsistency in Ashcroft's own stance, as the same logic he applied to Lee could be applied to his own nomination."	0.02787	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author mentions affirmative action only in passing, with a focus on the statistics of President Bush's appointments. The author neither explicitly supports nor criticizes affirmative action policies, instead simply stating the administration's claim and providing relevant appointment statistics. The lack of a clear evaluative stance on the policy itself suggests that the author is neutral or not concerned with the topic of affirmative action in the context of this text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the backlash faced by the Bush administration for rescinding a Clinton-era regulation that lowered arsenic levels in drinking water. Jonathan Adler, a former senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, criticized the administration's handling of the issue, blaming poor communication and the lack of understanding among environmental journalists. Environmental groups, on the other hand, argue that the facts did not support the administration's position, noting that the old federal standard on arsenic was outdated and did not account for its carcinogenic properties. The text also touches on a fundraiser for Senator Maria Cantwell, the appointment of Charles A. Heimbold Jr. as ambassador to Sweden, and the status of other ambassadorial candidates. It concludes with statistics on the diversity of President Bush's appointments compared to previous administrations, highlighting that there is no affirmative action in these selections, yet a significant percentage of appointments have been women and minorities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action in the context of President Bush's appointments to top-tier positions, stating that the administration claims there is no affirmative action at play. However, the author provides statistics showing that 40 percent of Bush's appointments for positions requiring Senate confirmation have been women and minorities. This is presented as a factual statement without explicit endorsement or criticism of affirmative action policies. The comparison with previous administrations suggests a recognition of increased diversity under the Bush administration, but the author does not delve into a discussion on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.025160000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's critique of conservatives' approach to affirmative action, specifically their desire to use the judiciary to overturn policies made by elected branches, indicates a disagreement with the conservative stance on the issue. The author's argument that conservatives are inconsistent in their judicial philosophy when it comes to affirmative action suggests that the author may support affirmative action or at least opposes the conservative method of challenging it. However, the text provided does not contain enough direct information about the author's personal stance on affirmative action to categorize them definitively. The author's focus is more on the critique of conservatives' inconsistency rather than on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the conservative interpretation of the Constitution's ""advice and consent"" clause regarding the appointment of judges. The author highlights the contradiction in conservatives' strict constructionist approach to the Constitution, noting that when it comes to judicial nominations, conservatives impose additional limitations on the Senate's consent power that are not explicitly stated in the Constitution. The author argues that the Senate is entitled to scrutinize judicial nominees' philosophies and reject some based on their ideologies, particularly regarding judicial matters. Conservatives are criticized for presenting their judicial philosophy as beyond dispute and for disregarding it when it suits their purposes. The text also touches on the political dynamics of judicial nominations, referencing the treatment of Clinton's nominees and the Institute of Justice's stance on judicial activism and affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as gleaned from the text, is critical of conservatives' approach to the issue. The author suggests that conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn affirmative action policies made by elected branches of government. This is seen as an inconsistency in their philosophy, as they generally advocate for judicial restraint and deference to the elected branches. The author implies that conservatives' arguments against affirmative action are ideologically driven rather than rooted in a consistent application of constitutional principles. This critique is exemplified by the discussion of the Institute of Justice's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination because he did not share their views on affirmative action, despite the organization's professed belief that ""mere philosophical differences"" should not influence Senate approval of judges."	0.030270000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author does not directly state a position on affirmative action as a policy. However, they express concern about the lack of ideological diversity within academia, suggesting that certain political orientations, including those supportive of affirmative action, have become dominant to the exclusion of conservative views. The author implies that affirmative action, as part of these dominant political orientations, may contribute to the filtering out of conservative viewpoints in academic fields. While the author's focus is on the broader issue of political imbalance and not specifically on affirmative action, the critical tone towards the exclusion of conservative perspectives in academia suggests a somewhat negative view of the effects of affirmative action within this context.	"Summary:
The article discusses the political imbalance within academia, where studies have found a significant outnumbering of Republicans by Democrats, especially in the humanities and social sciences. The ratio of Democrats to Republicans has increased over time, with younger professors being more liberal than the older retiring ones. Voter registration records from various universities show a substantial lean towards Democrats among faculty members. The University of California system and Harvard are noted for their substantial financial contributions to Democratic presidential candidates. George Lakoff, a professor at Berkeley, argues that the disparity is not due to bias but rather because conservatives are less interested in academic careers, as they do not prioritize the public good and social justice in the same way liberals do.

Mark Bauerlein, a professor at Emory University, suggests that a filtering process from graduate school to tenure decisions tends to exclude conservatives, creating a ""sheltered habitat"" in academia. Academic fields have developed dominant premises that incorporate political orientations into their definitions of scholarship, effectively barring those with opposing views. Bauerlein also discusses the ""false consensus effect"" and ""the law of group polarization,"" where like-minded individuals in academia become more extreme in their beliefs and out of touch with those outside their circle. The article concludes by suggesting that academia's political one-sidedness and lack of ideological diversity have led to its marginalization in wider society, despite its claims of commitment to diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly within the context of academia. The author implies that affirmative action is an embedded political orientation that has become a regnant premise in certain academic fields, such as African-American studies and women's studies. The suggestion is that if one disapproves of affirmative action, pursuing a degree or a career in these fields is not feasible. This perspective is indicative of the author's broader argument that political bias in academia excludes conservative viewpoints and that the fields have become ideologically monolithic, prioritizing social justice and liberal values to the exclusion of conservative ones. The author seems to view affirmative action as part of the broader issue of ideological conformity and the lack of intellectual diversity in higher education."	0.03262	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The text provided does not offer a clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action. It focuses on the Supreme Court's privacy practices, Justice Rehnquist's health, and a study of Justice O'Connor's voting patterns, which affected the outcome of an affirmative action case. The discussion of affirmative action is limited to its connection with the study's findings and does not include the author's own views or arguments for or against the policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's reticence in disclosing details about Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health following his cancer diagnosis and treatment. It reflects on the tradition of the court's privacy regarding justices' personal lives, which is being questioned due to the court's significant role in policymaking. Some argue that the public has a right to know about the chief justice's health, given the potential impact on the court's functioning, while others defend the court's discretion, noting the constitutional differences between the judiciary and other branches of government.

Regarding affirmative action, the text references a study by political scientists published in the North Carolina Law Review that analyzes Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's voting patterns. The study uses a numerical scale to rank justices' ideological leanings based on their votes. It concludes that O'Connor, often considered the court's ""median voter,"" has shifted to the left over the years. This shift is significant because, according to the study, without O'Connor's evolution, the Supreme Court would not have upheld affirmative action in college admissions in a 5-4 vote in 2003, with O'Connor authoring the majority opinion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their perspective on affirmative action. However, the text indicates that the study's findings on Justice O'Connor's ideological shift were pivotal for the Supreme Court's approval of affirmative action in college admissions. The authors of the study suggest that O'Connor's leftward movement over the years increased the likelihood of her providing the key vote to uphold the affirmative action program, which she did in 2003. This information implies that individual justices' ideologies and their shifts over time can have a significant impact on landmark decisions, such as those related to affirmative action."	0.027120000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the broader issue of judicial independence and the role of judges in reflecting the views of national majorities. While affirmative action is mentioned, it is only in the context of illustrating the alignment of the judiciary with majority opinions, rather than expressing a personal stance on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the increasing threats and political attacks on judges in the United States, particularly in light of the Terri Schiavo case and other high-profile incidents. The author suggests that the judicial system is being personalized, with judges being targeted rather than their decisions. This trend is attributed to the legalization of politics, where judges are asked to decide on issues that politics fail to resolve. The piece criticizes Congress and the President for attempting to override judicial decisions they disagree with, and for contributing to a hostile environment towards the judiciary. The article also points out that, contrary to accusations of elitism and activism, judges often reflect the constitutional views of national majorities. The author warns against the personalization of the judiciary and suggests that judges should maintain their independence by adhering to the law and avoiding public attention.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jeffrey Rosen, touches on affirmative action as part of a broader discussion about the judiciary's role in reflecting the views of a narrow majority of Americans. He references the work of Mark Tushnet, who argues in his book ""A Court Divided"" that the Rehnquist court has supported the majority's views in controversial cases, including affirmative action. Rosen implies that the judiciary, in cases involving affirmative action, has not acted as an anti-democratic force but rather has aligned with the prevailing sentiments of the populace. The author does not express a personal opinion on affirmative action itself but uses it as an example to counter claims that judges are out of step with democratic values."	0.03373	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not directly address or express a stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. The focus of the article is on the influence of interest groups in American politics and how they shape the political agenda. Affirmative action is mentioned as an example of a divisive issue that interest groups are passionate about, but the author's personal perspective on the policy is not discussed.	"Summary:
The article discusses the influence of interest groups in American politics, emphasizing that Social Security is not the biggest fiscal issue facing the nation, contrary to its high visibility on the political agenda. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, points out that Medicare and Medicaid pose more significant financial challenges. The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, suggests that the prominence of issues like Social Security, Terri Schiavo's case, and judicial nominations in Washington is the result of long-term efforts by well-funded organizations rather than serendipity or political leadership. Birnbaum argues that these groups, through their persistence and ability to mobilize support, have become more influential than political parties in setting the political agenda. He provides examples of how organizations like the AARP, the National Federation of Independent Business, and pro-life groups have successfully brought their issues to the forefront. The article concludes that while organized interests can make a difference, not every critical issue has a group advocating for it, leaving many important concerns unaddressed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express his personal views on affirmative action within the provided text. However, he does mention affirmative action as one of the divisive issues that interest groups on both the political left and right are passionate about, particularly in the context of the battle over judicial nominations. The text implies that the author recognizes the role of interest groups in shaping public policy and debate around issues like affirmative action, but he does not explicitly state his stance on the policy itself."	0.03839	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, and their stance is not explicitly stated. The text provides an overview of Tel Aviv's history, culture, and social dynamics, mentioning affirmative action only in passing. The author notes the policy's existence in the context of hiring Israeli Arabs and illustrates the city's progressive reputation. However, there is an implication of dissatisfaction or ineffectiveness with the brief mention of a 'wince' from a city official when discussing the status of Arab citizens. This suggests that while affirmative action is recognized as a policy, there may be concerns about its impact. Given the limited information, the author's stance on affirmative action appears neutral, as they neither advocate for nor criticize the policy in any strong terms, but rather present it as a fact within the broader narrative of the city.	"Summary:
The text provides a historical and cultural overview of Tel Aviv, Israel. It begins by referencing the ancient port of Jaffa and its biblical significance. The narrative then transitions to the development of Tel Aviv in the late 1800s, highlighting its evolution from a point of arrival for Zionist immigrants into a modern Jewish city known for its vibrant nightlife and cultural significance. The city is described as a mix of Manhattan, L.A., and Ibiza, reflecting a diverse and liberal atmosphere that some see as the fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's Zionist vision, while others view it as detached from the conflicts that characterize other Israeli cities like Jerusalem.

The author notes that Tel Aviv has a population of about 400,000, with nearly half of Israel's 7 million people living in the surrounding areas. The city's history includes violence, such as suicide bombings and Scud missile attacks during the Persian Gulf War. The text also mentions the displacement of Arab families during the formation of Israel and the preservation efforts of Bauhaus architecture by conservation director Jeremie Hoffman. Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, discusses challenges such as rising property values and the need for rent-control laws to maintain affordability.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is a policy implemented by the city to promote the hiring of Israeli Arabs. While Tel Aviv is seen as left-wing and progressive, there is an acknowledgment that the city maintains a certain distance from the conflict. The text illustrates this through the mayoral candidacy of Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka, an Arab woman who raised concerns about the gentrification of Jaffa's Arab neighborhoods. Although her candidacy did not receive widespread support, it was endorsed by individuals like writer Avner Bernheimer, who believed that her leadership could bring about change.

The article concludes by contrasting the quiet observance of the Jewish Sabbath in more conservative towns with the ongoing nightlife in Tel Aviv, where the party continues into the early hours. The city's openness to diversity, including the LGBTQ community and those with different political and artistic ideas, is highlighted as a key factor in its modern identity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action in Tel Aviv as a policy that is in place but perhaps not fully embraced or effective. The mention of affirmative action is brief and is brought up in the context of a wince from Yael Dayan when discussing the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, suggesting that there might be underlying issues or dissatisfaction with the implementation or impact of these policies. The perspective seems to acknowledge the existence of affirmative action as a step towards inclusivity and diversity, but also implies that it might not be sufficient to address deeper societal and cultural divides within the city."	0.042499999999999996	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text. Instead, the text is primarily concerned with Ralph Reed's Samaritan Project and its potential to foster racial reconciliation and aid inner-city communities. While the author notes Reed's opposition to affirmative action, the author's own stance on the issue is not clearly articulated. The discussion is more about the political and social implications of the Samaritan Project rather than a direct commentary on affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author seems to be 'not concerned' with affirmative action in the context of this text, as their stance on it is not explicitly expressed.	"The text discusses the initiative by Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, to bridge the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. Reed acknowledges the historical wrongs of religious conservatives in the context of slavery and segregation and proposes the Samaritan Project as a means to make amends. The project aims to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods through partnerships between the coalition's network of churches and inner-city congregations, particularly focusing on aiding at-risk youths.

The author of the text appears to be cautiously optimistic about the initiative, recognizing the potential for genuine social change while also noting the political benefits that conservatives might reap from the project. The author mentions that the project has already seen some success, with funds raised and granted to churches affected by burnings. The Christian Coalition's efforts are seen as a way to bring attention to the often-overlooked successes of black churches in supporting their communities.

Regarding affirmative action, the author points out that Reed has been a vocal opponent of mainstream civil rights leaders on this issue. However, the text suggests that the Samaritan Project could represent a shift in conservative approaches to racial justice and an attempt to find common ground. The author acknowledges the skepticism that some might have about the project's intentions but expresses a desire to see a competitive environment where both conservatives and liberals vie for African-American support in politics. The author sees the involvement of churches in leading the charge for racial reconciliation as a positive development and is open to the possibility of progress through such initiatives."	0.02676	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports Mayor Daley's initiative to diversify the Chicago police force, which is a form of affirmative action. They argue that a diverse police force is necessary for the city's effectiveness and recognize the importance of the mayor's plan despite acknowledging potential criticisms and challenges. The author's support for a measure that is designed to promote racial and ethnic balance within the police force indicates a positive stance towards affirmative action, although they also caution against the potential misuse of subjective criteria in promotions.	"Summary:
The text discusses the strategy announced by Mayor Richard Daley's administration to diversify the Chicago police force so that it better reflects the city's ethnic and racial makeup. The plan involves promoting sergeants not solely based on written test results but also on job performance, aiming for a racial and ethnic balance. This approach has faced criticism from police union bosses, who accuse the mayor of potentially reintroducing political cronyism, and from the African-American Police League, which feels insulted by the implication that special measures are needed for black sergeants and claims the test is racially biased. The author acknowledges the possibility of judicial challenges to the plan, given the trend against race-based systems, but argues that the city's need for an effective, diverse police force should be recognized. The author supports the mayor's plan but suggests that job performance should be a factor in all promotions and warns against the potential abuse of this more subjective criterion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be in favor of affirmative action as a means to create a police force that is reflective of the city's diverse population. They applaud Mayor Daley's efforts to promote racial and ethnic balance within the police force and argue that it is necessary for the development of an effective police force in a diverse city like Chicago. The author distinguishes between affirmative action quotas and the practical needs of a diverse city, implying that such measures are not merely about meeting quotas but about ensuring the police force can effectively serve the community. The author also acknowledges the potential for abuse in the implementation of performance-based promotions but still believes that the mayor's plan is a step in the right direction and deserves support."	0.0238	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern over the decrease in black student representation at the University of California-Berkeley's law school following a ban on affirmative action, implying that such policies are necessary for promoting equality and integration. This concern suggests that the author views affirmative action as a crucial tool for maintaining the progress of the civil rights movement. The reflection on the consequences of the absence of affirmative action policies indicates a stance that is supportive of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the memorial service for Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, which was attended by many prominent figures, contrasting with the sparsely attended funeral of Malcolm X in 1965. The article highlights Shabazz's achievements and her role as a civil rights proponent. It also touches on the ongoing challenges within the black community regarding integration and the legacy of Malcolm X's philosophies. The piece concludes with a reflection on the consequences of affirmative action policies, citing the example of the University of California-Berkeley's law school, which will have only one black student in its incoming class due to a ban on affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as a necessary tool to promote equality and integration, as evidenced by the concern over the University of California-Berkeley's law school's incoming class demographics following a ban on affirmative action. The implication is that without such policies, the representation of black students and, by extension, other minority groups could significantly decrease. The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, suggest that the lack of affirmative action may lead to increased separateness and inequality, which they see as a major issue in the aftermath of the civil rights era. They appear to advocate for affirmative action as a means to address systemic issues and to promote the integration and equality that the civil rights movement fought for."	0.022010000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text acknowledges that Graglia's points about minority underperformance have some validity but criticizes the implication that this underperformance is inherent to minorities. By emphasizing the need to consider socioeconomic factors and historical discrimination, the author shows an understanding of the complexities surrounding affirmative action and minority achievement. The call for a nuanced discussion on the subject suggests that the author believes in the importance of addressing these complexities rather than taking a simplistic or dismissive stance. Therefore, the author does not seem to fully align with Graglia's opposition to affirmative action and instead appears to be advocating for a more informed and balanced approach to the debate.	"Summary:
Law Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas at Austin made controversial remarks suggesting that Black and Mexican-American students are not academically competitive with whites in selective institutions and that their cultures do not encourage achievement. His comments sparked outrage among politicians, students, and faculty. While some defended his right to free speech, others called for his dismissal. The author of the text argues that while Graglia has a point about the underperformance of minorities in academic institutions, he erred in implying that this underperformance is an inherent trait of minorities. The author suggests that socioeconomic factors and historical discrimination should be considered when discussing minority achievement. The author also criticizes those who are quick to label others as bigots without understanding the context and emphasizes the need for open dialogue on race and education. The author notes that President Clinton and his administration have dismissed Graglia's remarks without engaging in a nuanced discussion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that Graglia's comments were ultimately rooted in his opposition to affirmative action. The author seems to suggest that while Graglia has the right to oppose affirmative action, the manner in which he expressed his views—by implying that minority underachievement is inevitable—was flawed. The author calls for a more nuanced discussion on race and education, implying that affirmative action and its effects on minority achievement in academia are complex issues that require careful consideration of various factors, including historical discrimination and socioeconomic disparities. The author appears to advocate for a dialogue that is informed and respectful, rather than one that is dismissive or overly simplistic."	0.027250000000000003	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical perspective on the elimination of the SAT and the argument against lowering admission standards as a form of affirmative action indicates a stance against affirmative action policies that compromise academic standards. The author emphasizes the importance of improving primary and secondary education for minority students rather than adjusting college admissions criteria to increase diversity. Their focus on academic preparedness over the use of affirmative action in college admissions suggests that they do not support affirmative action in its current form, which they believe may lead to high dropout rates and does not solve the underlying issue of inadequate academic preparation.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California's recommendation to eliminate the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) from admissions criteria to increase the number of Hispanic students eligible for admission. The author argues that the SAT is not culturally biased, as evidenced by Asian-Americans outperforming whites, and that it is a necessary tool for comparing students from different schools. The text also disputes claims that the SAT merely reflects family income and does not predict college success. It suggests that the real issue is the inadequate academic preparation provided to black and Latino students at the elementary and secondary levels, not the SAT itself. The author also mentions the high dropout rates among black undergraduates, suggesting that lowering admissions standards without improving preparatory education would lead to more failures. The text advocates for better primary and secondary education to prepare students for the rigors of college, rather than eliminating the SAT.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They argue that affirmative action, in the form of racial preferences in college admissions, may place minority students in institutions that are too academically demanding, leading to high dropout rates. The author believes that affirmative action policies that lower admission standards are not the solution to the problem of underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos in the University of California system. Instead, the author suggests that the focus should be on improving the quality of education in grade schools and high schools to ensure that these students are adequately prepared for college-level work. The author views the SAT as a necessary tool for assessing a student's readiness for college and opposes the idea of eliminating it to artificially boost minority enrollment, as it would not address the root cause of the problem, which is the poor academic preparation that minority students receive prior to college."	0.0293	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The authors of the text advocate for affirmative action as a means to increase diversity and address historical injustices based on race and gender. They emphasize the importance of equal access to job training programs and suggest that affirmative action can help achieve this goal. Their support for expanding job training opportunities to address disparities and their focus on the benefits of such programs for both employees and employers indicate a positive view of affirmative action. They also discuss the need for mentoring and encouragement in non-traditional fields for women, such as STEM, which aligns with affirmative action goals. The overall tone and content of the summary suggest that the authors are in favor of affirmative action as a tool to ensure equal opportunities and to address systemic issues.	"Summary:
The article reports on a study titled ""Job Training Experiences of Black Women, 1970-1991,"" which examined the participation of black and white women in job training programs over two decades. While the participation rate doubled for both groups, a higher proportion of white women engaged in managerial and professional training. In the 1970s, black women were more likely to be in clerical and semi-skilled training programs and less so in managerial and professional ones. However, by the 1980s, the segregation in job training types disappeared, though overall participation of black women declined. The study also found that job training led to higher wages, regardless of the program's duration or the participant's education and work history.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors believe the study's findings can inform the debate on affirmative action. They suggest that increased income through job training is crucial and that unequal access to these programs along racial lines is a problem. They advocate for affirmative action programs in businesses to increase diversity and address historical injustices based on race and gender. The authors propose expanding job training opportunities (""the job training pie"") rather than restricting access for some groups. They emphasize that such training is an investment in human capital that benefits both employees and employers. The authors argue for continuous learning, especially for mid-career employees, and against stereotyping women into traditional roles. They highlight the importance of mentoring and encouraging young women to pursue STEM education and continuous learning to prepare for the future workplace. The authors stress that businesses cannot afford to waste talent and must ensure equal access to job training for all, including black women who are underrepresented in managerial positions."	0.03053	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, evidenced by their positive view of Mayor Daley's efforts to integrate Chicago's police and fire departments and their criticism of the unions' resistance to these efforts. The author believes affirmative action is necessary to correct historical imbalances and ensure that the departments reflect the city's racial and ethnic makeup. This support is further shown by the call to action for black and Hispanic members to organize and prepare for exams, indicating a belief in the effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the efforts of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago to integrate the city's police and fire departments by promoting more black and Hispanic officers. The police and fire unions have resisted these efforts, with the Fraternal Order of Police running radio ads against affirmative action in promotions, and the Chicago Fire Fighters Union resisting performance-based promotions for over two years. Despite the unions' opposition, Daley is pushing forward with plans to make the departments more reflective of the city's racial and ethnic makeup. The author also calls on black and Hispanic police and firefighters to organize and work hard within their unions to exert power and prepare for exams.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be supportive of affirmative action as a means to correct historical imbalances and promote diversity within the police and fire departments. The author praises Mayor Daley's commitment to integrating the police and fire commands, even if it is motivated by political considerations rather than a pure desire for justice. The author criticizes the police and fire unions for their resistance to affirmative action, portraying their actions as obstructive and out of touch with the needs of minority members. The author suggests that affirmative action is necessary to create opportunities for blacks and Hispanics and to make the departments more representative of the community they serve. Additionally, the author encourages minority members to be proactive in their efforts to gain influence within their unions and prepare for advancement opportunities."	0.02144	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author is critical of the union's proposal to eliminate 'merit' promotions, which they view as a step backwards from affirmative action efforts that benefit minority firefighters. The author sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to promote diversity and address discrimination, and is appalled by the union's attempt to dismantle these advancements. The author's urging of the mayor to reject the union's proposals and to implement reforms against racism indicates a strong support for affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Chicago Fire Fighters Union, led by William Kugelman, has presented an initial contract offer that has been criticized for its aggressive demands and for attempting to undermine affirmative action within the fire department. The union's proposal includes a significant pay increase and changes to work rules, but most controversially, it seeks to eliminate ""merit"" promotions that have benefited minority firefighters and proposes two new paid holidays, one of which (Bud Billiken Day) is seen as a mocking gesture towards the African American community. The author urges Mayor Richard Daley to reject these proposals and to implement reforms to address racism within the fire department.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of the union's stance on affirmative action, particularly the leadership's efforts to revert to a system that does not consider performance alongside test scores and seniority for promotions. The union's opposition to ""merit"" promotions is seen as a step backwards in creating a diverse command structure that reflects the city's population. The author views affirmative action as a necessary tool for promoting diversity and addressing past and present discrimination within the fire department, and they are appalled by the union's attempt to dismantle these advancements. The author believes that the mayor should take a strong stand against the union's regressive proposals and work towards ending ""racist buffoonery"" in the department."	0.01977	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not provide a personal view on affirmative action. The text is centered around the use of online tools for matching voters with presidential candidates and does not delve into the author's perspective on any of the specific issues, including affirmative action. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses how the internet can simplify the process of choosing a presidential candidate through the use of online questionnaires. Websites like selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com match users with candidates based on their answers to questions about various national issues. The author describes their own experience with these sites, noting how they were matched with candidates like Harry Browne, Alan Keyes, and Steve Forbes, and how the sites ranked other candidates in terms of compatibility with the author's views. The author points out the limitations of these websites, such as their lack of consideration for certain issues, experience in office, and temperament. Despite these shortcomings, the author appreciates how the quizzes focus on substantive issues and help voters align with candidates who share their policy preferences.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. While they mention that the questionnaire asks about affirmative action among other issues, they do not provide their personal view on the matter. The focus of the text is more on the general utility of online tools for matching voters with candidates based on a range of issues, rather than on the author's stance on any specific policy."	0.02375	affirmative action	txt/419118450.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion of Justice Clarence Thomas's speech and the themes of 'duty, honor, country' coupled with the admiration for Thomas's courage to challenge conventional wisdom on issues like affirmative action, suggests a supportive stance towards Thomas's perspective. While the author does not explicitly state their position on affirmative action, the positive portrayal of Thomas, who is known for his critical views on affirmative action, implies that the author may share similar sentiments. The author's focus on the need for honest debate and the recognition of the hostility faced by dissenters like Thomas indicates a perspective that is at least somewhat critical of the conventional pro-affirmative action stance within the black community.	"Summary:
The author expresses a sense of disorientation when comparing their perception of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s speech at the American Enterprise Institute's dinner to that of New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. While Dowd described the speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying,"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" the author found it inspiring, emphasizing themes of ""duty, honor, country."" They note the attentive audience and the genuine standing ovation Thomas received. The author also discusses Thomas's experience as a black man who challenges conventional wisdom on issues like affirmative action, school busing, and welfare, suggesting that such dissent is often met with hostility and requires courage.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred through the discussion of Justice Clarence Thomas's views. The author suggests that Thomas, as a black man, has the courage to question ""black"" issues such as affirmative action, implying that these issues are typically not open for debate within the black community and that divergent views are often seen as a form of betrayal. The author appears to support Thomas's willingness to engage in controversial discussions and to advocate for honest debate on such topics. They seem to believe that Thomas's stance on affirmative action and similar issues demonstrates a commitment to principle and truth, and they view his ability to speak out, despite expecting a backlash, as an act of bravery."	0.02515	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's support for affirmative action is evident in the emphasis on the importance of diversity as a positive educational goal. They find the 'diversity rationale' compelling for college admissions and suggest that merit cannot be solely determined by test scores and grades. The author also highlights the educational necessity for diversity, as quoted from University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor, and refutes the idea that a diverse set of ideas can exist without a diverse student body. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is essential for creating a diverse and enriching educational environment, which is crucial in a pluralistic society.	"Summary:
The text discusses the heightened awareness of diversity in America following the events of September 11, 2001. This newfound collective consciousness emphasized the importance of understanding different cultures and backgrounds, as reflected in the increased interest in college courses on international topics. The article then shifts to the debate on affirmative action in college admissions, examining the ""diversity rationale"" as a compelling national interest that justifies considering race and ethnicity in admissions policies. The author notes conflicting court decisions on this issue and suggests that diversity, as an educational goal, is more compelling than the previous standard of remedying past racial discrimination. The text acknowledges the complexity of defining merit in admissions and the varying outcomes for students admitted through affirmative action. University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor is quoted expressing the educational necessity for diversity, especially in the context of fostering understanding among students from different backgrounds.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action policies in higher education, emphasizing the importance of diversity as a positive educational goal that benefits all students. They argue that the ""diversity rationale"" is a compelling reason for universities to consider race and ethnicity in admissions. The author acknowledges that while test scores and grades are important, they are not the sole indicators of merit, and that students admitted through affirmative action can thrive in top schools. Additionally, the author refutes the argument that a diverse set of ideas can exist without a diverse student body, asserting that direct encounters with different people are irreplaceable for challenging and expanding students' perspectives. Overall, the author believes that in a world where pluralistic values are increasingly significant, top schools cannot afford to reduce minority admissions and that affirmative action plays a vital role in creating a diverse and enriching educational environment."	0.02976	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's critique is focused on the corruption and abuse of affirmative action policies rather than the principle of affirmative action itself. The text highlights the misuse of affirmative action to benefit connected individuals rather than its intended beneficiaries—women and minorities. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but the criticism is aimed at the corrupt practices surrounding it, not the concept of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece discussing the indictment of the Duffs, friends of the mayor of Chicago with connections to the Chicago Outfit, for a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud. The author describes the atmosphere at Gene & Georgetti's, a steakhouse where the Duffs confronted him about his reporting. The piece criticizes the mayor, Richard M. Daley, for the corrupt system that allows his friends to profit from government contracts at the expense of taxpayers. The author compares the media treatment of Daley to that of the late Mayor Harold Washington, suggesting that Washington faced tougher scrutiny due to his race. The text also highlights the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, in bringing the Duffs to justice.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly critique the concept of affirmative action itself. Instead, the perspective provided is critical of the abuse of affirmative action policies for personal gain. The Duffs are accused of running phony front companies that were undeservingly awarded city contracts intended for businesses owned by women or minorities. This fraudulent activity undermines the purpose of affirmative action, which is to provide opportunities to historically disadvantaged groups. The author is critical of the corruption and the exploitation of a system designed to promote equality, rather than the principle of affirmative action."	0.02572	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of affirmative action acknowledges both the necessity of the policy for promoting diversity and correcting historical injustices, and the resentment it can cause among those who feel disadvantaged by it. The author's recognition of the 'long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities' suggests support for affirmative action. However, the author also understands the perspective of those who are uncomfortable with the change, describing their resentment as 'understandable, if not admirable.' The call for firefighters who do not condone racism to lead change implies a belief in the importance of affirmative action in creating a fair and equitable workplace. The author's stance appears to be supportive of affirmative action while also empathetic to the challenges it poses, indicating a somewhat in favor position.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of racism within the Chicago Fire Department, highlighted by recent racist radio transmissions and past incidents, including a 1990 firehouse party where firefighters displayed racist behavior. The author expresses outrage at the fact that taxpayer money contributes to a system where such bigotry exists. Fire Commissioner James Joyce and Mayor Richard Daley have taken a firm stance, indicating that such behavior could lead to dismissal. The difficulty in identifying the perpetrators is acknowledged, with the possibility of outside interference considered. The author also touches on the tensions caused by affirmative action within the department and calls on firefighters who do not condone racism to help lead the change and uphold the department's integrity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex. On the one hand, the author recognizes that affirmative action is a measure of fairness, aimed at correcting historical injustices and promoting diversity within the fire department. The author notes that the ""long-overdue accelerated promotion of minorities"" is a cause that Fire Commissioner James Joyce has advanced, which suggests a belief in the necessity of affirmative action to achieve equity.

On the other hand, the author acknowledges that affirmative action has caused resentment among some white firefighters who feel disadvantaged by these policies. The author describes this resentment as ""understandable, if not admirable,"" indicating a recognition of the tension and discomfort that can arise when systems change to become more inclusive.

Overall, the author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary step towards fairness and equality, even while recognizing the challenges and resistance it may face within institutions like the Chicago Fire Department. The author condemns the expression of resentment through racist actions and language and emphasizes the need for all firefighters to serve the public with respect, regardless of their personal feelings about affirmative action."	0.03239	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical discussion of the affirmative action scandal in Chicago, where white individuals fraudulently obtained contracts meant for minority and female-owned firms, indicates skepticism about the policy's implementation. Additionally, the suggestion that Trotter's appointment may be a politically motivated action to protect Mayor Daley's image in light of an upcoming trial implies that the author questions the motivations behind the use of affirmative action in this context. The focus on potential misuse and political maneuvering rather than the policy's principles or effectiveness suggests the author is somewhat against affirmative action, at least in how it is applied in this scenario.	"Summary:
Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago retired his white Fire Commissioner, James Joyce, and appointed Cortez Trotter, a black man with a background as a paramedic and bureaucrat, as the new commissioner. This move is historical because Trotter is the first black man to lead the predominantly white department and because he comes from the paramedic side rather than the firefighting side. Trotter's promotion comes amidst racial controversies and a scandal involving white individuals fraudulently obtaining affirmative action contracts. Trotter has emphasized the importance of diversity and warned against any discriminatory behavior within the department. The author suggests that Trotter's appointment may be politically motivated to protect Daley's image, especially with an upcoming trial related to the affirmative action contract fraud. Trotter faces the challenge of earning the respect of firefighters and managing the department's diversity issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and seems to imply skepticism about its implementation in Chicago. The text highlights a scandal where white individuals, connected to Mayor Daley's friends, fraudulently received $100 million in affirmative action contracts, which were meant for minority and female-owned firms. This instance suggests that the author views affirmative action as a policy that can be exploited for personal gain and does not always benefit the intended groups. Moreover, the author suggests that Trotter's promotion might be a strategic move by Daley to deflect criticism and present a diverse image in the face of the scandal. Trotter's own stance on affirmative action appears to be proactive, as he intends to address diversity issues within the Fire Department, but the author questions whether this is a genuine effort or a political maneuver by the administration."	0.02872	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's criticism is targeted at the misuse and exploitation of affirmative action policies rather than the policies themselves. They highlight the irony and corruption in the system where individuals who are not the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action are able to game the system. The author's sarcasm and critical tone indicate a concern for the integrity of affirmative action and a desire for it to serve its rightful purpose. However, there is no direct indication of the author's stance on affirmative action as a concept or policy when implemented correctly.	"Summary:
The text discusses a controversy involving Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, a former purchasing agent for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, and his connection to questionable affirmative action contracts awarded to the Duffs, a group of white men with alleged mob connections, by the city. The author describes an attempt to contact Grzyb, who was evasive and claimed to have no knowledge or opinions on the matter, despite his significant role in city contracting. The Duffs had managed to secure $100 million in contracts intended for minorities by apparently convincing officials, including Daley, of their minority status. The author criticizes the lack of media attention to the story and implies corruption and cronyism within Daley's administration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical, but not of the concept itself. Instead, the criticism is directed at the abuse of the system by individuals who are not intended beneficiaries of such programs. The author sarcastically questions the integrity of affirmative action when white men with connections like the Duffs can claim minority status and receive contracts meant to level the playing field for actual minority groups. The tone suggests that the author is appalled by the exploitation and mockery of affirmative action policies due to corruption and favoritism in Mayor Daley's administration."	0.026350000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not discernible from the provided summary. The text mentions that affirmative action was a topic of discussion in the presidential debate without offering any specific insight into the author's views on the issue. The focus of the text is on the dynamics of the presidential race and debate performances rather than on the author's stance on affirmative action or any other issue.	"Summary:
The text is an analysis of the 2004 U.S. presidential race, framing it as a contest between those who love President George W. Bush and those who hate him. It suggests that while John Kerry has not been embraced enthusiastically, he has shown strength in debates, offering clear policy contrasts with Bush. The final debate focused on divisive issues, including abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, faith, taxes, health care, and education. The article notes that Bush had to defend his record during a time of war and economic difficulty, while Kerry aimed to appeal to undecided voters, particularly women. Both candidates had rehearsed lines that did not have a significant impact. The article concludes that presidential debates are important but not the sole factor in winning an election, and that incumbents who do not perform well in debates often do not fare well in elections.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action but indicates that it was one of the key issues in the final presidential debate, suggesting it is a significant and contentious topic in American politics. The debate highlighted the clear differences between Bush and Kerry on various social issues, including affirmative action, but the author does not delve into the specifics of each candidate's stance or provide their own opinion on the matter."	0.02867	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author's description of student activities mocking political correctness, including affirmative action, and the suggestion that ignoring offensive behavior is a powerful response, indicate a critical stance towards affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is a form of discrimination and is part of the 'purported silliness' being satirized by the students. This criticism, alongside the view that political correctness is overzealous, suggests that the author is at least somewhat against affirmative action, as they see it as a flawed policy worthy of critique.	"Summary:
The text discusses a trend at Columbia College Chicago and other universities where students are engaging in activities that mock political correctness, such as an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale"" where pricing is based on race, and a ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant"" game. These activities are intended to satirize what the students see as excessive political correctness on college campuses. The author acknowledges that while such actions are legal in the United States, they can be hurtful, as demonstrated by the incident involving Don Imus and the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The author suggests that ignoring such offensive behavior is a powerful response, rather than the typical reaction of forming committees and drafting policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least in the form it is being lampooned by the students. By describing the ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale"" as a way to confront the ""purported silliness"" of discriminating based on race, the author implies that affirmative action is a form of discrimination that is silly or unjustified. The tone of the text suggests that the author views political correctness, which often includes support for affirmative action, as an overzealous and restrictive ideology that stifles honest critique and judgment. The author's perspective seems to align with the view that affirmative action is a contentious and potentially flawed policy that deserves scrutiny and can be validly criticized."	0.02229	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author, Charles Krauthammer, does not provide a clear and direct opinion on affirmative action in the text provided. The summary indicates that he mentions Barack Obama's comments on affirmative action, specifically the idea of moving from race-based to class-based preferences, as a point of potential debate and shift in consensus. However, Krauthammer does not explicitly endorse or oppose affirmative action, nor does he delve into his personal views on the subject. Therefore, based on the summary, we can categorize his stance as 'neutral' due to the lack of clear support or opposition expressed in the text.	"Summary:
Charles Krauthammer's column discusses the protracted nature of American presidential campaigns, which can last up to two years, in contrast to the much shorter campaign periods in countries like Britain and Canada. He identifies three key functions of these ""endless campaigns"": testing organizational skills, building party consensus and democratic legitimacy, and satisfying the American preference for egalitarianism by subjecting candidates to a grueling and humbling process. Krauthammer notes that while the campaigns can be exhausting and filled with trivialities, they occasionally lead to important debates and shifts in national consensus, as illustrated by Barack Obama's comments on affirmative action and Rudy Giuliani's struggle with the abortion issue. He also points out that the ordeal of campaigning serves as a prelude to the power and prestige that come with the presidency. Despite his personal frustration with the endless campaign cycle as a columnist, Krauthammer acknowledges its critical purposes, particularly the ""gratuitous humiliation"" of presidential candidates, which he finds satisfying.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Charles Krauthammer hints at his perspective on affirmative action through the mention of Barack Obama's suggestion to move away from race-based preferences to class-based preferences. While Krauthammer does not explicitly state his own view, he presents Obama's suggestion as potentially sparking a ""historic debate within the Democratic Party"" and leading to a ""new national consensus."" This suggests that Krauthammer sees value in reevaluating affirmative action policies and is interested in the possibility of a shift in approach, although he does not elaborate on his personal stance on the matter."	0.027859999999999996	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the presence of affirmative action in Lewis Hamilton's career but emphasizes that his success is primarily attributed to his own talent and accomplishments. The reference to affirmative action is minimal and described as 'a touch,' indicating that while the author sees it as a factor, it is not the main reason for Hamilton's success. The author's perspective seems to view affirmative action as a positive but minor element in this context, suggesting a belief that it can contribute to fairness in competitive environments while still maintaining that individual merit is paramount.	"Summary:
Lewis Hamilton, at 22 years old, has made an impressive start to his Formula One career, achieving record-breaking results for a rookie. He has already secured a third-place finish in Australia and a second-place finish in Malaysia. Hamilton's skillful driving has placed him in third in the world championship standings, with only his teammate, two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, ahead. Hamilton's rise in F1 has been supported by a developmental contract with McLaren's Ron Dennis and Mercedes-Benz's Norbert Haug since he was a teenager. His opportunity in F1 was partly enabled by Juan Pablo Montoya's departure to NASCAR, which left an open seat at McLaren that Hamilton has taken advantage of. The author notes that Hamilton's success story includes a small element of affirmative action but emphasizes that his talent and achievements are mostly self-driven.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges that Lewis Hamilton's story includes ""but a touch of affirmative action,"" suggesting that while Hamilton has had some opportunities that may be attributed to initiatives aimed at increasing diversity, his success is largely due to his own merit and talent. The author views affirmative action positively, as a means of ensuring fairness in the highly competitive and costly world of international formula racing. The author also implies that affirmative action has played only a minor role in Hamilton's ascent and that his skills, hard work, and the early support of influential figures in the racing industry have been the primary drivers of his success."	0.026449999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, and there is limited information provided to determine a clear stance. The mention of affirmative action is used as an example within a broader narrative criticizing political hypocrisy and manipulation. The author's criticism of political figures for their handling of affirmative action contracts suggests a negative view of how affirmative action is implemented rather than a condemnation of the policy itself. Therefore, based on the limited context, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action definitively. However, the critical context in which affirmative action is mentioned might imply a somewhat negative view towards its execution.	"Summary:
The author criticizes President Obama for a gaffe he made on ""The Tonight Show,"" where he compared his bowling skills to someone in the Special Olympics. However, the author suggests that Obama's status as a Democrat beloved by the media will likely allow him to move past the incident without significant damage to his reputation. More importantly, the author highlights Obama's surprise at AIG executives receiving $165 million in bonuses as a more significant error. Despite Obama's claimed astonishment, it is revealed that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was aware of the bonuses well in advance. The author likens the political maneuvers in Washington to the “Chicago Way,” implying cronyism and corruption, and criticizes the Democrats for their faux outrage over AIG bonuses. The author also points out the hypocrisy of politicians like Nancy Pelosi, and suggests that the outcry over the bonuses is a political strategy to cover themselves before the 2010 elections. The text ends with the author expressing disbelief at the situation, using the word ""stunned"" sarcastically.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions affirmative action in a critical context, using it as an example of political hypocrisy and manipulation. The author recounts how Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago was ""stunned"" to learn that $100 million in affirmative action contracts went to white males rather than black females, despite being well-acquainted with the men who received the contracts. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as a policy that can be exploited for political gain and can fail to serve its intended purpose due to corruption and cronyism. The author does not provide a detailed analysis of affirmative action as a policy but uses it to illustrate the broader theme of political dishonesty and insincerity."	0.03101	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the importance and effectiveness of affirmative action-like initiatives in diversifying board membership of nonprofit organizations. The text indicates an understanding that without such efforts, qualified minority candidates may continue to be excluded from these positions. The author is aware of the challenges faced by affirmative action programs, such as potential tokenism and financial requirements, but still seems to support the need for these initiatives to foster diversity. The perspective is not purely idealistic but rather practical, understanding the necessity while also recognizing the complexities involved.	"Summary:
Phyllis Lockett, an African-American woman with impressive credentials, was recruited to join the board of a major cultural institution in Chicago, highlighting an effort to diversify board membership in the city's nonprofits. Despite her qualifications, her race and gender were considered key factors in her selection. A program called IMPACT, funded by the Joyce Foundation, Boeing Co., and The Chicago Community Trust, spent $400,000 over three years to place nine qualified minorities on the boards of large nonprofits, aiming to expand the pool of candidates beyond the usual, predominantly white male network. The program faced challenges, such as convincing institutions to join, dealing with the recession, and ensuring that new board members met giving requirements without being seen as tokens. Charles Tribbett III, a black executive recruiter, helped pro bono with the project, emphasizing the need for a new generation of minority leaders on boards.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text seems to recognize the necessity of affirmative action-like initiatives to address the lack of diversity on nonprofit boards in Chicago. The text reflects an understanding that traditional networks tend to exclude qualified minority candidates and that proactive measures are required to ensure representation. The author acknowledges the complexities and potential pitfalls of such programs, including the risk of tokenism and the enforcement of giving standards that might disproportionately affect minority members. However, the author also implies that these initiatives are essential for creating more inclusive and diverse leadership within influential organizations. The perspective is pragmatic about the need for affirmative action while being cognizant of the challenges in its implementation."	0.0275	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text emphasizes the complexity of Martin Luther King Jr.'s views and criticizes the misuse of King's words in contemporary debates on affirmative action, such as California's Proposition 209. The author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action but shows concern for historical accuracy and the dangers of ideological revisionism. The focus on King's nuanced perspective and the caution against using his legacy to support current political agendas suggest that the author is more interested in historical integrity than taking a clear stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., particularly focusing on his book ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"" which outlines his practical solutions for the problems of his time. The author cautions against misusing King's words for contemporary political debates, as was done with California's Proposition 209 on affirmative action. King's stances are described as complex, with elements that both liberals and conservatives could support or criticize. His views on various issues such as the black family crisis, educational neglect, political apathy, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare are summarized. King is characterized as an idealist with pragmatic solutions, though some of his proposals may now seem outdated or have been tried and failed. Despite this, the author argues that King's vision remains more compelling than the leadership offered by current politicians and community leaders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges that Martin Luther King Jr. made some remarks on what is known today as affirmative action, although these were few and the concept was still in its infancy during the 1960s. The author criticizes both proponents and opponents of Proposition 209 for exploiting and distorting King's words on affirmative action, labeling this misuse as ""dangerous ideological revisionism."" This suggests that the author is cautious about attributing a definitive stance on affirmative action to King, given the historical context and the evolution of the concept after King's time. The author seems to advocate for a careful and nuanced understanding of King's views, rather than using them to serve contemporary political agendas."	0.02922	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is presented in a critical context, but the criticism appears to be directed more towards the political manipulation of the issue rather than the policy itself. By including affirmative action in a list of groups and policies that have historically been used as wedge issues in California politics, the author seems to be commenting on the divisive use of the policy in political campaigns rather than taking a definitive stance on the policy's merits or demerits. The author's primary focus is on the pattern of divisive politics, not on affirmative action as an isolated subject. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action itself is not clearly articulated, and the text suggests a broader critique of political tactics rather than the policy.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the recurring themes and issues that define California, emphasizing the state's volatility and the cyclical nature of its challenges. It mentions the constant struggle over water resources, particularly the ongoing disputes regarding the Colorado River. The political landscape is also portrayed as repetitive, with campaigns historically targeting various groups as the ""Other,"" including Chinese laborers, Mexican field workers, and beneficiaries of affirmative action. The author predicts that the future will likely hold more of the same: water wars, political wedge issues, and the enduring presence of certain personalities in the state's public life.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, suggesting it's part of a historical pattern where California politics focuses on divisive issues and targets specific groups. Affirmative action is listed among other scapegoated groups and policies, implying that it is used as a political tool to rally voters by creating an ""us versus them"" dynamic. This perspective is conveyed through a broader commentary on the repetitive and often cynical nature of California's political and social issues."	0.024550000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not directly express a clear stance on affirmative action but rather discusses it in the context of political rhetoric used by conservatives to explain American anxiety in the past. The author suggests that with the resurgence of optimism in the late 1990s, the public is less receptive to arguments against affirmative action as part of a broader conservative critique of social policies. Since the author's focus is on the overall mood of the country and the importance of using prosperity to invest in future challenges, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the central concern of the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the resurgence of American optimism in the late 1990s after a prolonged period of pessimism about the country's direction. The author notes that this renewed optimism is reflected in various surveys and indicators, such as high consumer confidence, President Clinton's approval ratings, and a general sense of contentment among Americans. This positive outlook is attributed to a strong economy, low unemployment, a shrinking federal budget deficit, and declining crime rates. Additionally, the United States is perceived as a leader in shaping the future through its influence in technology and culture, as seen in places like Seattle, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it was one of the issues that conservatives used to explain American anxiety. They blamed it, along with other factors like big government, welfare, and immigration, for the country's problems. However, in the current climate of optimism, the author suggests that the public is less receptive to such arguments. The politics of fear and hostility are less effective when people are feeling positive about their lives and the country's direction. The text implies that in times of optimism, there is less demand for ideological battles and more interest in incremental progress and political compromise.

The author cautions against complacency, noting that despite the good times, the U.S. still faces significant challenges such as underperforming schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, and issues in inner cities. The author encourages leaders to use the period of prosperity to invest in the country's future and address these problems, rather than simply enjoying the positive mood of the moment. The text concludes by underscoring the importance of not becoming complacent, as both pessimism and complacency can be harmful to a nation."	0.03242	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text seems to view affirmative action as a crucial tool in the fight against racial inequalities and discrimination. By emphasizing the need for concrete actions over mere dialogue and advocating for the enforcement of civil rights laws, the author indicates a belief that such measures are necessary for achieving fairness and equal opportunities. The reference to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent, which acknowledges ongoing racial inequalities, further suggests that the author sees affirmative action as a response to these systemic issues. The author's support for increased funding for civil rights enforcement bodies also implies a proactive stance in favor of policies that promote equality.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of enforcing civil rights laws to ensure equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. It highlights a proposal by the Clinton administration to increase civil rights enforcement funding by 17%, which would help address issues such as employment discrimination, housing bias, and inequalities in other areas. The proposal aims to strengthen the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by reducing its case backlog and promoting mediation. It also seeks to enhance the Justice Department's civil rights division and the Housing and Urban Development Department's ability to uncover housing discrimination through increased funding. The author emphasizes that while dialogue on race is important, concrete actions, such as strict enforcement of laws, are necessary to provide fairness and equal opportunities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a means to address persistent racial barriers and discrimination. The author references Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent in a 1995 decision, which eloquently describes the ongoing racial inequalities in various sectors of society. The author questions the logic of opponents of affirmative action who claim to support equal opportunity, yet may reject the enforcement of laws that promote equality. The perspective conveyed is that affirmative action and similar measures are necessary to ensure that decisions made by employers, contractors, mortgage lenders, and landlords are impartial and that the consequences for failure to comply with these measures are swift and certain. The author underscores the need for not just dialogue, but also decisive action to enforce civil rights laws and give everyone a fair chance."	0.02306	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's discussion of affirmative action is limited to its role as a political issue within the context of the California gubernatorial race. The mention of affirmative action is used to illustrate the potential political challenges faced by a candidate, rather than to express a personal stance on the policy itself. The author's main focus is on the candidates' desire to succeed and the dynamics of the political race, not on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the importance of having a strong desire to succeed, likening the selection of political candidates to choosing eager players in a childhood game. The author discusses the California gubernatorial race, where three potential candidates with ""star"" qualities declined to run, leaving four others who demonstrated the necessary ""fire in the belly"" to compete. The author briefly evaluates the reasons why the potential candidates chose not to run and asserts that the remaining candidates are capable and determined. The text also touches on the political positioning and strategies of the candidates, as well as the dynamics of the open primary system in California.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text; however, it is mentioned in a political context. The author notes that Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a potential Republican candidate, did not support anti-affirmative action initiatives, which could have made him a target for criticism within his party. This suggests that affirmative action was a contentious issue among Republicans, and Riordan's stance on it might have weakened his appeal to the party's base. The author does not explicitly express a personal opinion on affirmative action but uses it as an example of a political stance that could influence the success of a candidate in a primary election."	0.02568	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author, Herschel Rosenthal, does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action. Instead, he discusses the broader context of how the lack of personal relationships and increased partisanship in the California state Legislature has affected the handling of sensitive issues, including affirmative action. He implies that the quality of debate and policymaking on such issues could be improved with better interpersonal relationships among legislators, but he does not offer a specific stance on affirmative action itself. Therefore, we cannot accurately categorize his stance on affirmative action based on the information provided.	"Summary:
Herschel Rosenthal, a retiring state legislator with 24 years of experience, reflects on the changes he has witnessed in the California state Capitol. He notes the increased public involvement in state policy, largely due to the internet and cable television, and the improved diversity within the Legislature itself. However, he laments the decline in personal relationships among legislators, which he believes used to facilitate more respectful and effective policymaking. Rosenthal observes that the lack of social interaction and the rise in partisanship have led to a more hostile and less productive legislative environment. He attributes this change to several factors, including the coarsening of public discourse, term limits, and competitive districts. He specifically mentions that this deterioration of relationships has negatively impacted the way legislators handle sensitive issues, such as affirmative action, bilingual education, and illegal immigration, often leading to debates lacking in sensitivity or understanding. Rosenthal concludes by emphasizing the importance of legislators taking time to build personal relationships to foster harmony and better address the complexities of governing a diverse state like California.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Herschel Rosenthal, views affirmative action as a contentious and sensitive issue that has been negatively affected by the decline in personal relationships among legislators. He suggests that the lack of understanding and sensitivity in debates over affirmative action and other related issues is a result of the increased partisanship and the erosion of interpersonal connections within the Legislature. Rosenthal's perspective implies that a more collegial and interconnected legislative body would be better equipped to handle debates on affirmative action with the necessary respect and comprehension of the issue's complexities and implications for different cultural and racial groups."	0.02596	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author, Jose Novoa, is critical of affirmative action's scope, pointing out that it benefits primarily the middle-class people of color and does not sufficiently address the economic challenges faced by the working and poverty classes. He believes that affirmative action has not tackled the deeper, structural economic issues that perpetuate racial inequality. While Novoa acknowledges the positive aspects of affirmative action in fighting bigotry and racial discrimination, he advocates for a more comprehensive approach that includes race and class analyses. His perspective is not against the concept of affirmative action itself but rather against its limited effectiveness and the lack of broader measures to combat racism and economic disparities.	"Summary:
Jose Novoa, a doctoral student in ethnic studies, critiques President Bill Clinton's race-dialogue initiative for its narrow focus on race without considering class issues. Novoa acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action but argues that it has primarily helped middle-class people of color while doing little for the working and poverty classes. He recounts the evolution of the term ""black power"" from a political concept to one associated with black capitalism, which was endorsed by corporate and government leaders, including President Nixon. Novoa suggests that a more comprehensive approach to combating racism should address the different experiences of racism across economic classes and include strategies such as equalizing school funding, closing legal loopholes, and creating broad-based employment opportunities. He emphasizes the need for legal and structural changes over new dialogues about race relations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges the positive impact of affirmative action in creating opportunities for people of color in professional fields. However, he criticizes affirmative action for not sufficiently addressing the economic challenges faced by poor people of color. Novoa views affirmative action as a measure that has benefitted the middle and upper classes within communities of color but has acted as a tokenistic solution that fails to tackle the deeper, structural economic issues that perpetuate racial inequality. He suggests that while affirmative action has its place in fighting against bigotry and racial discrimination, it should not be seen as a substitute for more direct measures that address the effects of racism on economically disadvantaged people of color. Novoa argues for a broader strategy that combines race and class analyses to effectively fight racism and improve the lives of all people of color, particularly those in poverty."	0.0334	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the political rise of Latino leaders in the Republican Party and mentions affirmative action in the context of the party's past positions and efforts to improve its image among Latino voters. The author mentions that Pacheco supported Proposition 209, which ended state racial preferences, aligning with the GOP's traditional stance against affirmative action. However, the text does not provide enough information to determine the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as the author seems to be reporting on the political dynamics and changes within the Republican Party rather than expressing a personal viewpoint on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the rise of Latino leaders in California's political landscape, emphasizing the recent election of Rod Pacheco as the first Latino Republican leader in the Assembly. Pacheco's election, along with the victories of three other GOP Latinos, is seen as a sign of growing Latino political influence. The Republican Party is aiming to recover from a difficult election and improve its relationship with Latino voters, who have been alienated by the party's past positions on issues like affirmative action and illegal immigration. Pacheco, a former prosecutor, is a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187 (an anti-illegal immigration initiative), but he supported Proposition 209, which ended state racial preferences. Although there is speculation about his potential for statewide office, Pacheco is cautious about such predictions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is indirectly conveyed through the context of Republican efforts to distance themselves from past actions that were perceived as hostile to Latinos. The GOP is trying to overcome the negative image created by former Governor Pete Wilson's campaigns against affirmative action and illegal immigration. Pacheco, despite being a Republican, represents a more moderate stance within his party. He supported Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in state government, indicating his agreement with the GOP's traditional stance on the issue. However, the author suggests that the Republican Party is seeking to present a more inclusive image, with Pacheco and other Latino leaders potentially playing a role in this transformation. The text implies that while the GOP has historically been against affirmative action, there is a recognition that the party must evolve to appeal to a broader and more diverse electorate, including Latinos who may share some conservative values but have felt alienated by the party's previous positions on racial issues."	0.03046	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt	2
	None	The author does not provide a personal opinion on affirmative action but instead discusses it in a historical and political context, noting that it was once a significant issue that has since lost urgency among voters after the passage of Proposition 209. The focus of the text is on the changing priorities of the electorate and political issues over time, rather than on the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses how education has been a key issue for California politicians, with Governor Gray Davis focusing on school reform. However, pollster Steve Kinney suggests that education as a voter motivator may decline as politicians appear to have addressed the problem, potentially leading to voter complacency. Kinney predicts that by the 2002 election, infrastructure and health care will become the top concerns, especially if the economy continues to boom. He bases his predictions on the intensity of voters' concerns, measuring how personally important issues are to them. Kinney's polling indicated education was still the top concern at the end of 1998, but health care was gaining importance. While Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, agrees with the trend, he believes education will remain a significant issue for a couple more years. The text also mentions that Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and Senate leader John Burton are addressing health care and transportation issues, respectively, suggesting that these areas may become more prominent in political discussions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss their personal perspective on affirmative action; however, they mention it in the context of political issues that have lost their urgency among voters. The author notes that affirmative action, along with illegal immigration and crime, was a hot topic that cooled down after the passage of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in public institutions in California. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as an issue that can generate significant attention and political action for a period, but may not maintain its intensity as a public concern over time. The author's focus is more on the shifting priorities of the electorate and the political response to those changes rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.02849	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in terms of support or opposition to the policy in general. The text does not provide a clear stance on the principles or implementation of affirmative action in society or institutions. Instead, the author focuses on Jim Brulte's actions within the political realm, where he supports the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This indicates that while Brulte may not publicly debate affirmative action, he practices a form of it within his capacity as a political leader. The author's discussion on this matter is purely descriptive and does not advocate for or against affirmative action, which suggests a neutral stance on the policy itself. The author seems more interested in discussing Brulte's political strategies and impact on the Republican Party rather than engaging in the broader affirmative action debate.	"Summary:
The text discusses the state of the California Republican Party, highlighting its lack of prominent leaders and the challenges it faces in competing with the Democratic Party, which holds the governorship, both U.S. Senate seats, and the majority of statewide partisan offices. The piece focuses on Jim Brulte, the new state Senate minority leader, who is described as politically savvy, articulate, and respected across party lines. Brulte's political career includes working for Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and he has a reputation for political strategy and legislative compromise. He emphasizes unity over divisive issues and has financially supported Republican women and minorities' campaigns. The author notes Brulte's optimism about the GOP's future in California and his role in improving the party's financial standing. Brulte is also seen as the point man for George W. Bush in California and has helped raise significant funds for the party.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author describes Brulte as avoiding divisive issues, including affirmative action. However, it is mentioned that Brulte has his own affirmative action program, which involves investing money from his political funds into the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This suggests that while Brulte may not engage in the broader public debate on affirmative action, he sees value in actively supporting diverse candidates within his party. The author's perspective seems to acknowledge this approach as a strategic move to broaden the party's appeal and suggests that Brulte is attempting to change the perception of the Republican Party as intolerant by promoting inclusivity through his support of diverse candidates."	0.02976	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's mention of affirmative action is embedded in a broader critique of Governor Davis's shift away from centrist policies. The mention of affirmative action is brief and primarily serves to illustrate the author's point about the Governor's political leanings. The author seems to view affirmative action as a tool used by the Governor to appease certain political allies, suggesting a critical stance on the policy. However, since the focus of the text is not on affirmative action itself, but rather on the Governor's overall political actions, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the main subject of the text. Therefore, there is not enough information to conclusively determine the author's full perspective on affirmative action. They are critical in the context of Governor Davis's actions but do not provide a detailed argument or position on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The author critiques California Governor Gray Davis for his decision to sign a bill requiring overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, which positions California alongside Alaska as the only states with such a regulation. This move is seen as a deviation from Davis’s centrist image and a concession to the liberal legislature and interest groups that supported his campaign. The author argues that this policy will reduce flexibility for workers and businesses and could harm California's business climate. Despite Davis's attempts to appear moderate, his actions, including appointments from union, environmental, and trial lawyer backgrounds and the reinstatement of a form of affirmative action at the University of California, suggest a leftward shift. The author acknowledges that Davis is not an extreme liberal but implies that his administration is influenced by groups favoring regulatory expansion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of Governor Davis's actions. The author mentions that Davis orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of affirmative action at the University of California, which is presented as part of a pattern of governance that leans more towards the interests of his political allies than the centrist approach he promised. The author's choice of words, such as ""orchestrated,"" suggests a view that affirmative action is part of a political maneuver rather than a policy motivated by equity or social justice. This perspective aligns with the overall critical tone of the text, implying that such policies are a departure from moderate governance and a nod to special interest groups."	0.02767	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. While they initially defend the program based on past advocacy and its benefits to minority students, they also recognize that individuals from privileged backgrounds, such as their son, may not need affirmative action. The author suggests that affirmative action should be refined to target those who face actual social disadvantages, rather than being applied broadly based on race. This indicates a belief in the necessity of the program but also a desire for its reform to make it more effective and fair.	"Summary:
The essay written by the author's son, Miguel, challenges the necessity of affirmative action, despite being a Latino student who could benefit from it. Miguel believes the program should be abolished, viewing it as unfair, outdated, and a form of reverse racism. The author, a proponent of affirmative action and a UC Berkeley graduate, initially feels outraged by his son's stance. However, upon reflection, the author acknowledges that his son, with his advantageous upbringing, might not need affirmative action himself. Still, the author disagrees with the idea of abolishing the program, considering the less privileged students who still face social disadvantages. The author notes that while racial disparities persist, affirmative action policies can be more targeted to assist students who truly need help. The author mentions a new plan that broadens UC eligibility and outreach programs that have successfully boosted SAT scores for disadvantaged students. The essay concludes with Miguel revising his stance, suggesting that equal opportunity should be provided to all who work hard and pursue success.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. While initially defensive of the program due to his advocacy in his youth and the benefits it provided to minority students at UC Berkeley, he recognizes that his son's privileged background diminishes the need for affirmative action in his specific case. The author believes that the program should not be completely discarded but rather refined to target students from underprivileged backgrounds who face real social disadvantages. The author supports policies that consider success in the face of adversity, which may correlate with race but are based on the reality of differing circumstances. Ultimately, the author seems to advocate for a more selective and circumstance-based approach to affirmative action, rather than a broad race-based policy, to ensure that it serves those who need it most."	0.02917	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Halford H. Fairchild, demonstrates a perspective that is critical of the current implementation of affirmative action insofar as it relies on standardized tests like the SAT. His criticism is not of the principle of affirmative action itself, but rather of the mechanisms, such as the SAT, that are used to facilitate it, which he argues perpetuate inequality. Fairchild advocates for a more equitable approach to admissions that would truly benefit underrepresented minorities by focusing on attributes that reflect a student's potential for success beyond biased metrics. His stance indicates a desire to reform affirmative action to make it more effective in achieving its intended goals of equality and inclusivity in higher education.	"Summary:
Halford H. Fairchild, a professor at Pitzer College, criticizes the reliance on the SAT for university admissions, arguing that it perpetuates racial, economic, and cultural inequalities. He notes that the SAT does not accurately measure a student's potential for success in college, as it does not tap into crucial attributes like motivation and effort. Fairchild also criticizes standardized tests like the SAT II and professional exams (MCAT, LSAT, GRE) for not accounting for the varied educational experiences of students. He points out the disproportionate impact on minority students who have less access to resources like advanced placement courses. Fairchild advocates for admissions criteria that emphasize critical thinking and intercultural awareness over biased metrics like the SAT. He suggests reallocating funds spent on exclusionary practices to expanding educational opportunities and notes that the debate over the SAT's merits is ongoing at his institution.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Halford H. Fairchild, expresses a critical view of affirmative action as it is currently implemented, particularly in the context of standardized testing like the SAT. He believes that the use of the SAT as a key admissions criterion inherently supports a system that favors affluent white students and maintains racial and economic disparities. Fairchild suggests that affirmative action should not be about maintaining the status quo through proxies like the SAT, which he views as discriminatory. Instead, he advocates for a reimagined approach to admissions that would genuinely address and mitigate the biases and barriers faced by underrepresented minorities. This would involve valuing attributes such as drive, determination, critical thinking, and intercultural competence over traditional measures of ""merit"" that are flawed and biased. His perspective suggests a commitment to equity and inclusivity in higher education, with a focus on transformative policies that go beyond superficial measures of diversity."	0.02999	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author reflects on the history of African American Republicans' contributions to civil rights and the development of affirmative action, particularly mentioning the Philadelphia Plan, which implies a recognition of the value of affirmative action policies. While the author does not explicitly state their current stance on affirmative action, the positive acknowledgment of its historical significance suggests a favorable view, albeit without strong advocacy or opposition in the present context. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action can be categorized as 'somewhat in favor' based on the appreciation for past contributions to affirmative action by black Republicans.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the challenges of being a black Republican, citing personal experiences and observations. Growing up in a black Republican family, the author recounts an incident where their family was harassed on the way to the 1964 GOP convention, where the author's father gave a speech. The author's father believed in self-reliance and the importance of black participation in both political parties. The author notes that in the past, African American Republicans like Art Fletcher made significant contributions to civil rights and the development of affirmative action through initiatives like the Philadelphia Plan. However, the author perceives that the motivations of contemporary black Republicans may differ, with some seeking to be provocative or taking advantage of less competition within the party. The author, once a black Republican, eventually shifted political views and became a Democrat, feeling disconnected from the new generation of black Republicans and their values.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, as they discuss the Philadelphia Plan's role in increasing job opportunities for minorities and women, an initiative that was supported by African American Republicans of the past, including Art Fletcher. The author seems to appreciate the legacy of civil rights activism within the Republican Party that contributed to affirmative action efforts. However, there is no explicit critique or endorsement of affirmative action in the present context; the focus is more on the evolution of black Republicanism and the personal journey of the author within the political landscape."	0.024939999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Felicia Clark, demonstrates concern for the impact of the new census categories on affirmative action. Her criticism of the fragmentation of ethnic groups indicates a belief that this could weaken the political power and effectiveness of race-based programs designed to address historical injustices. Clark's argument that socio-economic factors might be more relevant than race for political and economic forecasting suggests a nuanced perspective on how to achieve equity. However, her call for a return to traditional race categories until a better justification for the new ones is provided implies a defense of affirmative action policies as they currently stand. Therefore, she seems somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as she supports its goals but is critical of current methodologies that could impede its effectiveness.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark, an educator with the Compton Unified School District, criticizes the new 57 multiethnic categories recognized in the 2000 U.S. census. She argues that the complexity of these categories hinders efforts to address historical racial injustices. Clark suggests that the data collected is invalid and serves conservative political interests rather than promoting cultural pluralism. She views the new census categories as a strategy to dilute the political power of ethnic communities by dividing them into numerous subgroups, particularly affecting those of darker skin tones. Clark also questions the criteria for racial categorization, sharing her personal dilemma with the census's multiethnic options. She proposes that socio-economic factors might be more relevant for modern political and economic forecasting than race. Clark calls for a return to traditional race categories until the government can justify the need for the 57 new categories.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Felicia Clark, appears to be critical of the way the new census categories impact affirmative action and other race-based programs. She believes that the confusing and potentially invalid data resulting from the 57 multiethnic categories make it difficult to monitor, legislate, and interpret affirmative action policies. Clark implies that the new census approach undermines the effectiveness of such programs by fragmenting ethnic communities into smaller, less powerful voting blocs, which could be seen as a tactic by those who oppose reparations and race-based interventions. Her stance suggests that she values affirmative action as a means to rectify historical injustices and sees the new census categories as a barrier to achieving those goals."	0.02462	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	2
0	strongly_against	The author, Edwin A. Locke, expresses criticism towards the move away from objective academic qualifications in university admissions in favor of subjective criteria, which he believes could reintroduce race as a factor despite official disclaimers. Locke sees standardized testing as a fair tool that is blind to personal characteristics and views the new policies as a means to undermine fairness and objectivity. He is concerned that academically qualified students will be disadvantaged and suggests that the underlying motive is an egalitarian approach that disregards differences in academic competence. His perspective indicates a clear opposition to the subjective elements often associated with affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The University of California Board of Regents has introduced new admissions policies that de-emphasize academic qualifications and consider other factors like athletic or artistic talents and overcoming poverty. The policies aim to move away from standardized testing and grades, traditionally used as main criteria for college admissions due to their predictive value for academic performance. The author argues that the changes will introduce subjectivity into the admissions process, allowing for hidden agendas and the potential return of race as a factor, despite official disclaimers. The author also questions the inclusion of non-academic criteria such as athletic ability and overcoming adversity. They suggest that the new guidelines will disadvantage academically qualified students and are rooted in an egalitarian motive to disregard differences in academic competence.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Edwin A. Locke, is critical of affirmative action and the move towards subjective admissions criteria. He sees the changes as a way to undermine the concepts of fairness and objectivity. Locke believes that standardized tests like the SAT are objective and blind to personal characteristics, making them fair tools for college admissions. He is skeptical of the claim that race will not factor into admissions decisions and views the regents' vote to drop a ban on affirmative action as a clear message. Locke argues that the new policies will protect the university from discrimination lawsuits by making admissions criteria so subjective that academically qualified students will have no legal recourse if rejected. He perceives the real motive behind the changes as a form of egalitarianism that refuses to acknowledge that some students are more academically qualified than others, and he warns that this will ultimately harm both students and universities."	0.02624	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on Chief Justice Rehnquist's tenure and his influence on the Supreme Court, mentioning that his opinions often lacked clear guiding principles, which resulted in uncertainties in areas like affirmative action. However, the author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action itself, but rather comments on the unpredictability of the Court's decisions in this area under Rehnquist. The author's main concern seems to be with the lack of clear judicial philosophy rather than with the merits or demerits of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the influence of various chief justices on the U.S. Supreme Court, with a focus on William H. Rehnquist's tenure. John Marshall established judicial review, while Earl Warren advanced racial equality and the rights of criminal defendants. Rehnquist, appointed in 1972, aimed to scale back civil rights expansions, though his record is mixed. He promoted states' rights, limited federal power, and reduced protections for criminal suspects and minorities. Despite his opposition, decisions like Roe vs. Wade remained. Rehnquist's management style was efficient but his opinions often lacked clear guiding principles, leaving uncertainties in areas like affirmative action and terrorism suspect rights. His most controversial ruling was in Bush vs. Gore, which the author views as activist and inconsistent with previous equal protection decisions. Rehnquist's successor could significantly impact the Court's direction, with potential shifts in key precedents like Roe v. Wade.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that under Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action was unclear and unpredictable. Rehnquist's opinions were often narrowly focused on the specific facts of a case rather than establishing broad principles, which left both legal experts and the public guessing about the Court's decisions on affirmative action programs. This implies that the author views Rehnquist's approach to affirmative action, and his judicial philosophy more broadly, as lacking in clear, consistent guidance that could be used to predict or understand the Court's rulings in this area."	0.029099999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	David Gelernter's critical view of affirmative action, as inferred from the summary, suggests that he questions its ongoing necessity and views it as part of a stagnant Democratic agenda. His implication that affirmative action has been in place for a long time and may not be justified in the current context indicates a skepticism towards its continued relevance. His association of affirmative action with resistance to change and progress aligns with a stance that is somewhat against or potentially strongly against the policy.	"Summary:
David Gelernter, a Yale professor and senior fellow at the Shalem Center, criticizes Democratic Senator Charles Schumer for his remarks about the Republican Party wanting to turn back the clock to earlier, less progressive times. Gelernter argues that it is the Democrats who have become the party of reactionary liberalism, resistant to change and progress, while the Republicans are the true progressives seeking justice, democracy, and improvement in various sectors such as education, international relations, and social security. He accuses Democrats of wanting to maintain the status quo, opposing school vouchers, UN reforms, and Social Security adjustments. Gelernter also criticizes the Democrats' use of filibusters to block judicial nominees and their reluctance to let state legislatures decide on abortion policy. He suggests that Democrats are against democracy and prefer judicial over popular decisions on issues like gay marriage. On university campuses, he notes the resistance to questioning the continued necessity of affirmative action. Gelernter concludes that the current political scene, where Republicans are advocating for global and domestic improvements while Democrats are perceived as stagnant, only makes sense when one recognizes the ""Big Switch"" in party roles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, appears to be critical of affirmative action, suggesting that it may have outlived its usefulness. He points out that there are tenured professors who have never experienced a world without affirmative action, implying that it has been in place for a long time and questioning whether racism, sexism, and classism still justify its existence. Gelernter's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is part of the Democrats' adherence to the status quo and their reluctance to allow any changes or challenges to long-standing policies, even when such policies might warrant reevaluation."	0.02773	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author is critical of affirmative action, emphasizing its negative effects such as stigmatization of individuals' achievements and perpetuating stereotypes. They also point out the hypocrisy in liberal critics' support for affirmative action while disparaging Clarence Thomas as an 'affirmative action hire.' The author seems to believe that affirmative action can undermine meritocracy and reduce individuals to their race, rather than acknowledging their personal accomplishments.	"Summary:
The text discusses the criticism Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced since his nomination and confirmation, focusing particularly on accusations that he was an ""affirmative action hire."" Critics, including liberal columnists Eugene Robinson and Anna Quindlen, have suggested that Thomas's qualifications were lacking and that his appointment was primarily due to his race. The text argues that such criticisms are hypocritical, as they come from supporters of affirmative action who simultaneously disparage Thomas, a supposed beneficiary of the policy. The author highlights the inconsistency in liberals attacking Thomas for his opposition to affirmative action when he himself has experienced its stigmatizing effects, as described in his memoir ""My Grandfather's Son."" The author also reflects on the broader implications of affirmative action, suggesting it can undermine the perceived legitimacy of the professional achievements of black Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, particularly its application and the consequences it has for individuals like Justice Clarence Thomas. They argue that affirmative action can lead to the stigmatization of the achievements of its beneficiaries, as it casts a shadow of doubt over whether their success is due to merit or racial preference. The author also points out the hypocrisy of liberals who support affirmative action but criticize Thomas as being unqualified and accuse him of hypocrisy for opposing it, despite benefiting from it in the past. Furthermore, the author suggests that affirmative action can demean individuals by reducing them to their immutable traits rather than considering their individual merits. The text implies that affirmative action is a flawed system that unfairly privileges some over others based on skin color and that it can perpetuate negative stereotypes rather than fostering genuine equality."	0.02818	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The text provides a summary of perspectives from different individuals during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Sonia Sotomayor. The author's own perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated; instead, the author reports the views of others. Erwin Chemerinsky and Ilya Shapiro do not directly address affirmative action, so their stances on the issue are not clear from the text. Kimberly West-Faulcon is the only one who speaks about affirmative action, noting that Republicans used the topic as a political strategy. However, since the author is summarizing the views of others rather than explicitly stating their own, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on this text.	"Summary:
During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination, Republican senators focused on issues of national security, the growing deficit, the right to bear arms, and warned against judicial activism. Legal analysts believed Sotomayor maintained a moderate profile and demonstrated an open mind. 

Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, argued that the hearings allowed senators to address their political bases and the public to hear from Sotomayor but didn't provide a clear indication of how she would perform as a justice. He noted that she seemed to lean more conservative than expected in her remarks, particularly on the use of foreign law and the interpretation of the Constitution.

Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute felt that Sotomayor was evasive in her responses, which diminished his view of her. He expressed frustration that she didn't clearly articulate her stance on the use of foreign law in U.S. cases.

Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, observed that the Republicans were engaging in identity politics by focusing on affirmative action and other issues to appeal to white Americans' fears. She believed that the hearings were less about assessing Sotomayor and more about promoting the senators' ideologies. West-Faulcon concluded that Sotomayor successfully presented herself as a moderate and judicious candidate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text implies that the author, or at least the individuals quoted, have distinct perspectives on affirmative action in the context of the hearings.

Erwin Chemerinsky doesn't directly address affirmative action but suggests that Sotomayor distanced herself from more liberal views during the hearings, possibly to appease conservative concerns, which might encompass affirmative action policies.

Ilya Shapiro's comments do not explicitly discuss affirmative action, but his concerns about Sotomayor's responses could imply skepticism about her positions on policies like affirmative action, which often come under conservative scrutiny.

Kimberly West-Faulcon explicitly discusses affirmative action, indicating that the Republican senators were using the topic as a wedge issue to appeal to certain demographics and to push their own legal philosophies. West-Faulcon's perspective suggests that she views the Republican focus on affirmative action as a political strategy rather than a genuine vetting of Sotomayor's qualifications."	0.03265	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes affirmative action for not effectively addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged within the black community and for exacerbating ethnic and class divisions. They argue that affirmative action benefits a small segment of the black community and suggests that other targeted programs would be more effective in addressing systemic issues. This perspective indicates that the author is critical of affirmative action's effectiveness and its approach to addressing racial inequality, showing a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the incorrect assumption that racial discrimination is the sole cause of race riots, using the Miami riot as a case study. The author argues that while discrimination, particularly by the police, played a role, the underlying issue is more deeply rooted in class conflict. The Miami riot, like others before it, was characterized by destruction and looting of businesses, regardless of ownership. The author points out that the black community is divided by a growing class gap, with an expanding black middle class and a persistently disadvantaged lower class. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 reduced racial discrimination in the labor market, benefiting the black middle class, but has not helped those without the opportunity for higher education. Poor blacks are left competing for low-wage service jobs, with a declining availability of better-paying blue-collar jobs. The author criticizes affirmative action for exacerbating ethnic and class divisions and for not addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged blacks. The text concludes by calling for targeted programs to ensure full employment and welfare reform, and warns that cutting these programs for increased defense spending risks further unrest in urban areas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a well-intentioned but ultimately flawed response to racial inequality. He believes that affirmative action programs create a backlash among ethnic groups and working-class whites, as they use race-conscious criteria. Additionally, the author argues that these programs disproportionately benefit a small segment of the black community—those who are able to attend college and compete for high-paying jobs—while failing to reach the most disadvantaged blacks who are stuck in low-wage jobs and unemployment. The author suggests that affirmative action inadvertently widens the class gap within the black community and does not address the systemic issues that perpetuate poverty and unemployment among the poorest segments of society. Instead, the author advocates for programs that directly target the needs of poor blacks, such as ensuring full employment and reforming the welfare system, to achieve meaningful progress."	0.030170000000000002	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's criticism of Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action, coupled with the concern that Zumbrun is appointed to a position where he would administer laws related to civil rights and legal aid, indicates a defense of affirmative action principles. The author's negative view of Zumbrun's preference for aiding corporations over supporting legal aid for the needy further suggests a stance that is in favor of affirmative action, as it highlights a commitment to aiding the underprivileged, which is a core aspect of affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author likely supports affirmative action and disapproves of those who are against it, especially when they are in positions of influence over related policies.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for what the author perceives as poor choices in appointing Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation and William Bell to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author suggests that these appointments are akin to letting ""foxes guard chickens,"" implying that both individuals are ill-suited for their respective roles. Zumbrun is criticized for his opposition to the very law he would administer and for his preference for aiding corporations over supporting legal aid for the needy. Bell is described as lacking accomplishments in management or civil rights, with his minority recruiting firm having a dubious presence and no known success in the current year. The author views both nominations as insults to the poor, legal profession, and workers of any race or sex, and suggests that the Administration should focus on finding the internal saboteur who is making these decisions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action. Zumbrun's preference for helping corporations that are against government regulation and affirmative action is highlighted as a negative aspect of his potential leadership of the Legal Services Corporation. The author's mention of Zumbrun's stance suggests a defense of affirmative action and a disapproval of those who oppose it, particularly when they are nominated for positions that would require them to oversee areas related to civil rights and legal aid for the underprivileged."	0.02196	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not addressed in the text. The focus of the text is on the financial concerns surrounding the Westway project, and affirmative action is only mentioned in passing as a line item in the project's budget. The author does not provide any opinion or commentary on affirmative action itself, so it is impossible to categorize their stance on it based on the information provided.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece that discusses the author's concerns about the financial aspects of the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. The project's estimated cost has ballooned from $1.4 billion to over $4 billion. The author has acquired a detailed accounting from the State Transportation Department, revealing that $75 million has been spent so far on preliminary planning and construction, with 90% of the funding coming from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and the remaining 10% from the state. The author provides a list of major consultants, engineers, and contractors who have received significant sums for their work on the project. The author expresses opposition to Westway, considering it an unnecessary luxury and a waste of resources in a time of budget constraints, advocating instead for a more modest replacement road and investment in mass transit. The piece also highlights two entities involved in the project that were criticized by a Federal judge for providing ""false responses"" and having ""an intent to misrepresent,"" raising questions about the propriety of their profits from the project.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text, and there is no explicit stance provided on the concept as a whole. However, the author does mention ""affirmative action consultants"" as one of the recipients of the funds for the Westway project, indicating that such services are part of the project's expenses. The inclusion of affirmative action consultants suggests that there is an effort to address diversity and equal opportunity within the project's hiring or contracting practices. The author does not critique this aspect of the spending, and therefore, it can't be inferred that the author is either supportive or critical of affirmative action based on the provided text. The mention is purely factual within the context of the project's expenditures."	0.0306	affirmative action	txt/424505995.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's critique of Morris Abram's neutral stance on affirmative action, along with their invocation of Justice Blackmun and President Johnson's more proactive views, suggests that the author is in favor of a form of affirmative action that actively works to redress past injustices and systemic barriers faced by minorities. The author's use of terms like 'bloodless' and 'uncharacteristically ungenerous' to describe Abram's perspective indicates a disagreement with a merely technical approach to equality and a preference for measures that ensure true equality of opportunity.	"Summary:
The text reflects on a moment when President Lyndon Johnson expressed frustration with being unfavorably compared to John F. Kennedy on civil rights issues, despite his own significant contributions. The focus then shifts to Morris Abram's nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and his stance on affirmative action. Abram, who has fought against bigotry, believes that affirmative action should only be permissible if it is neutral and does not discriminate for or against any individual. He opposes quotas, fearing they could lead to conflicts and a cycle of preferential treatment for various groups. The author argues that while Abram does not oppose remedial action and supports social assistance such as job training, he is reluctant to support measures that would actively open up job opportunities for minorities. The author disagrees with Abram's neutral stance, citing Justice Blackmun's opinion in the Bakke case and President Johnson's speech at Howard University, which both suggest that to achieve true equality, it is necessary to take race into account and treat people differently.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of Morris Abram's technical and neutral perspective on affirmative action. They argue that Abram's view is ""bloodless"" and ""uncharacteristically ungenerous,"" indicating that the author believes affirmative action requires a more compassionate and proactive approach. The author suggests that affirmative action should not be about enforcing quotas but about making institutions accountable and ensuring they make genuine efforts to include minority employees, students, and applicants.

The author also contrasts Abram's perspective with that of Justice Blackmun and President Johnson, who both acknowledged that simply providing equal opportunity is not sufficient to overcome the historical disadvantages faced by minorities. The author seems to support a more active form of affirmative action that takes into account the systemic barriers and provides measures to ensure that minorities have a fair chance to succeed, thus implying a belief that affirmative action should go beyond neutrality to actively redress past injustices."	0.03005	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text summary, as the text does not address affirmative action in the context of U.S. domestic policy or social justice initiatives. Instead, the term 'affirmative' is used in the context of international relations and diplomacy, which is unrelated to the concept of affirmative action as it pertains to efforts to improve opportunities for historically marginalized groups. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not discussed or implied in the summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political climate of the year in the context of U.S.-Soviet relations following the death of Yuri Andropov. The author suggests that the change in Soviet leadership and the upcoming American elections will likely keep relations between the two superpowers strained and hinder the resolution of major issues, particularly arms control. The author advocates for a cautious approach where neither side should challenge the other, and emphasizes the importance of signaling respect for each other's concerns. The text highlights the potential impact of humanitarian gestures, such as the Soviet Union easing up on the repression of dissidents, on Western opinion and the possibilities for negotiation. The author also criticizes President Reagan's harsh rhetoric towards the Soviet Union, suggesting it may be counterproductive, and cites former U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon's view that such rhetoric could make the Soviets believe the U.S. aims for their destruction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of U.S. domestic policy or as a term related to efforts to improve opportunities for historically marginalized groups. Instead, the term ""affirmative"" is used in a different sense, referring to ""affirmative possibilities of signals,"" which means actions that indicate a desire for diplomatic engagement rather than a change in policy. The author's perspective on this form of affirmative action is positive, suggesting that both the U.S. and the Soviet Union could benefit from such diplomatic signals, especially those that show a degree of respect for the other side's concerns."	0.02737	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is positive, as evidenced by their support for the steps taken by Director William Sessions to address discrimination within the FBI. The author's approval of replacing the previous director with an outsider and including minority agents on promotion boards indicates a belief in the need for systemic changes to achieve equality. The emphasis on the FBI's responsibility to enforce civil rights laws and to exemplarily comply with them further underscores the author's stance that affirmative action is necessary to correct institutional discrimination and ensure fair treatment. The author's tone suggests that while they approve of the recent actions, they are also waiting to see the long-term effectiveness of these changes.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of discrimination within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the steps taken by Director William Sessions to address affirmative action within the agency. Sessions acknowledged the failure of the FBI's previous efforts to ensure equal treatment for minority employees. In response, he replaced the director responsible for these efforts with an outsider and included black and Hispanic agents on the bureau's internal promotion boards. These actions follow a federal judge's ruling that found the FBI guilty of discrimination against Hispanic agents and complaints of harassment against a black agent by his white colleagues. The urgency for prompt and effective remedies is highlighted, especially since the FBI is tasked with enforcing civil rights laws and must therefore exemplarily comply with them.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary response to the documented discrimination within the FBI. By emphasizing the need for an external manager and more inclusive promotion boards, the author suggests that systemic changes are required to address the issues of inequality. The mention of the FBI's role in enforcing civil rights laws further implies that the author believes the agency must lead by example in upholding these principles. The tone indicates approval of Director Sessions' recent actions as a step towards improvement, while also suggesting that the effectiveness of these actions remains to be seen. Overall, the author seems to advocate for affirmative action as a tool to correct institutional discrimination and to ensure fair treatment of all employees within the FBI."	0.02028	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt	2
	None	The provided summary does not mention affirmative action or any related topics. The focus is on the Bush Administration's approach to governance, political strategy, and the author's satirical take on the administration's effectiveness. There is no information given that allows for an assessment of the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a satirical commentary on the Bush Administration's perceived lack of urgency and its approach to governance. It opens with a joke about President Bush being knocked out cold for three and a half years, suggesting a metaphor for inaction. Upon waking, he's reassured by Chief of Staff John Sununu that all is well, though there's a hint of American decline with the cost of mailing a letter being 300 yen. The author, during an interview with Sununu, observes his inexperience and attempts to assert control, such as having a deputy take notes and feigning busyness. Sununu introduces the concept of a ""different template"" for the Bush administration, implying a shift from Reagan's style of confrontation to Bush's preference for conciliation. The text touches on political maneuvers such as the deal with Speaker Wright over Nicaragua and the concept of ""enhanced rescission,"" a middle ground between outright spending and the line-item veto. The author expresses skepticism about the administration's ability to regain executive power and concludes with a willingness to give them a chance, albeit with a hint of doubt, reflected in the willingness to bet only about 300 yen on their success.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided text. However, the mention of ""enhanced rescission"" as a strategy to regain executive power involves the concept of reducing the necessity for affirmative legislative action. This suggests that the author is analyzing the Bush Administration's strategies to navigate around legislative constraints and regain some control over budgetary decisions, which may indirectly affect policies like affirmative action if they pertain to budgetary allocations. Nonetheless, the author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not directly addressed in the excerpt."	0.02833	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Julian Bond, is portrayed as critical of the media's negative and simplistic portrayal of affirmative action. His satirical memo mocks the media's tendency to perpetuate a biased narrative against affirmative action, suggesting that Bond sees the media's arguments as flawed and indicative of an unwillingness to recognize the systemic discrimination that affirmative action aims to counteract. He traces anti-affirmative action arguments back to resistance against desegregation, implying that he views these arguments as recycled and unjust. His critical view of the media's role and his defense of the N.A.A.C.P.'s relevance suggest that he is in favor of affirmative action and opposes the biased narratives that undercut its significance and effectiveness.	"Summary:
Julian Bond, a former N.A.A.C.P. board member and professor, addresses journalists and pundits in a satirical memo regarding the portrayal of the N.A.A.C.P. and the civil rights leadership in the media. The memo sarcastically suggests that the media should work harder to perpetuate the perception that the N.A.A.C.P. is outdated and disconnected from the black community. It proposes various story angles to emphasize this narrative and advises ignoring evidence to the contrary. The memo mocks the media's tendency to seek out sensationalist stories and controversial opinions that fit a predetermined narrative rather than presenting a balanced view of the N.A.A.C.P.'s relevance and the issues facing the black community.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Julian Bond, appears to be critical of the way affirmative action is portrayed in the media and by certain think tanks and pundits. He highlights the use of arguments against affirmative action that suggest it robs blacks of racial pride, makes them wards of the state, and upsets race relations. He points out that these arguments have been recycled over time, tracing back to resistance against desegregation efforts in the 1950s. Bond also notes that there are individuals who claim that affirmative action makes its beneficiaries feel bad, but he warns journalists not to ask if the same is true for whites who receive preferential treatment. The inclusion of this perspective in the satirical memo suggests that Bond sees these arguments as flawed and indicative of a biased narrative against affirmative action that ignores its benefits and the systemic discrimination it aims to counteract. The overall tone of the memo implies that Bond is critical of the media's role in perpetuating negative and simplistic views of affirmative action without a nuanced understanding of its impacts and intentions."	0.02787	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text is critical of 'The Bell Curve' and its underlying arguments, which include the suggestion to abolish affirmative action. This criticism implies a disagreement with the book's conclusions and a belief in the necessity of affirmative action as a countermeasure to deterministic and divisive ideologies. The author's critique of the book's lack of novel science and its political agenda further suggests a stance that is not in alignment with the book's conservative policy recommendations, including those related to affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text critiques ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein that has garnered significant attention and controversy for its discussion on race and intelligence. The authors of ""The Bell Curve"" claim to address a ""taboo issue"" by highlighting the average 15-point difference in I.Q. scores between blacks and whites, suggesting that this gap has profound implications for societal outcomes. However, the author of the text suggests that the book's science is not novel and that its policy recommendations are standard conservative fare. The text compares the book's arguments to those of William Shockley, who decades earlier suggested that lower income and higher crime rates among blacks were due to genetic differences in intelligence. ""The Bell Curve"" is accused of rehashing old ideas for profit and political gain, without contributing new science or original thought. The book is also described as alarmist, with dire predictions for a future society divided by intelligence. Furthermore, the text criticizes the book for its lack of substantive ideas on welfare reform and for its marketing strategy that includes simplified summaries for broader accessibility.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text appears to be critical of ""The Bell Curve"" and its stance on affirmative action. The book is mentioned as advocating for the abolition of affirmative action, which is in line with Shockley's outdated and controversial views on race and intelligence. The author implies that ""The Bell Curve"" uses these arguments to push a political agenda rather than to advance the scientific understanding of intelligence. This perspective indicates that the author is skeptical of the book's motives and does not support its conclusions regarding affirmative action and other policy prescriptions. The criticism suggests a viewpoint that sees affirmative action as a necessary countermeasure to the kind of deterministic and divisive thinking presented in ""The Bell Curve."""	0.02876	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on Bob Dole's political strategies and leadership qualities, mentioning his stance on affirmative action only in the context of his overall political indecisiveness. The author's own view on affirmative action is not clear from the summary, as the discussion centers on Dole's character and campaign tactics rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
Bob Dole, at the age of 73, was contemplating whether to adopt a tougher stance against Bill Clinton in the presidential campaign. During an event in New Jersey, he questioned whether to intensify his critique of Clinton without alienating his audience. By the next day, Dole had decided to be more aggressive in the upcoming debate, a town-hall meeting, which is a difficult setting for confrontational tactics. The debate was scheduled less than three weeks before Election Day, with low expected viewership compared to the 1992 debates.

Dole's hesitation to challenge Clinton's ethics has been criticized. The author argues that if Dole had addressed issues like the FBI file controversy, potential pardons, or foreign campaign contributions more assertively earlier on, he wouldn't appear desperate now. Dole's indecisiveness and tendency to waffle on various issues, including how to confront Pat Buchanan's extremism, mishandling a donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, and his stances on abortion and affirmative action, have led to doubts about his leadership abilities. His inability to take firm stands has been contrasted with his physical courage from 50 years ago, and this inconsistency is seen as damaging to his presidential aspirations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies that Bob Dole's recent abandonment of his long-standing support for affirmative action is one of several examples of his political equivocation. Dole reversed his position to align more closely with the conservative base, suggesting he was trying to rebrand himself in the mold of Ronald Reagan. The author views this reversal not as a principled decision but as a strategic move to appeal to a particular faction within the Republican Party. This is presented as part of a broader pattern of Dole's character failings that include indecisiveness and a lack of political courage, which, according to the author, undermines his credibility as a presidential candidate."	0.029269999999999997	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of the superficiality of apologies for slavery and the lack of substantive change suggests that they value concrete measures to address racial inequalities. Their criticism of Republicans for wanting to end affirmative action without a viable alternative and their acknowledgment of Republican figures who support affirmative action reform indicate a belief in the importance of affirmative action as a tool for addressing these inequalities. The author's perspective on President Clinton's approach further underscores the importance of tangible actions over symbolic gestures. While the author does not explicitly state outright support for affirmative action, their arguments imply that they see it as a necessary component of a larger strategy to combat systemic racial issues.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the U.S. Congress's proposal to officially apologize for slavery, with notable figures like Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich dismissing it as insignificant. The author suggests that an apology without substantive change is meaningless, pointing out that after the Civil War, freed slaves sought tangible improvements such as land ownership, not just apologies. The author argues that Congress should address its own failures in tackling issues like inner-city decline, which are part of the legacy of slavery and segregation.

The author also critiques both political parties for their approach to race and poverty. Republicans are criticized for focusing on ending affirmative action, which is popular in polls, but failing to address the underlying issues of poor education. The party's credible figures on race, Colin Powell, Jack Kemp, and J.C. Watts, support affirmative action reform rather than abolition. President Clinton is accused of having a superficial approach to racial policy, with initiatives like a national conversation and town meetings that may not have a lasting impact. The author acknowledges Clinton's empathy for African-Americans but stresses that empathy alone does not solve issues like employment, housing, or education.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary measure to address racial inequalities. They criticize Republicans for wanting to end it without providing an alternative that would help the poor and note that the only three major Republican figures with credibility on race favor reforming, not abolishing, affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is a concrete tool for addressing racial disparities, and its removal without a safety net for the poor would be a mistake. The text suggests that the author believes in affirmative action as a part of a broader strategy to tackle systemic issues of race and poverty, rather than as a standalone solution."	0.02873	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	Albert Carnesale speaks positively about the role of diversity in education and the importance of affirmative action policies in achieving it. He provides reasons why diversity is essential, such as enhancing education, preparing leaders, and promoting mobility. Although he acknowledges the legal limitations placed on affirmative action, he still advocates for alternative methods to maintain diversity, indicating his support for the goals of affirmative action. His emphasis on outreach and a broad admissions approach further confirms his favorable stance towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
Albert Carnesale, the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), discusses the challenge of maintaining diversity in the wake of California's anti-affirmative action policies. The Regents' policy and Proposition 209 have led to a significant drop in the admission of Hispanic and black students at UCLA's law school and other institutions. Carnesale outlines three reasons why diversity is critical: it enhances education, prepares societal leaders, and promotes social and economic mobility. He shares his own background as a testament to the American dream and emphasizes the need for outreach to minority students and long-term equal educational opportunities. He clarifies that while race and ethnicity can no longer be considered in admissions, other qualities beyond academic scores are still valued, as seen in the diverse backgrounds and talents of the student body, including athletes and artists.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Albert Carnesale appears to be a strong proponent of diversity as a crucial goal for higher education, and he sees affirmative action as one means to achieve that end. He acknowledges that affirmative action is just one approach to fostering diversity, which he deems essential for providing quality education, preparing leaders for all societal segments, and enabling social and economic mobility. Carnesale's perspective is that diversity itself is the ultimate objective, and while affirmative action policies are being challenged and changed, the pursuit of diversity must continue through other methods. He advocates for encouraging minority students to apply and enroll, increasing their eligibility through engagement in high schools, and aspiring to equal educational opportunities for all children. He also points out that universities have always used affirmative action in various forms, considering a wide range of qualities and achievements beyond academic scores, and he suggests that this holistic approach to admissions should continue in order to avoid a ""monochrome higher education."""	0.02777	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary. They recount the events of a national town meeting, including an exchange between President Clinton and Abigail Thernstrom regarding affirmative action, without revealing their personal stance. The author notes the complexity of the issue and the need for more open and detailed dialogue, but does not provide a clear indication of being for or against affirmative action. The focus is on the importance of discussion rather than on taking a side.	"Summary:
President Clinton hosted a national town meeting on race in Akron, Ohio, which aimed to foster a broad discussion on racial issues within the United States. The event was televised and included 67 individuals from various backgrounds, including college students, civic leaders, and businesspeople. While the conversation was initially guarded and lacked dynamism, it gained momentum when Clinton directly addressed Abigail Thernstrom, a panelist critical of affirmative action, questioning whether she would oppose the type of affirmative action that led to General Colin Powell's success in the military. Thernstrom distinguished between affirmative action and racial preferences, a point that merited further discussion but did not receive it. Clinton expressed frustration over the lack of openness in the discussion and hoped that future town meetings would be more fruitful with better planning and a focus on specific issues with concrete examples and engaging guests.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to recognize the complexity and contentious nature of affirmative action as a policy. By highlighting the exchange between President Clinton and Abigail Thernstrom, the author suggests that there is a nuanced debate to be had regarding the difference between affirmative action and racial preferences. The author acknowledges the success of affirmative action in the context of the military, using General Colin Powell's rise as an example, and implies that a more in-depth discussion on such successes could be beneficial. Overall, the author seems to advocate for a more detailed and open dialogue on affirmative action, indicating that such discussions can be enlightening and are necessary for understanding the policy's implications and effectiveness."	0.02139	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Lani Guinier, expresses a clear support for the goals of affirmative action, such as diversity and equal opportunity in education. She points out the negative impact of California's ban on affirmative action, implying that it leads to a less diverse and potentially resegregated higher education system. Conversely, she commends Texas for implementing the '10 percent plan' as an innovative solution that promotes diversity without explicitly using race as a criterion, which indicates her approval of affirmative action policies when they contribute to inclusivity and equity. Her emphasis on the importance of improving primary education to address the achievement gap further underscores her belief in the principles underlying affirmative action. Therefore, the author is portrayed as being in favor of affirmative action, particularly when it is part of a broader strategy to promote social justice and educational excellence.	"Summary:
The text discusses the contrasting outcomes of affirmative action policies in California and Texas. Following California's ban on race and ethnicity considerations in public college admissions, there was a significant drop in admissions for blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians at top University of California campuses, raising concerns about resegregation in higher education. In contrast, Texas, after a federal court ruling against race in admissions, implemented the ""10 percent plan,"" which automatically admits students in the top 10 percent of their high school class to the state's most selective public universities, regardless of SAT scores. This has led to an increase in eligible black and Mexican-American applicants, as well as improved access for white students from rural areas. Texas has also introduced measures to improve primary education by requiring schools to report performance data by race, ethnicity, and economic status, leading to a narrowing of the achievement gap. Texas fourth graders have shown significant improvements in national math tests, while California's performance has declined.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Lani Guinier, appears to support affirmative action and its goals of diversity and equal opportunity in education. She highlights the negative consequences of California's ban on affirmative action, suggesting it leads to a less diverse and potentially resegregated higher education system. In contrast, she praises Texas for finding an innovative solution that promotes diversity without explicitly using race as a criterion, thereby creating a more inclusive and equitable admissions process. The author also emphasizes the importance of improving primary education and addressing the needs of all students, which can contribute to closing the achievement gap and promoting excellence. Overall, the author seems to advocate for affirmative action as a means to achieve social justice and diversity, while also recognizing the need for creative and inclusive approaches to maintain these values."	0.02878	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Henry Louis Gates Jr., is somewhat in favor of affirmative action. He acknowledges the positive impact it has had on the growth of the black middle class and views it as a necessary tool to overcome historical barriers to education and economic opportunity for African Americans. While he doesn't explicitly advocate for the expansion or continuation of affirmative action, his recognition of its benefits and his concern for addressing new challenges, such as the digital divide, suggest a favorable perspective towards the policy.	"Summary:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical importance of literacy for African Americans, tracing it back to the Stono Rebellion of 1739. He emphasizes how literacy was a symbol of humanity and a tool for liberation. Gates points out that while slavery and segregation sought to disconnect African Americans from education and opportunity, affirmative action programs have helped grow the black middle class. However, he raises concerns about the digital divide in the modern era, where African Americans are lagging behind in accessing the internet and personal computers, which he sees as the new tools of literacy. He notes that income alone does not explain this gap and that content relevant to African Americans is lacking online. Gates argues that community efforts and culturally relevant content could help bridge this digital divide, and he emphasizes the importance of African Americans mastering new information technology to avoid a new form of segregation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Henry Louis Gates Jr., views affirmative action positively, as he credits it with the significant growth of the black middle class since the late 1960s. He sees affirmative action as a tool that has helped African Americans overcome historical barriers to education and economic opportunity. Gates suggests that despite these advancements, there are new challenges—such as the digital divide—that need to be addressed to prevent further social and economic disparities. Gates implies that just as affirmative action was crucial in creating educational and professional opportunities for African Americans in the past, similar proactive measures may be necessary to ensure equitable access to technology and the benefits it provides."	0.0286	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's depiction of Richard Barrett's rally against affirmative action in a negative light, highlighting the community's response of unity and diversity, suggests a disapproval of Barrett's stance. By emphasizing the town's historical fight for freedom and equality, the author appears to align with values that are contrary to Barrett's message. Additionally, the author's acknowledgment of a sign commemorating a black resident's death at the hands of police indicates an awareness of racial issues, further distancing the author from Barrett's viewpoints. The overall tone of rejecting Barrett's racist message and affirming the town's commitment to diversity and inclusion indicates a perspective that is critical of Barrett's position on affirmative action.	"Summary:
In Morristown, a town with historical significance from the Revolutionary War, the Fourth of July celebrations were overshadowed by a rally held by Richard Barrett, a white supremacist from Mississippi. Barrett, leader of the Nationalist Movement, chose Morristown to equate his opposition to affirmative action and minority ""privileges"" with George Washington's rejection of monarchical privileges. His presence prompted a demonstration that resulted in police intervention and arrests. In response, Morristown residents gathered at the Calvary Baptist Church for a diversity celebration, organized by the mayor to avoid direct confrontation with Barrett. The event was a display of unity across different races and religions, countering Barrett's divisive message. However, the town's racial harmony is not perfect, as evidenced by a sign commemorating a black resident's death at the hands of police, which some view as an instance of racial profiling. The following day, Barrett's small group was met by a larger, hostile crowd, leading to clashes and further arrests. Despite the tensions, the town's commitment to democracy and diversity endured.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of Barrett's stance on affirmative action and his racist ideologies. By contrasting Barrett's small and ""anemic"" anti-affirmative action protest with the large, diverse gathering at the church, the author suggests community solidarity against Barrett’s message. The author also highlights the town's history of fighting for freedom and equality, implying that Barrett's views are out of step with these values. The mention of a local sign commemorating the death of a black resident suggests the author acknowledges ongoing racial issues, but the overall tone of the article is one of rejecting Barrett's racist message and affirming the town's commitment to diversity and inclusion."	0.03007	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author presents Dr. Formicola's work in increasing minority enrollment and establishing community health centers in a positive light, suggesting that they support affirmative action principles. The focus on Dr. Formicola's success in addressing inequality and improving diversity within the dental school indicates that the author believes in the value of such efforts. The article's tone and content suggest that the author is in favor of proactive measures to increase opportunities for historically marginalized groups, which is a key aspect of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the positive impact of Dr. Allan J. Formicola, retiring dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, on minority enrollment and community dental care in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Dr. Formicola, who has served for 23 years, is credited with increasing the number of minority students at the dental school and establishing community health centers and dental clinics in the area. His efforts are seen as an answer to the question of what those in power owe to underprivileged communities. The article also touches on the historical tension between Columbia University and the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the general lack of minority representation in the dental profession. With Dr. Formicola's retirement, there is hope that Columbia will continue his legacy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view Dr. Formicola's work as a positive example of what can be achieved through proactive efforts to increase diversity and address inequality, which are core principles of affirmative action. Dr. Formicola's approach to attracting minority students and serving underserved communities aligns with the goals of affirmative action to provide opportunities for historically marginalized groups. The author highlights the success of Dr. Formicola's initiatives in a way that suggests support for affirmative action policies, emphasizing the importance of leadership in bridging gaps between institutions and the communities they serve. The article implies that affirmative action and similar efforts are necessary to correct long-standing disparities and ensure that professional fields like dentistry are more representative of the broader population."	0.02662	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, focusing instead on critiquing Trent Lott's and the Republican Party's sincerity regarding racial equality issues. The criticism of Lott's sudden support for affirmative action as insincere, and the pointing out of the Republican Party's use of diversity as a PR strategy, suggest that the author may be skeptical of affirmative action as a political tool rather than as a policy. However, without a clear statement of the author's own views on affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize their stance definitively.	"Summary:
Trent Lott, a Republican senator, found himself in a political crisis after expressing support for the segregationist views of Strom Thurmond at Thurmond's 100th birthday celebration. In an attempt to recover his standing, Lott made statements in favor of affirmative action and proposed a holiday to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation, moves that seemed out of step with his party's positions. His actions were perceived as pandering and insincere. The author criticizes the media and political parties for ignoring Lott's previous associations with racist organizations and only taking action when his comments became a public relations issue for the Republican Party. The author also critiques the Republican Party's history of exploiting racial tensions for political gain and questions the sincerity of the party's commitment to racial equality, citing examples of other Republican leaders with questionable records on race-related issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their own perspective on affirmative action in the provided text. However, they do criticize Trent Lott's sudden endorsement of ""across the board"" affirmative action as a transparent and desperate attempt to salvage his reputation after his controversial remarks. The author implies skepticism about the genuineness of such a stance coming from Lott, given his political history and the context of his scandal. Additionally, the author points out the Republican Party's superficial use of ""diversity"" and ""compassionate conservatism"" as public relations strategies rather than as genuine policy positions, suggesting a critical view of how affirmative action and related concepts are sometimes manipulated in political discourse."	0.037489999999999996	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, James O. Freedman, is described as a supporter of affirmative action, actively engaging in efforts to promote it. His involvement with the American Jewish Committee and the preparation of a brief for the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program clearly indicate that he is an advocate for these policies. The text outlines his belief in the importance of affirmative action for the education of minority students and suggests that he views it as essential for America's future. His actions and beliefs reflect a strong commitment to diversity and inclusivity in educational settings.	"Summary:
James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth College, is a staunch advocate for liberal education, which he believes is essential for understanding oneself, developing a moral compass, and gaining an appreciation of how society and democracies function. Despite the trend of students gravitating towards more practical subjects, Freedman argues that a liberal education provides a significant advantage in the job market due to the critical thinking and writing skills it imparts. His commitment to these ideals is reflected in his new book, ""Liberal Education and the Public Interest.""

Freedman has been battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but remains focused on promoting liberal values. He has also been active in public service, supporting affirmative action programs and advocating for tolerance and civility on college campuses, including addressing issues faced by Jewish students. In his personal life, Freedman has faced cancer multiple times and draws upon his liberal arts background to navigate these challenges. He continues to write and engage in intellectual discussions, serving as a mentor and advisor to others in academia.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
James O. Freedman is supportive of affirmative action. He views it as crucial for the education of minority men and women and believes that America's future depends on it. As a member of the American Jewish Committee's board of governors, Freedman helped prepare a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. His actions demonstrate a commitment to creating diverse and inclusive educational environments and suggest that he sees affirmative action as a means to achieve social justice and equality in higher education."	0.032100000000000004	affirmative action	txt/432317583.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. This stance is inferred from the discussion of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's background and the author's interpretation of her skepticism towards an absolute colorblind approach to admissions. The author acknowledges O'Connor's conservative leanings but also highlights her history of considering the real-world implications of court decisions and her potential empathy towards affirmative action due to her own experiences with overcoming gender barriers. The comparison of O'Connor's appointment to the Supreme Court to an act of affirmative action suggests the author sees value in such policies for providing opportunities to underrepresented groups.	"Summary:
The text discusses a Supreme Court case regarding the constitutionality of affirmative action, with Kirk Kolbo arguing against it and facing questions from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The University of Michigan's admissions policies, which consider race among other factors, were being challenged. Justice O'Connor, known as the swing vote on the court, showed skepticism towards the argument for absolute colorblindness in admissions. Her background includes overcoming gender barriers in her career, and she has often been a decisive vote in critical cases, including those on abortion rights. Despite her conservative leanings, O'Connor has been known to consider the real-world impact of the Court's decisions and has not always sided with conservative or callous positions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Justice O'Connor may be sympathetic to affirmative action despite her conservative track record. The author notes her history of breaking away from conservative majorities at crucial moments and her tendency to consider the specific facts and real-world implications of cases. O'Connor's questioning during the oral arguments seemed to indicate discomfort with the idea that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness in university admissions. The text implies that O'Connor's personal experiences, including her own appointment to the Supreme Court—which the author likens to an act of affirmative action by President Reagan—might influence her to empathize with minority applicants who benefit from affirmative action policies. The author seems to believe that Justice O'Connor recognizes the value of such policies in creating opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups and may view them as consistent with her own experiences of overcoming barriers."	0.02921	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author is critical of affirmative action in the context of Jayson Blair's case, suggesting that Blair received undue chances possibly because of his race, which the author associates with affirmative action policies. This criticism is specific to the perceived misuse or misapplication of affirmative action rather than a blanket condemnation of its principles. While the author does not dismiss the importance of diversity in journalism, they emphasize the need for a balance between diversity initiatives and holding individuals accountable for their performance. Thus, the author's stance is critical of how affirmative action was implemented in this scenario but not necessarily against the concept as a whole.	"Summary:
The text is an email from a New York Times columnist discussing the scandal involving Jayson Blair, a former Times reporter who committed journalistic fraud through plagiarism and fabrication. The Times team has thoroughly investigated Blair's deceit, which is considered a low point in the newspaper's history. The columnist reflects on how Blair was able to deceive the editorial system, suggesting that he was given too many chances because he was a young, ambitious black journalist, which hints at affirmative action considerations. The executive editor, Howell Raines, is committed to transparency and preventing future communication failures. The scandal has caused a range of reactions in Washington, with liberals disappointed and conservatives experiencing schadenfreude. The columnist also defends the Times against accusations of biased news coverage and addresses the broader implications of diversity in journalism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least as it was applied in the case of Jayson Blair. He suggests that Blair was promoted beyond his capabilities because the editors were eager to see a black journalist succeed, implying that this was due to the newspaper's commitment to diversity. The author uses the scandal to argue that affirmative action can backfire, as it may have contributed to Blair being treated with ""kid gloves"" rather than being held accountable for his numerous mistakes. However, the author also acknowledges the importance of diversity in the media world and supports the idea of giving opportunities to underrepresented groups such as black, Hispanic, and Asian journalists. Despite the criticism of how affirmative action was implemented in this particular case, the author does not reject the concept entirely but rather calls for a balance between diversity and accountability."	0.02778	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author of the text provides a balanced examination of affirmative action, acknowledging the arguments from both supporters and critics. They recognize the current need for affirmative action to promote diversity and equal opportunity in higher education, while also considering the viewpoint that it may not address the root causes of educational disparities. The author's mention of Justice O'Connor's hope for a future without the need for racial preferences suggests an understanding of affirmative action as a temporary measure. However, the author does not explicitly endorse or reject affirmative action, instead focusing on the broader conversation about achieving educational equality. This balanced approach without a clear lean towards support or opposition places the author in a neutral stance regarding affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court decision mentioned in the text upheld affirmative action in university admissions but suggested a future where such measures may no longer be necessary. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in her majority opinion, anticipated that racial preferences would not be needed in 25 years. The ruling prompted discussions on whether O'Connor's statement would become a legal principle and what steps should be taken to achieve educational equality among racial and ethnic groups. There is a persistent gap in academic success indicators such as the SAT and ACT between white and minority students. Some argue for financial parity in education, while others believe that the problem lies in deeper socioeconomic issues. The debate on affirmative action remains polarized, with proponents arguing it is necessary until the education system is fixed, while opponents believe it distracts from addressing the root causes of educational disparities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a balanced view of the affirmative action debate, acknowledging the complexities and challenges involved in addressing the educational achievement gap. The perspective seems to be that affirmative action is seen as a temporary but necessary measure to ensure diversity and opportunity in higher education until broader societal and educational inequalities can be addressed. Justice O'Connor's hope is that with concerted efforts to improve education for young people, the need for affirmative action will diminish. However, the author also highlights the arguments from both sides of the debate, indicating that while there is consensus on the need to close the education gap, there is no agreement on how to do so or on the role of affirmative action in that process. The author suggests that unless there is a significant commitment from society and minority families to prioritize education, the same issues may persist even after the 25-year period mentioned by Justice O'Connor."	0.04022	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as supportive based on their positive reaction to the Supreme Court upholding the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. The author's description of the decision as a reflection of national consensus and alignment with mainstream American values, along with their concern about maintaining this stance in the face of potential further conservative appointments to the Court, suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the Supreme Court's decisions during a particular term, suggesting that the Court demonstrated a moderate stance, contrary to expectations based on its conservative composition. The Court upheld the University of Michigan's affirmative action program, protected gay sexual relations under the Constitution, and affirmed that state employees are fully protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, the Court also upheld California's ""three strikes"" law, imposing a harsh sentence on a minor theft case. The author notes the Court's conservative justices' far-right ideology, especially in their dissent on the gay sex case. The term's decisions are expected to motivate right-wing activists to seek more conservative appointees, potentially shifting the Court's balance. The author urges the Senate and the public to prevent this from happening, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Court's alignment with mainstream American values.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, as indicated by their approval of the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions. The author views the decision as a ratification of a national consensus that race can be considered in admissions, provided that quotas and rigid formulas are not used. The author's positive portrayal of this ruling suggests that they see affirmative action as a necessary and reasonable practice for promoting diversity and equality in education and beyond. The text also implies that the author believes the Court's decision on affirmative action reflects the ""best instincts of the American people,"" indicating that they view the policy as aligned with broader societal values."	0.02522	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt	2
	None	The author, Sam Tanenhaus, does not provide a clear perspective on affirmative action within the provided summary. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of describing President Bush's political positions to illustrate the point about political ideologies' fluidity and inconsistency. There is no direct discussion or analysis of affirmative action that would reveal Tanenhaus's stance on the issue.	"Summary:
Sam Tanenhaus discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, where liberal presidential candidates are clashing with the party's moderate leaders and strategists. The moderates are concerned that leaning too far left will lead to electoral defeats similar to those in 1972 and 1984. Tanenhaus argues that this fear overlooks the success Republicans have had by embracing their passionate base and selecting candidates that energize their core supporters. He suggests that ideology may not be as decisive in elections as passion and energy, which are brought by those with strong beliefs. The article draws parallels to the 1964 election, where despite warnings of extremism, Barry Goldwater's nomination eventually led to a revitalized conservative movement and the Republican Party's eventual shift away from moderate politics, culminating in Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980. Tanenhaus concludes that the Democratic Party should learn from the Republican experience and listen to its ""extremists,"" as they might have valuable insights.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Sam Tanenhaus, briefly mentions affirmative action in the context of President Bush's varied political positions, stating that Bush appears as a small-government conservative with tax cuts for the wealthy, a big-government liberal with prescription drug benefits, and at times a social liberal favoring some types of affirmative action, yet also a social conservative opposed to gay marriage. This mention is used to illustrate the fluidity and inconsistency of political ideologies in leaders. However, Tanenhaus does not delve deeply into affirmative action or provide his own perspective on it. The mention is more about the complexity and seeming contradictions in political stances rather than an endorsement or critique of affirmative action itself."	0.03159	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	Ian Haney Lopez demonstrates a clear stance in favor of affirmative action, critiquing the Supreme Court's misinterpretation of Brown v. Board of Education and advocating for a 14th Amendment law that addresses racial subordination. His argument suggests that affirmative action is a necessary tool to combat historical and ongoing discrimination and that the current judicial approach undermines these efforts. Lopez's perspective is rooted in the belief that race-conscious government actions, such as affirmative action, are distinct from laws that perpetuate racial subjugation and are essential for achieving equality. His advocacy for a legal framework that actively opposes racial subordination aligns with principles supporting affirmative action.	"Summary:
Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor, discusses the significance of Hernandez v. Texas, a Supreme Court case decided on May 3, 1954, which he believes has been overshadowed by the more famous Brown v. Board of Education. He argues that Hernandez is crucial for understanding constitutional protection against discrimination because it established the principle that protections should apply to any group that suffers subordination, not just those defined by race. The case involved Mexican-Americans who were subjected to discriminatory practices akin to those experienced by African Americans under Jim Crow laws. Lopez criticizes the current interpretation of Brown by the Supreme Court, which he feels erroneously equates any race-conscious government action with racism, thereby undermining affirmative action and allowing systemic discrimination that isn't explicitly based on race to go unchallenged. He suggests that Hernandez, not Brown, should be at the heart of a 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ian Haney Lopez expresses a critical view of the Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action. He believes that the Court's majority has misinterpreted Brown v. Board of Education to mean that the Constitution only opposes the state's use of formal racial distinctions, rather than systematic oppression based on race. He takes issue with this interpretation because it creates substantial constitutional barriers against all race-conscious government actions, including affirmative action, which are intended to address and rectify historical and ongoing discrimination. Lopez argues that this approach fails to recognize the difference between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits based on race to correct past injustices. He contends that the Court should instead focus on ending racial subordination, as suggested by the precedent set in Hernandez v. Texas. Lopez advocates for a robust 14th Amendment law that actively works against racial subordination, which would better support the principles underlying affirmative action."	0.03239	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	2
	None	The text provided does not contain sufficient information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action. It mentions a quiz question related to President Bush's position on a Supreme Court justice, with 'Pro-affirmative action' as one of the possible answers. However, the author's own views on the matter are not discussed or revealed in the summary. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot accurately determine the author's perspective on affirmative action.	"Summary:
This text presents a series of questions and answers related to political figures and events, seemingly in the context of a quiz. The questions cover a range of topics, including statements made by President George W. Bush about Osama bin Laden, John Kerry's response to a report comparing his IQ to Bush's, proposals for Social Security reform, political advertisements, the disappearance of explosives in Iraq, celebrity political endorsements, Supreme Court justice preferences, the decision to invade Iraq, campaign strategies, and comments by politicians. The answers are provided at the end, along with the correct responses to the questions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from question 11, which asks about President Bush's position on a Supreme Court justice. The correct answer given is (e) Pro-slavery, which indicates that the author does not directly address Bush's views on affirmative action in this set of questions. However, the inclusion of ""Pro-affirmative action"" as one of the options (d) suggests that the topic is relevant in the context of judicial appointments and political debates. Without additional context or explicit commentary, it's not possible to determine the author's personal perspective on affirmative action based on this text alone."	0.029670000000000002	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but they highlight the tension and controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers' presidency at Harvard, particularly in relation to his perceived conservative stance on issues such as affirmative action. By contrasting Summers with his predecessors and noting the criticism from liberals on campus, the author suggests that Summers is less supportive of affirmative action. However, the author's primary focus is on the broader political debates at Harvard rather than on a clear position for or against affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not explicitly articulated, but they seem to be emphasizing the conservative shift under Summers, which includes a less favorable view toward affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, who suggested that men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude. This sparked protests on campus and reignited the debate about Harvard's identity as either liberal or conservative. The university's policies and direction are scrutinized through the lens of political ideology, with liberals and conservatives offering differing views on issues such as the number of tenured women professors, campus expansion, and the use of the university's endowment. Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, is seen as conservative within the academic context for his stances on issues like affirmative action and campus policies. The text also touches on the broader implications of these debates for Harvard's future.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action as a contentious issue at Harvard, with the university's identity and direction being influenced by the political leanings of its leadership and faculty. The author contrasts Summers' approach with that of his predecessors, Neil Rudenstine and Derek Bok, who were more inclined towards inclusivity and affirmative action, respectively. Summers' actions and statements have led to confrontations and criticism, suggesting he is not in favor of affirmative action, as noted by Professor Harvey Mansfield. The author implies that Summers' presidency has been marked by a shift towards a more conservative stance on issues like affirmative action, which has sparked debate and resistance from liberals on campus."	0.03197	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text uses the term 'affirmative action' in a critical and somewhat sarcastic manner when referring to John McCain's background, suggesting that McCain's admission to Annapolis may have been influenced by his family's legacy rather than his own merit. This implies a negative view of unearned advantages. However, the author praises Barack Obama's self-made success and emphasizes that his achievements were based on his own abilities, as he did not disclose his race on his Harvard Law School application. The author appreciates individual merit over systemic advantages, which indicates a critical view of affirmative action when it leads to unearned benefits. However, the text does not provide a comprehensive view on affirmative action policies in general or in contexts other than the specific comparison between Obama and McCain.	"Summary:
The text describes the apparent envy that various political figures feel towards Barack Obama's rise in politics. Bill Clinton is depicted as unable to conceal his jealousy, even when asked about Obama's readiness for presidency. Jesse Jackson is represented as feeling his civil rights era influence diminishing in the face of Obama's new approach. John McCain is also described as envious, abandoning his principles and engaging in petty campaign tactics against Obama, which even his own mother and former strategist criticize. McCain's envy is attributed to his self-image as a maverick being overshadowed by Obama's cool and intellectual persona. The text also suggests that McCain, who benefited from being a legacy at Annapolis, recognizes Obama's intelligence and self-made success, which contrasts with his own background.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and somewhat sarcastic when discussing McCain's background. The text suggests that McCain is the ""affirmative action scion of admirals,"" implying that he may have gained admission to Annapolis due to his family connections rather than merit. In contrast, the author notes that Obama did not even disclose his race on his Harvard Law School application, highlighting Obama's achievements as being based on his own abilities rather than affirmative action policies. The use of the term ""affirmative action"" in this context seems to criticize the idea of unearned advantage based on family legacy, while simultaneously praising individual merit and achievement as exemplified by Obama."	0.028880000000000003	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt	2
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be 'strongly in favor' of affirmative action. They highlight the policy's success in diversifying America's elite and creating opportunities for minority leaders, citing the achievements of prominent figures who have benefited from affirmative action. The author also shares personal experiences as a beneficiary of affirmative action and discusses the positive impact it has had on their life and the lives of others by integrating a broader spectrum of society. The reflection on the complexities and challenges faced by minorities while navigating traditionally white-dominated environments does not detract from their overall supportive stance on the policy. Instead, it provides a nuanced understanding of the policy's implications and the concept of 'double consciousness' that beneficiaries often experience.	"Summary:
The text traces the impact of affirmative action policies initiated by America's top universities in 1969, which aimed to diversify their student bodies by actively recruiting Black and Latino students. The author reflects on the success of these policies, citing prominent figures like Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett as examples of the new elite shaped by affirmative action. Despite their achievements, the author discusses the complex and often ambiguous status of these individuals, who navigate a ""double consciousness"" between their ethnic identities and the world opened to them by their education. The text also explores the personal experiences of the author, who benefited from affirmative action, and the challenges faced by minorities in adapting to environments that were traditionally white-dominated. The author suggests that affirmative action has been essential for integrating a broader spectrum of society and creating opportunities for minority leaders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a transformative policy that has enabled the rise of a diverse elite in America. They recognize the policy as a response to the civil rights movement and an attempt by universities to train leaders who better represent the country's demographics. The author acknowledges the skepticism and anxiety that surrounded the early days of affirmative action, both from the recipients and the originators of these programs. However, they also highlight the advantages that affirmative action beneficiaries gained, such as learning to navigate multiple worlds and absorbing new ideas and values.

The author personally relates to the experiences of affirmative action recipients, having been one themselves, and understands the feelings of inadequacy and the pressure to prove oneself in an environment where one's qualifications are often questioned. They also discuss the concept of ""double consciousness,"" which allows individuals to move between their cultural heritage and the new opportunities afforded to them by their education.

Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action has been a crucial step in creating a more inclusive and representative leadership in America, despite the ongoing complexities and challenges that come with it. The author believes that the experiences of the ""children of 1969"" have paved the way for figures like Barack Obama and have the potential to change the national conversation on race."	0.04004	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author does not provide an in-depth analysis of affirmative action itself but does present it as a position held by a well-qualified nominee for a federal judgeship. The author's mention of Goodwin Liu's support for affirmative action is framed in a context where this support is considered part of the mainstream legal and political landscape, and the author criticizes the opposition to Liu based on his progressive views. The description suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a legitimate stance that should not be a barrier to confirmation, indicating a positive view of the policy. However, since the author's focus is more on the political process of judicial confirmation rather than affirmative action as a policy, their stance is not strongly articulated. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, but this is not the central argument of the text.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to consider several nominees for federal judgeships who have been previously approved by the committee but were blocked from a full Senate vote by Republicans. These nominees, including Goodwin Liu, must be re-nominated due to an obscure Senate rule. Liu, a well-qualified candidate with an impressive educational background and legal experience, is opposed by Republicans largely because of his progressive views on issues such as same-sex marriage and affirmative action, and his belief in a living Constitution. Despite this opposition, he has received support from figures across the political spectrum, including conservative lawyer Kenneth Starr. The author urges the White House and Senate Democrats to continue pushing for the confirmation of Liu and other nominees, noting that a lower percentage of Obama's nominees have been confirmed compared to those during Bush's presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, as they describe Goodwin Liu's backing of the policy as one of the reasons for Republican opposition, yet they also note that Liu's views are within the legal and political mainstream. The author does not directly critique affirmative action but implies that opposition to Liu based on his support for such policies is unfounded, given his qualifications and broad support from legal scholars and professionals. The author's perspective seems to align with the idea that affirmative action is a legitimate and mainstream legal stance that should not disqualify a well-qualified nominee from serving as a federal judge."	0.02377	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The summary provided does not give enough information to accurately assess the author's stance on affirmative action. The text discusses Clarence Thomas's conservative views and the controversy surrounding his Supreme Court nomination, including his stance on affirmative action. However, the author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not clearly expressed in the summary. The focus is on how Thomas's views on affirmative action may have influenced the controversy he faced rather than the author's own stance on the policy.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 1991 controversy involving Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. The author expresses skepticism about the scandal, questioning the response to the allegations and the timing of Hill's disclosure. The piece also touches on the recent actions of Thomas's wife, Ginni, who left a voicemail for Hill asking for an apology, and the emergence of Lillian McEwen, a former girlfriend of Thomas, who corroborated Hill's account. The author mentions Ginni Thomas's involvement with the Tea Party movement and McEwen's memoir. Clarence Thomas's personal struggles and transformation are also described, referencing his memoir and his impact on the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Clarence Thomas's real ""offense"" was not the alleged harassment but rather his conservative stance on issues, particularly his critical view of affirmative action. The author implies that Thomas's opposition to affirmative action, which he believed might harm those it was intended to help, was a significant factor in the controversy he faced during his nomination. The perspective presented is that Thomas's conservative beliefs, especially as a black man, were met with hostility and contributed to the scrutiny and challenges he encountered."	0.02412	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt	2
	None	The author's primary concern is the political process and the toxicity in the confirmation of Supreme Court justices, particularly in the case of Robert Bork. While the author does reference Bork's critical stance on affirmative action, the text does not delve deeply into the author's own views on the policy. Instead, it focuses on the political tactics used to prevent Bork's confirmation. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central theme of the text, and as such, their stance on the issue is not clearly outlined.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the Senate's rejection of Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination 24 years prior to the date of writing. Bork was a highly qualified legal intellectual, known for his originalist views and judicial restraint. He was critical of Roe v. Wade, affirmative action rulings, and the application of the First Amendment to pornography. The author argues that Bork's views were not extreme, and that his rejection marked the beginning of an era of toxic politics, where civil discourse deteriorated and partisan obstructionism became commonplace. The author suggests that Democrats, fearing Bork would shift the Supreme Court to a conservative majority, resorted to character assassination and unfair tactics to prevent his confirmation. This set a precedent for future judicial nominations, leading to nominees hiding their judicial philosophies until after confirmation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions that Bork found the court's rulings on affirmative action to be problematic, indicating a critical stance towards affirmative action policies. However, the author's main focus is not on affirmative action itself, but on the broader political and judicial implications of Bork's nomination and the tactics used to oppose it. The author seems to imply that the contentious confirmation process, including the fight over issues like affirmative action, has contributed to the polarized and combative political environment surrounding the Supreme Court nominations."	0.02626	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt	2
	None	The author discusses affirmative action in the context of political strategy, without expressing a personal stance on the policy itself. The author's focus is on how politicians like Bill Clinton have used affirmative action as a tool to secure their political base and appeal to swing voters, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action. Therefore, the author's perspective is not directly concerned with the policy of affirmative action, but rather with its utility in the realm of political strategy.	"Summary:
The author examines the reasons behind President George W. Bush's increasing public approval, countering the notion that Bush's success is merely due to low expectations, a weak predecessor, a charming personality, or a focused agenda. The author acknowledges having previously underestimated Bush's intelligence, particularly criticizing his verbal skills. However, the author now recognizes Bush's political intelligence, which involves understanding and manipulating people and situations, as a key asset.

The author compares Bush's political strategy to that of former President Bill Clinton, noting their shared use of ""triangulation"" to win elections. This strategy involves satisfying a core group of ideological supporters, neutralizing opposition from a staunch anti-core, and appealing to swing voters. Clinton did this by firmly supporting core Democratic issues while compromising on others, thereby attracting swing voters. Bush is seen as applying a similar approach but with conservative priorities, such as abortion and tax policies.

The author highlights Bush's stance against racial profiling as an example of his political intelligence. This move is viewed as weakening his opposition, which tries to paint him as a racist, while also appealing to swing voters and not alienating his core supporters.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is presented through the lens of political strategy rather than a moral or ideological stance. The author describes how Bill Clinton championed affirmative action as one of the ""nonnegotiables"" for his core supporters. Clinton's unwavering support for affirmative action, along with other core issues like abortion rights and minority representation, is portrayed as a calculated move to secure his base while allowing him to be flexible on other issues to win over swing voters.

The author's focus is on the political intelligence behind supporting affirmative action as a means to satisfy a political base, rather than expressing a personal opinion on the policy itself. The discussion is framed within the context of successful political maneuvering rather than an endorsement or critique of affirmative action as a policy."	0.029500000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	2
2	neutral	The author's perspective suggests a preference for reparations over affirmative action as a means to address historical injustices faced by African-Americans. While the text does not explicitly state the author's stance on affirmative action, the comparison of reparations to affirmative action indicates a belief that reparations are a more effective and less divisive approach. The author's support for reparations, a form of restorative justice, suggests a recognition of systemic issues and a desire to address them in a comprehensive manner. However, without explicit commentary on affirmative action itself, it is challenging to categorize the author's stance as anything other than 'neutral' or 'not concerned' with affirmative action, as their focus is on reparations rather than affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historic ruling where the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to pay reparations to African-American farmers for past racial discrimination. This settlement came from a class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 by black farmers who accused the USDA of bias in distributing loans and subsidies. The settlement includes at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief for each affected farmer and the return of foreclosed lands. The decline of African-American farmers from 14% in 1920 to less than 1% is attributed to the USDA's discriminatory practices. Although the settlement is seen as insufficient by many, it is considered a step towards addressing the broader issue of reparations for African-Americans for historical injustices, including slavery and discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view reparations as a more comprehensive and potentially less divisive solution than affirmative action and other preference policies for addressing historical racial injustices. They suggest that reparations, spread throughout the tax system, are justified both economically and morally, providing a means to redress the accumulation of disadvantages suffered by African-Americans. The author compares the U.S. reparations to those paid by Germany to Israel for the Holocaust, implying a moral obligation to address wrongs of the past. The text indicates that while affirmative action debates can be acrimonious, reparations offer a logical and morally responsible way to compensate for centuries of racial bias and its effects on the current economic disparities between black and white Americans."	0.02788	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt	2
1	somewhat_against	The author discusses the achievements of John H. Johnson and his philosophy of making oneself indispensable. While the author does not explicitly state a position for or against affirmative action, the use of the anecdote about Matthew Henson suggests that Johnson valued individual merit and self-reliance. The emphasis on Johnson's personal initiative and success without direct reference to affirmative action implies that the author might lean towards the idea that personal effort is paramount. However, without a clear statement against affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize the author as strongly against it. The author appears to be neutral or somewhat against affirmative action, focusing on individual achievement over reliance on affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text is a tribute to John H. Johnson, a pioneering African American publisher who passed away at the age of 87. Johnson was known for his successful business philosophy encapsulated in his advice, ""Make yourself indispensable."" He founded influential publications such as Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, which provided a positive vision of black America and a platform for black consumers and journalists. His autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" details his tenacity and problem-solving skills, from overcoming educational barriers in Arkansas to launching his magazines with limited resources. Johnson was also instrumental in demonstrating the value of the black consumer market to advertisers, leading to a breakthrough in black-oriented media. His life story is celebrated as a series of case studies in leadership and problem-solving.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clarence Page, reflects on Johnson's perspective on affirmative action through an anecdote about Matthew Henson, a black man who played a crucial role in Admiral Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole. Johnson highlighted that Henson was not hired because of affirmative action or charity, but because he had made himself indispensable by learning the language of the Inuit people. This suggests that Johnson believed in the importance of individual merit and self-reliance rather than relying solely on programs like affirmative action. Johnson's own success in persuading major corporate advertisers to invest in black-oriented media, and his eventual election to the board of directors of Zenith Electronics, exemplifies his belief in the power of personal initiative and indispensability over affirmative action policies."	0.028450000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt	2
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors collectively exhibit varying degrees of support for affirmative action, with nuances in their viewpoints. Mallory Duncan and Michael Farzan express clear support, with Duncan focusing on the need to maintain affirmative action to address historical biases and Farzan advocating for its expansion to include economic factors. Tom O'Hare supports equal treatment, suggesting a nuanced view that may still be in favor of affirmative action but with a focus on its implementation to avoid condescension. Tom Barnard's argument suggests that he is in favor of affirmative action, as he criticizes the administration's inconsistent stance on diversity. No author expresses a neutral, against, or non-concerned stance directly; all engage with the concept of affirmative action critically and from a perspective of supporting diversity in admissions.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss the U.S. administration's decision to no longer consider race as a factor in college admissions. Mallory Duncan notes that colleges have historically given preference to legacy students, athletes, and those from underrepresented states, but now only students of color are labeled as beneficiaries of affirmative action. Michael Farzan criticizes President Trump's policy as pandering to white resentment and suggests including economic status in affirmative action. Tom O’Hare argues for treating African-Americans and Latinos as equals without condescension based on historical injustices. Tom Barnard questions why gender diversity is acceptable in college admissions when racial diversity is not, given that there is no history of discrimination against men in education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors of these letters generally support the concept of affirmative action, though they have different perspectives on its implementation and the recent policy changes.

- Mallory Duncan highlights the historical context of affirmative action and criticizes the current administration for seemingly targeting only black and brown students with their policy changes. Duncan's perspective is that affirmative action should continue to promote diversity and redress past biases.
  
- Michael Farzan views the Trump administration's policy as an appeal to white resentment and suggests that affirmative action should be expanded to include economic status to address social mobility issues. Farzan's perspective is that affirmative action is still necessary, but it should be adjusted to be more inclusive of economic factors.
  
- Tom O’Hare believes in equal treatment and opportunity for all, suggesting that affirmative action that condescends or implies inferiority based on race is counterproductive. O’Hare's perspective is that affirmative action should be about acknowledging and encouraging potential without judging by skin color.
  
- Tom Barnard points out the inconsistency in the administration’s stance on gender versus racial diversity, suggesting a double standard. Barnard's perspective implies support for affirmative action in both gender and racial diversity, questioning the rationale behind the administration's selective acceptance of diversity criteria."	0.028700000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt	2

2	neutral	The author, Clarence Page, does not directly address his views on affirmative action in the text provided. However, he does counter Jonah Goldberg's criticism of the cliche 'Diversity is strength' by suggesting that the United States has benefited from its diverse population. This implies that Page might see value in diversity and the potential benefits of policies like affirmative action that promote inclusivity. Nonetheless, since Page does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action, we can only infer his stance to a limited extent based on his defense of diversity as a concept.	"Summary:
Clarence Page critiques Jonah Goldberg's book ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" which argues that liberals often use cliches instead of original thought in political debates. Page acknowledges that some cliches are problematic but also sees value in others, suggesting that they can encapsulate wisdom. He disagrees with Goldberg's dismissal of certain liberal cliches and offers a counter-list of conservative cliches that he finds equally annoying. Throughout the piece, Page defends the utility of some cliches and points out the hypocrisy in some of Goldberg's arguments.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While Clarence Page does not directly address his views on affirmative action in the text provided, he does mention the cliche ""Diversity is strength,"" which Goldberg criticizes. Page counters Goldberg's sarcastic remark about the NBA having quotas by highlighting that the United States has prospered from its diverse population and the ability of people to work together despite differences. This suggests that Page sees value in diversity and may view affirmative action or similar policies as beneficial in creating a more inclusive and prosperous society. However, without more specific commentary from Page on affirmative action, it's difficult to fully discern his stance on the policy."	0.02445	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes the implementation of affirmative action in elite academic institutions and how it sometimes benefits individuals who may not be the intended recipients, such as West Indian immigrants over descendants of slaves. The author is concerned with the superficial nature of diversity efforts, which focus on ethnic quotas rather than genuine inclusion of diverse experiences and perspectives. The text suggests that the author believes in the importance of diversity but disapproves of the current approach, arguing for a more substantial and meaningful strategy. The critique of affirmative action as it is currently practiced, especially in the context of Elizabeth Warren's situation, indicates that the author is somewhat against the current methods used in affirmative action but is not against the concept of diversity itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority, specifically Native American, during her academic career. Warren had claimed Native American heritage based on family stories and her grandfather's physical features, such as high cheekbones. However, the New England Genealogical Society found no firm evidence of her Cherokee ancestry. This claim led to her being cited as a minority and a ""woman of color"" by academic institutions, which has become a point of contention in her political career. The author reflects on a personal anecdote of mistakenly believing in Native American ancestry and relates it to Warren's situation. The text criticizes the academic culture that emphasizes distant ethnic connections to showcase diversity, rather than creating communities with genuinely diverse experiences and perspectives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly of how it is implemented in elite academic institutions. The author believes that the goal of creating a diverse faculty and campus is commendable, but the approach should focus on including a wide range of experiences and perspectives, not just meeting ethnic quotas. The author argues that affirmative-action programs sometimes benefit individuals like West Indian immigrants more than descendants of slaves and result in faculties with a broader range of skin tones but not necessarily a diversity of political and religious views. The author also points out the irony that Warren's background as the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma, which is atypical for Ivy League faculty, was overshadowed by her supposed Native American heritage. The author suggests that the current approach to academic diversity is not serious and will become increasingly untenable as America becomes more ethnically mixed. The controversy around Warren is seen as an opportunity for colleges and universities to rethink their strategies for achieving meaningful diversity."	0.030240000000000003	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	3
	None	The author, Drew Westen, does not explicitly state a position on affirmative action in the provided summary. The focus of the text is on presidential leadership, vision, and the influence of Reagan's ideology on American politics. While Westen does mention affirmative action in the context of the social changes of the 1960s and the backlash that Reagan capitalized on, there is no clear indication of Westen's personal stance on the policy itself. The summary discusses the broader political dynamics and strategies rather than taking a definitive position on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of a clear and compelling vision in American presidential leadership, drawing on historical examples. Franklin D. Roosevelt is praised for providing a vision of hope and recovery during the Great Depression, contrasting with the lack of vision from contemporary candidates Mitt Romney and President Obama. The author critiques the Republican narrative of small government and fiscal responsibility as hollow, given the party's history of increasing national debt. Similarly, Obama's mixed messages on stimulus and austerity are seen as lacking clarity. The author, Drew Westen, points out two main reasons for this absence of vision: the influence of money in politics, which makes candidates beholden to Wall Street, and a historical shift that began with Ronald Reagan's presidency, which prioritized deregulation and smaller government. Reagan's legacy, which has influenced both parties, is criticized for contributing to inequality and the Great Recession of 2008. Westen concludes by noting the failure of leaders to offer a vision beyond Reagan's ideology, with a nod to George H.W. Bush's dismissive attitude toward ""the vision thing.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Drew Westen, provides a critical perspective on the role of affirmative action within the broader political and social context of the United States. He suggests that affirmative action, as part of the social changes of the 1960s, was one of the factors that led to a sense of fear and anger among white working-class males who felt challenged both at home and at work. Westen notes that Ronald Reagan tapped into underlying racial and social tensions by using coded language, such as references to ""welfare queens,"" which played into the GOP's Southern strategy to gain support in the South. While Westen does not directly state his personal stance on affirmative action, he implies that the backlash against it was instrumentalized by Reagan to garner support for his broader critique of government power and to advance his political agenda. This suggests that Westen views the controversy surrounding affirmative action as part of a larger political strategy rather than as an isolated policy issue."	0.0344	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The text focuses on the integrity of Supreme Court decision-making and questions whether political considerations, such as public perception and the Court's reputation, may influence rulings on controversial issues, including affirmative action. The author expresses skepticism about the Court's ability to remain apolitical, but does not directly express a stance for or against affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion in the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius case, in which the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act was upheld as a tax. The author notes that the word ""integrity"" is absent from the 59-page opinion, yet post-decision commentary has focused heavily on Roberts's concern for the integrity, legitimacy, or reputation of the Supreme Court as a driving factor in his decision. The author questions whether Roberts, influenced by his role as Chief Justice, changed his legal judgment based on concerns about public perception and the Court's reputation, rather than strictly legal reasoning. This concern is heightened by the clarity of the dissenting opinion, which was initially the majority view supposedly supported by Roberts. The author also criticizes the perceived one-sided scrutiny of integrity, noting that liberal justices are not questioned when their decisions align with Democratic Party outcomes. The text ends by questioning whether Roberts's decision was influenced by a desire to gain political capital for future cases on divisive issues like affirmative action, gay marriage, and the Voting Rights Act.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly state the author's perspective on affirmative action, it suggests a broader concern about how political considerations may influence Supreme Court rulings on controversial issues, including affirmative action. The author implies that if Chief Justice Roberts's decision in the healthcare case was swayed by a desire to protect the Court's integrity or to gain political capital, similar motivations could affect future cases, potentially including those involving affirmative action. The text implies skepticism about the Court's ability to remain apolitical and adhere strictly to legal principles when ruling on hot-button issues. The mention of affirmative action in this context may indicate concern that decisions on such matters could be influenced by the Court's concern for its reputation rather than by the Constitution or legal precedents."	0.02987	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author, John S. Rosenberg, is critical of affirmative action policies that consider race in university admissions, labeling them as discriminatory and contradictory to American principles of equality. Rosenberg's comparison of the policy to the illogical act of destroying a village to save it, along with his disdain for the euphemistic language used to justify affirmative action, indicates a strong opposition to such policies. He believes they perpetuate a form of racial preference that is fundamentally unfair and counterproductive.	"Summary:
The text is a letter to the editor expressing the author's view on the Obama administration's stance on affirmative action in university admissions. The administration had urged the Supreme Court to permit universities to consider race as one factor in a holistic review process to promote diversity. The author criticizes this approach as being contradictory and reliant on euphemisms, arguing that it essentially promotes admission or rejection based on race or ethnicity. The author contends that the administration's argument is paradoxical; it advocates for race-based discrimination to ensure that careers are accessible to all, irrespective of race or ethnicity, which the author compares to the illogicality of destroying a village in order to save it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, John S. Rosenberg, is clearly opposed to affirmative action policies that involve race-based considerations in university admissions. Rosenberg views the policy as a form of discrimination that contradicts fundamental American principles of treating individuals without regard to race. He sees the language used by the Obama administration to justify affirmative action as a form of deception that obscures the reality of racial preference in admissions decisions. Rosenberg's perspective is that affirmative action, as it is being advocated for by the administration, undermines the principle of equality by instituting a system that favors some individuals over others based on race and ethnicity. He suggests that such policies are inherently self-defeating and irrational, as they attempt to achieve inclusivity and opportunities for all by employing methods that are exclusionary and discriminatory."	0.01935	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be critical based on the language used in the summary and the focus on Chief Justice John Roberts's skepticism. The author's choice of words such as 'racial preferences' and the highlighting of Roberts's history of conservative rulings on equality and discrimination point towards a stance that may view affirmative action as discriminatory or misaligned with the principles of true equality. While the author does not explicitly state their position, the framing of the discussion leans towards a critical perspective of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which addresses the issue of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white applicant, alleges that her rejection from the university was due to her race, as the university practices affirmative action to foster diversity. During the oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts, who had previously sided with the liberal justices in upholding ObamaCare, showed skepticism towards the university's affirmative action policy. He inquired about the definition of ""critical mass"" for minority students and questioned the transparency of the university's racial considerations in admissions. Observers like Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission suggest that despite the ObamaCare decision, Roberts is likely to side against affirmative action, as indicated by his history of conservative positions on equality and discrimination.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author appears to view affirmative action with a critical lens, especially through the lens of Chief Justice Roberts's questioning and history of rulings. The author implies that Roberts's approach to affirmative action is one of skepticism and a preference for ""true equality and ending discrimination,"" suggesting that affirmative action may not align with these principles. The author also hints at a broader conservative perspective that affirmative action policies may, in fact, constitute a form of discrimination. The use of phrases like ""racial preferences"" and the emphasis on Roberts's aggressive questioning during the oral arguments further suggest that the author may share this critical view of affirmative action."	0.02105	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of university admissions or employment, but rather draws a parallel with the Voting Rights Act's creation of majority-minority districts, which can be seen as a form of affirmative action in the political realm. The author acknowledges the historical necessity and positive outcomes of such policies, like the rise of black elected officials and the protection of black voters' rights, but also points out the negative consequences, like increased political polarization and the potential limitation of minority politicians' broader influence. The author seems to believe that while these policies were once necessary, they may no longer be suitable in their current forms and may need to be reevaluated in light of present-day circumstances. Therefore, the author's stance is nuanced and suggests a belief in the need for evolution in policies like affirmative action, rather than a wholesale endorsement or rejection.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), questioning its constitutional relevance in contemporary times. The VRA, initially designed to combat African American voter suppression, was overwhelmingly reauthorized by Congress in 2006. However, the author argues that while the VRA has been successful in ensuring black voters' rights, it has also led to unintended negative consequences such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The act has essentially mandated the creation of majority-minority districts, which has resulted in a division between liberal African American Democrats and conservative white Republicans, squeezing out moderates. Although civil rights organizations defend the act, the author suggests that the challenges to minority enfranchisement are not the same as in 1965. The author notes that minority voters no longer face the same blatant voting rights denials, as evidenced by the high turnout of black voters in the 2012 elections. The author anticipates that the Supreme Court might strike down or limit the pre-clearance provision of the VRA, citing the need for federal impositions on states to be proportional to current civil rights violations. Such a ruling could prompt a debate on how to protect voting rights while also restoring political moderation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author draws a parallel between affirmative action in universities and the creation of ""opportunity districts"" under the VRA, suggesting that both policies were implemented with good intentions to promote equality after segregation. They acknowledge that affirmative action helped build a middle class and that the VRA's opportunity districts facilitated the rise of black elected officials. However, the author also implies that these policies have had their downsides, such as contributing to political polarization and potentially limiting the political advancement of minority representatives by confining their influence to majority-minority districts. The author's stance seems to be that while these policies have been historically important, it is time to reassess their effectiveness and consequences in the context of current societal conditions."	0.03265	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author provides a factual recount of the Supreme Court justices' alignment and their voting patterns, with a specific note on the case involving the University of Texas's affirmative action plan. The author mentions Justice Ginsburg's lone dissent, indicating her support for affirmative action, but does not reveal their own stance on the issue. The summary focuses on reporting the justices' positions without injecting the author's personal opinion on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court's term revealed a significant alignment among the three female justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, who voted together at least 93% of the time, making them the most cohesive voting bloc on the Court. Their alignment is attributed to ideological similarities rather than gender, as they are recognized as the most liberal justices. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, traditionally part of the liberal wing, diverged in key privacy cases, signaling a rightward shift. The conservative justices showed a more fractured voting pattern compared to previous years. The three women justices were not only aligned in their votes but also active during Court arguments, with Ginsburg often asking the first question, Sotomayor asking the most questions, and Kagan receiving praise for the quality of her inquiries. Sotomayor gained additional visibility through her memoir and media appearances, inspiring legal professionals like Lisa S. Blatt. Despite their overall alignment, the female justices had differing views on major cases such as same-sex marriage and affirmative action, with Ginsburg dissenting alone in an affirmative action case involving the University of Texas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author notes that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor had differing opinions on affirmative action, highlighting that Ginsburg filed a lone dissent in a case that sent a challenge to the University of Texas's affirmative action plan back to the lower courts under a stricter standard. This suggests that Ginsburg was supportive of affirmative action measures, while the context implies that Sotomayor may have had a different stance, given the division among the justices. The author does not explicitly state their own perspective but provides information on the justices' positions and the complexity within the liberal wing of the Court regarding affirmative action."	0.031799999999999995	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not directly address affirmative action in the summary provided. Instead, the focus is on the reaction to racist remarks made by Donald Sterling and the broader discussion of race in America that those remarks sparked. The text includes discussions on racial progress, ongoing discrimination, and societal attitudes towards race, but does not explicitly connect these themes to affirmative action. Therefore, without a direct statement from the author regarding affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on the matter based on the information given.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reaction to the NBA commissioner's decision to issue a lifetime ban to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling after Sterling was recorded making racist remarks. South Los Angeles barbershop owner Lawrence Tolliver expressed satisfaction with Sterling's ban, hoping it would lead to Sterling selling the team. The NBA chief, Adam Silver, confirmed that Sterling admitted his voice was on the tape, where he reprimanded a friend for posting photos with black people and asked her not to bring them to the games. The barbershop's patrons discussed the incident and broader issues of race in America, noting progress but acknowledging persistent problems. They criticized Sterling's previous actions, including a housing discrimination case and a lawsuit by former Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor. The text also mentions the NAACP's retracted plan to honor Sterling and suggests his charitable donations might be more about image control than compassion. The conversation in the barbershop covered a range of topics, including the ongoing presence of racism, the impact of President Obama's election, and the need to address issues beyond Sterling's comments, such as the use of derogatory terms in popular culture and the plight of the working poor.

Author’s Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. However, the text references a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests the country may be ready to move beyond affirmative action, juxtaposed with the incident involving Donald Sterling's racist remarks. This contrast implies that while there may be a legal shift away from affirmative action, incidents like Sterling's highlight that racial issues persist in society. The author presents the perspectives of the barbershop patrons, who acknowledge racial progress in America but also recognize that much work remains to be done, indicating that issues of race are still very much present and relevant. The context suggests that while the legal landscape regarding affirmative action might be evolving, societal attitudes and behaviors, as exemplified by Sterling's comments, show that the rationale for such measures may still exist."	0.03403	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author shows a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding affirmative action, recognizing both the challenges in implementing such policies and the benefits they can bring in terms of diversity. They speak positively about the University of Texas at Austin's program, indicating a belief in the value of affirmative action when executed with careful consideration to Supreme Court guidelines. The author's call for clearer guidance from the Supreme Court suggests they are interested in seeing affirmative action continue but within a well-defined legal framework. Therefore, the author seems to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action, supporting its goals but also highlighting the need for clarity and constitutionality in its application.	"Summary:
The text discusses the affirmative-action program at the University of Texas at Austin, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and is awaiting a second review by the Supreme Court. The program includes a ""Top 10 Percent"" policy that guarantees admission to students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class, which indirectly promotes racial diversity. Additionally, the university uses a holistic review process for the remaining seats, where race can be considered as one of many factors. The text highlights the challenges of defining constitutional guidelines for affirmative action and the need for the Supreme Court to provide clarity on what constitutes a ""critical mass"" of minority students for achieving diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be cautiously supportive. They acknowledge the complexities and potential issues with government distinctions based on race but also recognize the benefits of affirmative action in promoting diversity in education. The author suggests that the University of Texas at Austin's program is a well-designed example of affirmative action that aligns with the Supreme Court's requirements for an individualized review process. Furthermore, the author points out the limitations of the ""Top 10 Percent"" policy and the need for additional measures to achieve a diverse student body. The text calls for the Supreme Court to provide clearer guidance on affirmative action policies and to affirm the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's approach to achieving diversity through its admissions process."	0.02409	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	3
	None	The provided text summary does not mention affirmative action or provide any indication of the author's stance on the topic. The summary focuses exclusively on the handling of campus rape cases and does not relate to affirmative action policies or opinions.	"Summary:
The text discusses the complexities of handling campus rape cases, particularly in the context of the case involving Paul Nungesser and Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University. Sulkowicz, who accused Nungesser of rape and was carrying a mattress around campus in protest, received considerable media attention and support from figures such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. However, when The Daily Beast published an interview with Nungesser and raised questions about Sulkowicz's story, it sparked debate about the handling of such accusations and the role of media.

The author critiques the current system in which universities handle sexual assault cases, driven by guidelines from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. These guidelines have pushed universities to use a lower standard of proof and to avoid cross-examination to protect alleged victims from re-traumatization. The result is a system that often disregards the due process rights of the accused, leading to lawsuits from male students who claim unfair treatment.

The author suggests that universities should challenge these guidelines, demand clearer definitions of sexual misconduct, and adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" to ensure fair judgment. Additionally, the author recommends that universities should work with local law enforcement to improve the handling of sexual violence cases beyond campus, instead of creating their own problematic justice systems.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The provided text does not discuss affirmative action or the author's perspective on it. The focus of the text is on the issue of campus sexual assault and the procedures used by universities to adjudicate such cases. If there is another text or specific comments by the author on affirmative action, please provide that for analysis of the author's perspective on the topic."	0.0302	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The text summary does not provide explicit details on William G. Bowen's stance on affirmative action, but it does mention that he contrasts affirmative action with issues that are not directly related to an institution's educational mission. Bowen suggests that affirmative action has a stronger claim on academia's attention than other unrelated political issues. This indicates that he views affirmative action as a relevant and significant concern for universities, which should be addressed in the context of their educational objectives. However, without a clear endorsement or critique of affirmative action policies, it's not possible to categorize his stance as either for or against. Therefore, the most accurate categorization based on the provided text would be 'neutral,' reflecting the lack of explicit support or opposition to affirmative action in the summary.	"Summary:
William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, discusses the rising trend of divestment campaigns at colleges and universities, particularly those targeting fossil fuel company holdings. Bowen outlines several arguments against divestment, such as the practical challenges of fully divesting complex investment portfolios, the potential negative impacts on endowment funds meant to support education and research, and skepticism about the effectiveness of divestment in changing corporate practices. He finds these objections generally persuasive.

Bowen is critical of the idea that universities are obligated to take a stand on every issue of broad social importance. He believes that abstaining from taking a position is legitimate and appropriate when the issue does not directly relate to an institution's educational mission, contrasting affirmative action, which is directly connected to education, with unrelated political issues.

Bowen is particularly concerned with the moral hazards of divestment, which he sees as potentially hypocritical, disrespectful to the intentions of donors, and a distraction from more effective individual political action. He also argues that institutions should prioritize improving educational outcomes and affordability over engaging in external political battles, cautioning against the trade-offs and slippery slope of using divestment as a political tool.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bowen views affirmative action as a legitimate concern for universities because it directly impacts educational processes and outcomes. He suggests that it has a stronger claim on academia's attention than issues that do not pertain to their core educational mission. From this perspective, affirmative action is seen as integral to the functioning and objectives of educational institutions, whereas other political issues, even those of significant social importance, do not necessarily warrant institutional involvement or advocacy. Bowen's stance implies that universities should be cautious in engaging with political issues, prioritizing those that are essential to their educational goals and responsibilities."	0.02977	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action within the provided text. He mentions affirmative action only in the context of discussing the potential challenges in defining hate speech and its implications for free speech. The text focuses more on the balance between free speech and hate speech rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately categorize his stance on affirmative action based on this summary.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, discusses the challenges the University of California regents face in creating a hate-speech policy. The regents are responding to recent anti-Semitic incidents but are struggling to balance the protection of free speech with the prevention of hate speech. The article highlights the difficulty in defining hate speech without infringing upon First Amendment rights, as previous attempts by universities have been struck down for being too vague. Chemerinsky suggests that universities should adopt policies that reaffirm the importance of free expression and clearly define what constitutes impermissible threats or harassment, without limiting protected speech.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky touches on affirmative action when questioning whether advocacy for affirmative action could be considered a violation of a hate-speech policy, as it could be perceived as stigmatizing racial minorities by suggesting they need preferential treatment to compete. From this context, it's evident that Chemerinsky is aware of the complexities and controversies surrounding affirmative action, including the criticism that it may inadvertently stigmatize the very groups it intends to help. However, he does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action in the text provided. Instead, he uses it as an example to illustrate the challenges in defining hate speech and the potential implications for free speech and academic discourse."	0.02423	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action but rather discusses it as part of a broader trend in politics where moral issues provide a sense of self-esteem to individuals involved in the debate. The mention of affirmative action is used to illustrate a point about the nature of political discourse rather than to argue for or against the policy itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the concept of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals engage in politics to boost their self-esteem, feeling morally superior to their opponents. This phenomenon has been observed across the political spectrum and is not unique to the rise of Donald Trump. However, Trump's campaign highlighted this trend, as his controversial statements and proposals often increased his popularity among his supporters rather than diminishing it. The author notes that national politics has shifted from primarily economic issues to moral ones, such as abortion, affirmative action, and immigration. These issues are less amenable to compromise and negotiation than economic policies. Trump's defiance of the political establishment and mainstream media is seen as empowering by his supporters, who derive ""psychic benefits"" from his stance, feeling validated and morally superior. The author suggests that this dynamic makes political compromise more difficult, as it is driven by the need for self-validation rather than practical governance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal opinion on affirmative action but includes it in a list of morally charged issues that have become central to contemporary politics. The author implies that debates over affirmative action are highly polarized, with individuals on both sides likely feeling morally superior and driven by the desire to uphold their values, which in turn provides them with self-esteem benefits. The text suggests that such issues, including affirmative action, are less likely to be resolved through compromise because they are tied to deeply held moral beliefs and the politics of self-esteem, making them more contentious and divisive."	0.026000000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not clear from the text provided. The text summarizes various events and includes the mention of the Supreme Court focusing on cases related to affirmative action, but there is no explicit indication of the author's stance on the issue. The mention of affirmative action is merely descriptive, indicating it as one of the topics the Supreme Court was set to address, without offering any personal viewpoint or analysis.	"Summary:
The text provided offers a snapshot of various significant events and issues in the United States and abroad during a particular period. Key points include:

- The Supreme Court's announcement to make documents available online by 2016.
- The terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris, killing 12 people, including four cartoonists, raising questions about the limits of free speech and satire.

- Disagreements between President Obama and President Putin at the UN regarding the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.
- The Supreme Court's new term focusing on cases related to abortion, religious rights, and affirmative action.
- Media inconsistency in labeling attackers in the United States as either gunmen or terrorists.
- Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslim immigrants from entering the US after the San Bernardino attacks.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly provide their perspective on affirmative action. However, they mention that the Supreme Court began a new term with cases that included affirmative action, suggesting that it was a significant issue at the time. The inclusion of Justice Anthony Kennedy's name implies that his views or decisions were particularly influential in cases regarding affirmative action. Without further context, it's not possible to determine the author's stance on the matter."	0.02447	affirmative action	txt/1752156404.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, demonstrates a clear advocacy for expanding the scope of affirmative action to include low-income students. Levy's critique of the current college admissions system, which he sees as favoring wealthy students, and his proposal for a 'poverty preference' indicate that he is in favor of using affirmative action as a means to address economic disparities. His argument does not solely rest on race or ethnicity but extends to economic status, suggesting an inclusive approach to affirmative action that aims to level the playing field for disadvantaged students. Levy's perspective shows that he is not neutral or against affirmative action; rather, he is in favor of reforming it to better serve low-income students and to ensure that merit is fairly assessed in the context of an individual's opportunities and challenges.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of the New York City schools, discusses the significant disparities in college admissions for low-income students at the most selective colleges. He points out that a mere 3 percent of students at these colleges come from the bottom 25 percent in terms of income, while 72 percent come from the wealthiest quartile. Despite facing numerous obstacles, low-income students who do gain admission to elite schools perform just as well as their wealthier counterparts. Levy criticizes the existing advantages that wealthy students have, such as legacy admissions, preferences in less diverse sports, and access to better test preparation. He also notes the barriers that low-income students face, including the inability to apply early due to financial uncertainties and inadequate college counseling in public schools. Levy advocates for a ""poverty preference"" in admissions, which would function as affirmative action for low-income students, arguing that it would not only level the playing field but also help maintain ethnic diversity in the face of potential changes to race-conscious affirmative action policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy supports the idea of affirmative action, but he argues that it should be expanded to specifically include low-income students, regardless of their race or ethnicity. He criticizes the current system as being an ""affirmative action for the wealthy"" due to legacy admissions and other preferences that disproportionately benefit affluent students. Levy believes that giving more credit to the achievements of low-income students, who have succeeded despite fewer resources, would be a fairer measure of merit and would help to correct systemic inequalities in the college admissions process. He suggests that this approach to affirmative action would also indirectly support ethnic diversity, especially if race-conscious affirmative action is limited or eliminated by the Supreme Court. Overall, Levy's perspective is that affirmative action should be a tool to promote equal opportunity for academically qualified students from all economic backgrounds."	0.03148	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The authors acknowledge the concept of affirmative action and its evolution from a remedy for historical discrimination to a tool for promoting diversity in universities. They argue for the inclusion of more conservative voices in academia to enhance ideological diversity and to foster civil discourse. However, they specifically do not endorse the use of affirmative action policies for this purpose. Instead, they propose alternative methods such as inviting conservative speakers, considering hiring preferences, and experimenting with visiting appointments. Their perspective on affirmative action is nuanced—they see value in the goal of diversity but do not support affirmative action as the means to achieve ideological balance in academia.	"Summary:
The authors, both conservative professors, acknowledge that while they have defended universities against conservative critiques, they also recognize that academia, particularly in the social sciences, exhibits a political bias against conservatives. They cite studies showing the underrepresentation of conservative professors in the social sciences compared to other fields and suggest that conservative students avoid social science majors and feel uncomfortable in politically charged academic environments. They note that economics is an exception, with a more balanced representation of political affiliations. The authors argue that the lack of political diversity undermines the university's role in fostering civil discourse and pursuing truth, as homogeneity can lead to confirmation bias and a narrower scope of research. They advocate for increasing conservative representation in academia, not through affirmative action in admissions and hiring, but by inviting conservative speakers, considering hiring preferences, advertising positions in fields that may attract conservatives, and experimenting with visiting appointments in conservative thought.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors reference the concept of affirmative action, traditionally intended to remedy historical discrimination, but point out that universities have shifted towards a diversity rationale, even applying affirmative action to male students to prevent gender imbalance. They suggest that if the goal of affirmative action is to increase the variety of perspectives (as Justice Powell indicated in the Bakke case), then efforts should be made to include more conservative voices in academia. However, the authors clarify that they do not endorse affirmative action for graduate admissions and hiring. Instead, they propose other methods to encourage ideological diversity, such as more inclusive speaker policies and targeted job postings. They believe that increasing conservative representation would enhance the university's public legitimacy and deepen its commitment to diversity and truth-seeking."	0.03053	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed through a supportive tone towards the Supreme Court's decision to uphold race-conscious admissions policies. The author appreciates the role of affirmative action in achieving diversity in educational institutions and criticizes the opposition, represented by figures like Justices Thomas and Alito, as being out of step with the realities of racial dynamics in the United States. The author's commendation of Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, which is seen as a departure from his previous skepticism, further underscores the author's approval of affirmative action policies. The text clearly indicates that the author believes affirmative action is essential for reflecting the diversity of America in educational settings and dismisses the idea that society is already colorblind, suggesting that the author is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court has reaffirmed the constitutionality of considering race in university admissions in a 4 to 3 ruling, supporting the University of Texas at Austin's admission policies. The University of Texas uses a top 10 percent rule for three-quarters of its admissions, which indirectly increases diversity due to the segregated nature of Texas high schools. The remaining spots are filled through a holistic review that includes race as one among many factors. Justice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, emphasized the importance of universities being able to define the intangible qualities that contribute to their educational mission, like diversity. The decision was seen as a strong affirmation of affirmative action in higher education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive and sees it as essential for achieving a diverse student body in universities. The author views the Supreme Court's decision as a necessary step in maintaining the constitutionality and effectiveness of race-conscious admissions policies. The author acknowledges the challenges and constant attacks that affirmative action has faced, particularly highlighting Abigail Fisher's case as an example of such opposition. The author is critical of justices like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who oppose the consideration of race in admissions and suggests that their arguments are out of touch with the reality of America's racial dynamics. The author commends Justice Kennedy for his decision, which is portrayed as a departure from his previous skepticism of affirmative-action programs. The author appears to advocate for the continued use of affirmative action as a means to create a student body that reflects the diversity of today's America, rejecting the notion that the country is already colorblind or that ending race-conscious policies would lead to a colorblind society."	0.0287	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	Marilynne Rudick expresses a critical stance on the application of affirmative action within the specific context of medical marijuana licensing in Maryland. It is important to note that her criticism is focused on the perceived misapplication of affirmative action principles in a context where she believes they are causing delays and diverting attention from the primary goal of providing medical assistance. Her frustration is with the process and its impact on patient access to medical marijuana, rather than with the principle of affirmative action in a broader sense. Therefore, it is not entirely clear if she is against affirmative action in general or just its implementation in this specific case.	"Summary:
Marilynne Rudick expresses frustration over the ongoing controversy regarding the distribution of licenses for growing medical marijuana in Maryland, emphasizing that the process is taking too long and has deviated from its original purpose. Rudick, who has multiple sclerosis and could benefit from medical marijuana, is indifferent to the specifics of who grows the marijuana or where it is grown. She criticizes Maryland politicians for treating the medical marijuana program like an economic development or affirmative action initiative, rather than focusing on the urgent need to provide access to the drug for patients who need it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Marilynne Rudick, appears to hold a critical view of affirmative action in the context of the medical marijuana licensing process in Maryland. Rudick suggests that affirmative action considerations are inappropriate in this context and that they are contributing to unnecessary delays in making medical marijuana available to patients. Her perspective is that the medical marijuana program should strictly serve its intended medical purpose and not be entangled with other objectives such as economic development or social policy initiatives like affirmative action."	0.015629999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text. The focus is on the importance of understanding Judge Neil Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and how his originalist approach might affect Supreme Court decisions on various progressive issues, potentially including affirmative action. The text implies a concern for how Gorsuch's interpretations of the Constitution will deal with modern societal changes, but it does not explicitly state the author's stance on affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated by President Trump to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. The article suggests that instead of partisan posturing, the hearings should focus on a serious discussion about Gorsuch's views on the Constitution, the role of precedent, and how the court should adapt to societal and scientific changes. It acknowledges the frustration Democrats feel over the GOP's handling of Merrick Garland's nomination by President Obama, but it emphasizes the importance of understanding Gorsuch's approach to being a Supreme Court justice, especially given his potential long-term impact on the court. The article describes Gorsuch as an ""originalist,"" like Scalia, and questions how this philosophy might affect his interpretations of the Constitution, particularly in relation to modern issues unforeseen by the framers. The text also raises concerns about whether Gorsuch would respect court precedents on contentious issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a perspective on affirmative action within this text. However, the author does raise concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, which includes affirmative action among other issues. The text implies that understanding Gorsuch's judicial philosophy is crucial, as it could influence how the court deals with affirmative action and other rights. The emphasis is on the potential long-term implications of Gorsuch's originalist views and whether they will allow the court to continue adapting to societal changes, which could include the evolution of affirmative action policies. The author's perspective seems to advocate for a thorough examination of Gorsuch's views to ensure they align with a modern, evolving interpretation of the Constitution that can address contemporary issues like affirmative action."	0.03145	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action. Instead, the text uses an instance involving affirmative action (Proposition 209) to illustrate a broader point about potential political bias in ballot language. The reference to affirmative action is purely contextual and serves to support the main argument about the importance of nonpartisan wording in ballot initiatives. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not discussed or revealed in the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of wording in ballot initiatives, highlighting a lawsuit filed by Republicans against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. They allege that Becerra, a Democrat, used partisan language in the title of their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees, which they believe could weaken support for the measure. The title, they argue, is clunky and avoids straightforward language. The article notes that this is a common issue when an attorney general from one political party prepares language for a ballot initiative promoted by the opposing party. Past attorneys general, including Dan Lungren, Kamala Harris, and Jerry Brown, have faced similar accusations of bias. The text suggests a solution: assigning the task of writing ballot titles and summaries to a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO). Though a proposal to this effect died in committee, the idea is supported by organizations like California Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of California.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author refers to a historical instance where former Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for not including the term ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209, a measure that sought to end state affirmative action programs in 1996. This reference is used to illustrate the broader point that attorneys general may choose or omit words in ballot titles or summaries to influence voter perception. The author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action but uses the issue to underline the potential for political bias in the language used on ballots. The focus of the text is on the importance of impartial and clear language in ballot initiatives rather than on the merits or demerits of affirmative action itself."	0.02674	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Bari A. Williams, is concerned about the tech industry potentially redefining diversity to emphasize cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity, which could undermine the goals of affirmative action. Williams stresses the importance of continuing to focus on increasing the representation of historically underrepresented groups, such as blacks, Latinos, and women, in the tech industry. The author's argument that identity diversity should not be replaced by cognitive diversity suggests a belief in the necessity of affirmative action to correct imbalances and promote inclusion.	"Summary:
Denise Young Smith, Apple's vice president of diversity and inclusion, sparked controversy with a statement suggesting that a group of white men can be diverse if they have different life experiences and perspectives. After a backlash, she clarified her comments, emphasizing that diversity includes all underrepresented minorities. The author, Bari A. Williams, expresses concern that the tech industry is shifting its focus from race and gender diversity to ""cognitive diversity,"" a trend that could undermine efforts to address the lack of representation of blacks, Latinos, and women in tech. This shift is seen as a way to sidestep the challenge of increasing the number of underrepresented groups in tech. Williams argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not replace the efforts to increase identity diversity. The author hopes the industry will not abandon its commitment to increasing racial and gender diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Bari A. Williams, views affirmative action as a necessary measure to address the significant underrepresentation of certain racial and gender groups in the tech industry. She is concerned that the concept of diversity is being diluted to prioritize cognitive or viewpoint diversity over race and gender diversity. Williams suggests that this redefinition allows companies to claim diversity without making real changes to include more women, blacks, and Latinos in their ranks. She believes that the original intent of affirmative action—to increase the representation of historically marginalized groups—should not be forgotten or replaced by a focus on cognitive diversity alone. Williams argues that identity diversity is crucial for the tech industry and that efforts to increase it should not be diminished or overlooked in favor of other types of diversity."	0.03846	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Ibram X. Kendi, does not directly address affirmative action in the provided text. However, Kendi's critique of denial and resistance to acknowledging racism suggests that he would support measures like affirmative action that aim to address systemic inequalities. He criticizes those who resist such policies and implies that their opposition is often rooted in unacknowledged racist attitudes. Kendi's emphasis on confronting and confessing racism indicates that he would likely be in favor of affirmative action as a tool for promoting racial justice.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece by Ibram X. Kendi discussing the pervasive issue of racism in America and the common practice of denial that accompanies it. Kendi argues that denial is a defense mechanism used to protect a superior sense of self and to maintain the false notion of American superiority. He points to President Trump's alleged derogatory comments about African countries as an example of overt racism that is often denied by his supporters and overlooked by his opponents, who also deny their own racism. Kendi traces this denial through American presidential history, highlighting the racism of past presidents, including those who owned slaves and others who held racist views despite being seen as champions of racial progress. He suggests that Richard Nixon's political strategy capitalized on this denial by appealing to racist sentiments without overtly acknowledging them. Kendi criticizes the use of coded language that allows individuals to deny racism, and expresses frustration with those who oppose Trump yet deny the presence of racism in their own actions or beliefs. He concludes that being a racist is not an identity but a reflection of one's words and actions, and that true anti-racism requires a willingness to confess and confront racism rather than deny it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus specifically on affirmative action, the author's perspective on the subject can be inferred from his broader discussion on racism and denial. Kendi criticizes those who resist affirmative action policies, suggesting that such resistance is part of a pattern of denying racism. He implies that opposition to affirmative action is often rooted in racist attitudes that are not acknowledged as such. Kendi's view is that acknowledging and confronting racism is essential, which would likely extend to supporting affirmative action as a means to address systemic inequalities and promote racial justice. He is critical of those who label affirmative action as ""reverse discrimination,"" viewing this as part of the vocabulary used to deny the existence of racism and maintain the status quo."	0.03665	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text as they do not explicitly state their position on the matter. The text discusses the author's views on the debate surrounding gun control and mentions affirmative action only in a broader context of cultural shifts and societal norms. The author's concern seems to focus on the silencing of dissent and the impact of cultural forces on open debate, rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action without further information.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the debate surrounding gun control, initially believing that while public support for moderate gun restrictions is high, legislative action is unlikely due to Republican control of most legislatures and the influence of the NRA. They suggest that to enact gun laws, it is necessary to depolarize the issue and show respect to gun owners. However, the author observes that the approach taken by gun control advocates has been highly polarizing, with left-wing groups supporting the students from Parkland and using extreme rhetoric. This has led to legislative defeats for gun control measures. Despite this, the author acknowledges a broader cultural shift where progressives may be succeeding in delegitimizing their opponents, not just on gun control but on various social issues, thereby influencing societal norms beyond legislation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express their own views on affirmative action within the provided text. However, they do mention it in the context of discussing a broader cultural and political shift. The author notes that certain opinions, such as opposition to affirmative action, have become socially unacceptable in elite circles and can have career-ending consequences. This inclusion suggests the author is concerned about the silencing of dissent and the imposition of a particular set of values by cultural elites, which may be indicative of a broader concern about the suppression of open debate and intellectual diversity. The author warns that such cultural victories achieved through intimidation rather than persuasion could lead to a backlash, and they caution progressives about the potential consequences of excluding a significant portion of the population from ""respectable society."""	0.028310000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author is skeptical about the use of affirmative action in the context of Stuyvesant High School admissions, emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system that rewards hard work and determination. The author is critical of Mayor de Blasio's plan to change the admissions process to achieve racial balance, suggesting that it would undermine the principles of fairness and the American dream. The author's concern about the potential disadvantages to poor Asian American families who have worked hard within the current system indicates a position that is somewhat against affirmative action, at least in the specific case of Stuyvesant High School.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Stuyvesant High School in New York City, an elite public school with a majority Asian American student body. The author contrasts the school's demographics with the overall composition of New York's public school students, noting that blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented at Stuyvesant. Mayor Bill de Blasio views this as an injustice and seeks to change the admissions system, which is currently based solely on an entrance exam. The author mentions President Trump's base, which feels marginalized by liberal policies, to underscore the irony of de Blasio's proposal, which aims to alter what is perceived as a color-blind system. The author argues that many Asian American students at Stuyvesant come from poor families who have sacrificed to prepare their children for the admissions test. The author expresses limited tolerance for affirmative action and opposes the mayor's plan to reserve slots for students who nearly pass the exam, fearing it will undermine a system that rewards hard work and determination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is skeptical, particularly in the context of Stuyvesant High School. The author believes that affirmative action should not be used to disadvantage students who have earned their place through hard work and adherence to the rules, especially when those students come from poor backgrounds. The author views the current merit-based system, which relies solely on an entrance exam, as fair and equitable. The suggestion that Mayor de Blasio's plan to alter the admissions process to achieve a racial balance undermines the American dream and the principle that hard work and merit should be rewarded, regardless of race or ethnicity. The author is critical of efforts to dismantle a system that has allowed many poor students, particularly Asian Americans, to advance socioeconomically."	0.029400000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, David Leonhardt, appears to view affirmative action as a less advantageous issue for Democrats to emphasize in their midterm campaign strategy. His focus on the importance of choosing issues that resonate with the majority of the electorate and have a strong public opinion advantage suggests that he sees affirmative action as a potentially divisive or less universally supported issue. He does not explicitly express his personal support or opposition to affirmative action, but rather discusses it from a strategic electoral perspective, indicating a neutral stance on the matter itself while recognizing its potential political implications.	"Summary:
David Leonhardt's op-ed discusses the Democratic response to President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee. He advises Democrats to be realistic about the nominee's likely confirmation due to the Republican majority in the Senate, not to lose hope, and to focus on their strengths. Leonhardt suggests that Democrats should use the confirmation process as a wake-up call to build a stronger grassroots movement and focus on winning local, state, and congressional elections. He emphasizes that while the Supreme Court may lean conservative, progressives can still achieve victories by winning elections and influencing legislation. He advises against making social issues like abortion and affirmative action central to the midterm campaign, as public opinion is not as left-leaning as some may believe. Instead, he recommends focusing on issues where Democrats have a strong public opinion advantage, such as health insurance, taxation, and government corruption.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Leonhardt's perspective on affirmative action, as gleaned from the text, appears to be that while it is an issue that inspires liberal passion, it may not be strategically advantageous for Democrats to focus on it during the midterm campaign. He implies that affirmative action, along with other social issues, does not resonate with the majority of the electorate in the same way that other issues like health insurance and taxation do. Leonhardt suggests that Democrats should be aware of the country's political climate and not overestimate the public's support for left-leaning policies, including affirmative action. His stance is pragmatic, prioritizing electoral strategy over ideological battles in the context of the midterm elections."	0.02785	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses initial commendation for Pete Wilson's early efforts to implement affirmative-action hiring practices, suggesting a belief in the value of affirmative action to address racial injustices. However, the author criticizes Wilson's later actions to eliminate affirmative action, indicating that the author sees affirmative action as a positive force for social mobility and racial justice, and views Wilson's reversal as detrimental. The author's critique of Wilson's attempt to dismantle affirmative action, along with the acknowledgment of its benefits for minorities, implies that the author is in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the career of former California Governor Pete Wilson, who is turning 85. The author thanks Wilson for his 30-plus years of public service, which included stints as an assemblyman, mayor of San Diego, U.S. senator, and governor. The author acknowledges Wilson's moderate political approach and his early efforts to protect the environment, implement affirmative-action hiring practices, and address racial injustices, such as co-sponsoring the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. However, the author also criticizes Wilson for later actions that contradicted his previous centrist record, such as deregulating California's electricity, signing three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted immigrants in the country illegally. The author argues that these actions had negative consequences but also galvanized Latino and immigrant communities to become more politically active and aware of their identities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of Pete Wilson's stance on affirmative action. Initially, the author commends Wilson for implementing affirmative-action hiring practices as the mayor of San Diego, acknowledging his belief in the need to alleviate the problems caused by inadequate housing, education, and job opportunities for America's minorities. This suggests that the author sees value in affirmative action as a tool for addressing historical disadvantages faced by minority groups.

However, the author later criticizes Wilson for his ""180-degree turn"" on the issue, noting that as governor, Wilson worked hard to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California and beyond. The author implies that affirmative action was instrumental in helping thousands of minorities enter the middle class, and Wilson's reversal on the issue radicalized college students. Through this critique, the author indicates a belief that affirmative action had been a positive force for social mobility and racial justice, and that Wilson's efforts to dismantle it were detrimental to those causes.

Overall, the author appears to support affirmative action and views Wilson's eventual opposition to it as a betrayal of his earlier, more moderate and inclusive political positions."	0.03292	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The text summary does not provide explicit details on Erwin Chemerinsky's stance on affirmative action; rather, it focuses on his critique of the analogy comparing Supreme Court justices to umpires and the role of justices' discretion in interpreting the law. While Chemerinsky discusses how constitutional cases involve value choices and personal ideologies, particularly in the context of affirmative action, there is no clear indication of his personal support for or opposition to affirmative action policies. The summary suggests that he recognizes the subjectivity and complexity involved in constitutional interpretations of such policies but does not explicitly state his position for or against them.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky critiques the analogy used by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who likened justices to ""umpires."" Chemerinsky argues that unlike umpires, who apply pre-existing rules with little room for interpretation, Supreme Court justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law, as the Constitution is written in broad language that often requires interpretation. He gives examples of how the Supreme Court's decisions on issues like campaign spending, gun rights, and search and seizure are influenced by the justices' ideologies and life experiences. Chemerinsky asserts that constitutional cases often involve value choices that cannot be resolved by the text of the Constitution alone, highlighting the contentious nature of Supreme Court confirmations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, is that it involves a constitutional question about whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. He suggests that determining what constitutes a ""compelling,"" ""important,"" or ""legitimate"" government interest is a matter of value judgment that goes beyond the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. This indicates that Chemerinsky views the debate on affirmative action as one that hinges on the justices' personal ideologies and interpretations of what goals are sufficiently important to justify government policies. He seems to advocate for a recognition of the inherent subjectivity in such constitutional determinations, as opposed to presenting them as straightforward legal decisions that can be made without reference to personal or policy preferences."	0.02663	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary. The text provides an overview of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate hearing and mentions concerns raised by women's rights advocates over his refusal to comment on key issues like abortion and affirmative action. However, the author does not offer a personal viewpoint on affirmative action, focusing instead on reporting Kavanaugh's perceived positions and the reactions of others. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was marked by sharp partisan divides and accusations of political grandstanding. Democrats attempted to halt proceedings due to withheld documents, while Republicans accused them of theatrics. Kavanaugh, a highly qualified conservative judge, was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican support. The contentious nature of the hearing was likened to Clarence Thomas's in 1991. Critics noted a trend of nominees revealing less about their views, with Kavanaugh providing even fewer substantive answers than his predecessors. The decline in bipartisan support for nominees was highlighted, with historical votes for comparison. Senators seek a ""neutral"" judge, but actions, such as blocking Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, suggest otherwise. Conservative scholars praised Kavanaugh, while women's rights advocates expressed concern over his refusal to comment on key issues like abortion and affirmative action. Kavanaugh's stance on same-sex marriage was ambiguous, and while the court is not looking to revisit that issue, abortion remains contentious.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Kavanaugh's perspective on affirmative action, noting a contrast between his public praise for the landmark desegregation ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education and his private memos criticizing affirmative action policies. Kavanaugh's use of terms like ""naked racial set-aside"" and ""racial spoils system"" in reference to race-conscious measures intended to address systemic racism is highlighted as upsetting by Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. This indicates that the author perceives Kavanaugh's stance on affirmative action as potentially regressive and at odds with efforts to combat entrenched racial inequalities."	0.03476	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The text provided does not directly relate to the typical discourse surrounding affirmative action, which often pertains to policies designed to address historical injustices and discrimination in areas like employment or education. Instead, the text references a form of humanitarian action regarding immigration policy. Pierre Bertrand's positive view on Angela Merkel's refugee policy suggests he might be somewhat in favor of affirmative action in a broad, humanitarian sense. However, since affirmative action is not discussed in its more common context by the authors, and the other authors do not address the concept, it is not possible to accurately categorize their stances on affirmative action as it is traditionally understood.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss Hillary Clinton's statements on Europe's immigration policy and the broader implications of her stance. Pierre Bertrand, a former UNHCR official, criticizes Clinton for seemingly endorsing policies that contradict the humanitarian spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly in light of her previous support for Angela Merkel's welcoming approach to Syrian refugees. Lorna Salzman praises Clinton for recognizing the political consequences of uncontrolled migration in Europe, which she believes has fueled the rise of right-wing populism due to cultural differences between Europeans and refugees. Jane Carey argues that the focus on immigration is misplaced and that the real issues—the West's involvement in foreign conflicts and climate change—must be addressed to stem the flow of refugees.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The term ""affirmative action"" is only explicitly mentioned in Pierre Bertrand's letter, where it refers to Angela Merkel's policy of welcoming Syrian refugees into Germany. Bertrand seems to view affirmative action positively in this humanitarian context, as he praises Merkel's actions and criticizes Clinton for not consistently supporting such measures. However, since the term is not used in the other letters or discussed in relation to other forms of affirmative action, such as policies aimed at correcting racial or gender disparities, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive analysis of the authors' perspectives on affirmative action in general. The context provided suggests that Bertrand supports affirmative action in the sense of proactive measures to help refugees, while the other authors do not address the concept directly."	0.02388	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of affirmative action policies, highlighting their failure to adequately serve the underprivileged, their tendency to benefit the already well-off, and their contribution to increased ethnic tensions. The author also questions the effectiveness of these policies by citing examples where the removal of affirmative action appears to have led to better outcomes, such as at the University of California. This critique implies a stance that is skeptical of affirmative action's current implementation and effectiveness.	"Summary:
The text discusses the protests in Malaysia and the United States regarding affirmative action policies. In Malaysia, 55,000 people gathered in Kuala Lumpur to support race-based policies favoring the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These policies, which include preferential treatment in education, housing, government jobs, and business opportunities, were intended to create racial balance but have been criticized for benefiting the wealthy Malays and exacerbating ethnic tensions. The policies were supposed to end in 1991 but have been extended for political reasons.

The author compares the situation in Malaysia to the affirmative action debate in the U.S., where policies are also said to benefit the already well-off and stir racial tensions. Instances such as Harvard's lawsuit for discrimination against Asian applicants and New York's controversy over admissions to elite public schools are cited. The author questions the effectiveness of affirmative action in both countries, noting that the intended beneficiaries have not significantly progressed and that other factors may have contributed to any advancements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They argue that affirmative action policies, both in Malaysia and the U.S., have not effectively served their intended purpose of helping the underprivileged. Instead, the author suggests that these policies often benefit those who are already well-off and fail to address the root causes of inequality. The author also points out that such policies can increase ethnic tensions and that economic progress among the targeted groups may be attributed to other factors, rather than affirmative action itself.

The author further supports their criticism by presenting examples where the removal of affirmative action led to better outcomes, such as the increased enrollment and graduation rates of blacks in more challenging fields at the University of California after race-based admissions were ended. The author implies that affirmative action policies are sometimes counterproductive and that alternative approaches may be more effective in achieving equality and economic progress for disadvantaged groups."	0.02917	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	3
	None	The author, Jacob Weisberg, does not express a personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The focus of the article is on Daniel Patrick Moynihan's career and his views on affirmative action, rather than Weisberg's own opinions. Weisberg recounts Moynihan's support for affirmative action without offering a critique or endorsement, which indicates that the article is not concerned with taking a position on the policy itself but rather with discussing Moynihan's intellectual legacy and political career.	"Summary:
This article by Jacob Weisberg provides a critical analysis of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's career as a U.S. Senator and intellectual figure in American politics. It discusses Moynihan's complex legacy, highlighting his intellectual contributions, his failure to enact major legislation, and his strained relationship with the Clinton administration. The text recounts Moynihan's career trajectory, including his role in various presidential administrations, his contributions to the development of social policy, and his time in the Senate. It notes his involvement in significant historical moments, such as the creation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and his controversial report on the black family in 1965. The article also touches on Moynihan's personal traits, such as his drinking habits and temperament, which may have affected his political effectiveness. Weisberg ultimately portrays Moynihan as a brilliant but flawed figure whose critical intelligence often hampered his ability to be an effective politician.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jacob Weisberg, does not directly state his own perspective on affirmative action within the text provided. However, he does reference Daniel Patrick Moynihan's support for affirmative action as part of a range of policies designed to address the crisis in the structure of the black family. Moynihan believed that affirmative action and other supportive measures were necessary to enhance the stability and resources of black American families. The author recounts that Moynihan's report on the black family, which called for national action and included support for affirmative action, was initially met with hostility and accusations of racism. Despite this, Moynihan's insights into the importance of family structure in the pursuit of racial equality were later acknowledged as prescient. Weisberg's recounting of these events suggests an understanding of the complexity of affirmative action and the contentious nature of its discussion during Moynihan's career."	0.11699000000000001	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's personal stance on affirmative action is not clearly outlined in the summary provided. The text discusses the college admissions scandal and the resulting debates over affirmative action without explicitly stating the author's own perspective. The author mentions arguments from both opponents and defenders of affirmative action but does not seem to take a definitive side. Instead, the author focuses on presenting the broader context of divisive rhetoric and the impact of wealth in college admissions, as well as the political discourse surrounding these issues.	"Summary:
The text discusses various instances where President Trump and others have been accused of amplifying divisive rhetoric, particularly around issues of race, religion, and class. It mentions Trump's support for Jeanine Pirro after her comments about Rep. Omar's hijab, his disparaging remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, and his rhetoric that has been criticized in the context of the Christchurch, New Zealand shooting. The text also touches on the college admissions scandal, which has reignited debates over affirmative action, with opponents arguing that the scandal undermines trust in the impartiality of elite colleges' admissions processes, and defenders highlighting that wealth plays a larger role in admissions than race. Sen. Amy Klobuchar criticizes Trump for amplifying racial and religious hatred, and the text notes that Fox News, specifically Chris Wallace, has been careful to blame the Christchurch shooting on the terrorist alone but acknowledges Trump's history of stoking similar sentiments. It also mentions an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker's controversial response to the New Zealand shootings and Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege while also pointing out that other candidates, like Julian Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris, also have relevant perspectives on border issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a debate on affirmative action in the context of the college admissions scandal. The scandal has led to renewed discussions about the fairness and integrity of the college admissions process. The author indicates that opponents of affirmative action feel vindicated by the scandal, believing it demonstrates that elite colleges cannot be trusted to fairly assess applicants. Conversely, defenders of affirmative action argue that the scandal highlights the influence of wealth in college admissions, suggesting that the system is more biased in favor of the wealthy than against any racial group. The author seems to suggest that the scandal has amplified the issues of class and race in college admissions, although the author's personal stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided."	0.02511	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, discusses the challenges she faces as an African-American woman in academia, including biases and assumptions about her qualifications. While she does not explicitly state her stance on affirmative action, she acknowledges the negative stereotypes associated with it and the undermining of its legitimacy. She also notes that she did not benefit from affirmative action, distancing her achievements from the policy. Nevertheless, her emphasis on inspiring diversity in her field and her acknowledgment of the biases that minority individuals face in academia suggest that she recognizes the need for policies that promote diversity and counteract discrimination. Her stance is not explicitly stated, but her acknowledgment of the challenges faced by underrepresented groups and her role in changing perceptions implies a level of support for the objectives of affirmative action, albeit with an awareness of the stigma that can be attached to its beneficiaries.	"Summary:
The author, Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, discusses the importance of titles in academia, especially for women and people of color. She insists on being called ""Dr. Berry"" in the classroom to establish respect and authority, which she believes is not automatically afforded to her due to her gender and race. Berry shares experiences where her qualifications and teaching methods have been questioned by students, something she attributes to biases against her minority status. Despite the expectation of progressive attitudes in higher education, she points out the underrepresentation of African-American women in engineering faculties and emphasizes her role in changing perceptions and inspiring diversity in the field.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. She acknowledges that anti-affirmative-action ideologues have been successful in undermining the policy's legitimacy and, as a consequence, have tarnished the reputations of those who might have benefited from it. Berry expresses frustration that some people assume she is less qualified than her white male colleagues and may have been hired to fulfill a ""double minority quota."" She also hints at the negative impact these assumptions have on her professional interactions, as she feels the need to prove herself more than her peers. However, it is important to note that she clarifies she did not personally benefit from affirmative action, suggesting that her achievements are the result of her own merit. Despite the challenges, Berry is determined to maintain professionalism and use her position to inspire and encourage diversity in the engineering field."	0.02969	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective is characterized by approval of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action policy, describing it as a 'prime example' and 'conscientiously designed.' The support is evident in the positive language used to describe the policy and the hope expressed that the Supreme Court will affirm its legitimacy. This suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action policies that aim to achieve diversity in educational institutions.	"Summary:
The New York Times editorial discusses a Senate bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that aims to end the bulk collection of Americans' phone records and increase transparency in intelligence agencies. The bill would also establish a panel to advocate for privacy rights and require public summaries of court decisions affecting those rights. The Washington Post editorial approves of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action admissions policy, which complements the race-neutral top 10 percent program with a holistic review process. The Boston Globe addresses Massachusetts' revised 'buffer-zone' law for abortion clinics, responding to Supreme Court objections. The Guardian praises Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, for focusing on wage growth in addition to employment. The Globe and Mail reports on the progress made in combating colony collapse disorder among honeybees. Lastly, The Korea Herald criticizes Japan's denial of wartime sex slavery and calls for the government to acknowledge and apologize for its past actions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as presented in the editorial from The Washington Post, is supportive. The editorial views the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action admissions policy favorably, describing it as ""a prime example"" of a policy that should withstand judicial scrutiny. The policy is seen as ""conscientiously designed"" to achieve diversity in a way that complements the race-neutral top 10 percent program. The author suggests that when the case returns to the Supreme Court, the justices should affirm the legitimacy and permissibility of U.T. Austin's approach to affirmative action."	0.027499999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The authors collectively argue against the mismatch theory and provide evidence that affirmative action benefits minority students by allowing them access to more selective universities, which they believe leads to better outcomes. They emphasize the necessity of affirmative action due to systemic racism and societal inequalities. The authors advocate for its continuation and critique the foundations of arguments against affirmative action, such as the mismatch theory. They also underscore the success of historically black colleges and suggest the need for an inclusive institutional climate. Their arguments are in support of affirmative action and against theories that undermine its effectiveness.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss the concept of ""mismatch"" in affirmative action policies, the necessity of affirmative action in society, and the impact of systemic racism on educational opportunities. William Kidder criticizes the mismatch theory, which suggests affirmative action harms minority students by placing them in schools where they may be unqualified. He points out flaws in the research supporting this theory and highlights evidence that attending more selective universities benefits minority students. Rosiland Jordan argues that affirmative action is essential due to societal valuation of degrees from certain institutions and the existing inequalities in the education system. Jane McAlevey emphasizes that affirmative action should continue until a better solution to combat racism is found and proven effective. Randal Maurice Jelks critiques the foundations of mismatch theory and underscores the success of historically black colleges in educating black students.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The authors express a supportive perspective on affirmative action. They believe that it is a necessary measure to counteract systemic inequalities and persistent racism in society. They argue against the mismatch theory and suggest that affirmative action provides educational opportunities that lead to positive outcomes for minority students. The authors advocate for the continuation and expansion of affirmative action policies until more equitable solutions are implemented. They also highlight the importance of creating an inclusive institutional climate that fosters the success of all students, regardless of their racial or ethnic backgrounds."	0.023100000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's presentation of affirmative action in a positive light, noting it as a significant achievement of Nixon's administration, suggests a favorable view of the policy. The inclusion of affirmative action alongside other progressive reforms indicates that the author sees it as a constructive and beneficial part of social progress. There is no indication of any negative sentiment towards affirmative action in the text provided.	"Summary:
The text is an opinion piece that critiques President Obama's negotiation strategy during the debt ceiling agreement, contrasting it with the more aggressive approach of former President Nixon. The author's acquaintance, a Hollywood dealmaker, is frustrated that Obama did not use the 14th Amendment as leverage against the Republicans, which could have suggested a willingness to take unilateral executive action to uphold the nation's financial obligations. The author reflects on Nixon's ""Madman Theory,"" which was a tactic to make adversaries believe he was capable of extreme actions. The piece then reassesses Nixon's legacy, highlighting his progressive domestic policies that were left-leaning compared to contemporary standards, such as the establishment of various regulatory agencies, affirmative action in federal hiring, and support for social welfare programs. The author suggests that Nixon's aggressive foreign policy stance was a strategic pose, unlike what they perceive as the genuine extremism in the current Republican Party. The author's mother, a lifelong Republican, is cited as someone who would have been shocked by the current state of the party.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action positively, noting it as one of the significant progressive achievements of Nixon's administration. They point out that Nixon ""began affirmative action in federal hiring,"" indicating that the author sees this as a constructive policy move and part of a broader suite of liberal reforms that Nixon surprisingly supported. There is an implicit endorsement of affirmative action as a component of a visionary liberal policy that contributed to social progress. The author's presentation of affirmative action alongside other progressive initiatives suggests they believe it to be a vital and beneficial part of Nixon's legacy."	0.02792	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the provided summary. The text focuses on the Federalist Society and conservative legal circles, mentioning their opposition to affirmative action in a descriptive manner. However, the author does not offer a personal opinion on the matter. The author's own stance on affirmative action is therefore not evident from the summary. The author appears to be more concerned with the broader implications of the Federalist Society's influence on legal policy and judicial appointments than with taking a clear position on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor, was visibly upset at the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala, despite the conservative group's significant influence and celebration of their success in Washington. The Society, which has played a vital role in shaping legal policy and appointing judges, was hosting a series of panels and events attended by members of the Bush cabinet and other influential conservatives. Graglia criticized the administration for not being bold enough in its approach to antitrust laws, suggesting they should be repealed entirely. Other conservatives expressed dissatisfaction with various legal and political matters, including state lawsuits against tobacco companies and efforts to regulate corporations.

Throughout the event, there were expressions of lingering resentment towards liberal ideologies and figures, with some attendees focusing on past grievances rather than current successes. Kenneth Starr, for example, condemned liberals for being result-oriented while seemingly contradicting his own principles of judicial restraint. The author concludes that given the Federalist Society's role in selecting federal judges, there needs to be careful scrutiny of nominees to prevent an extreme conservative shift in the courts. Additionally, there is a call for Democrats and moderate Republicans to defend mainstream legal principles against the current conservative onslaught.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author reflects on their past experience with the Federalist Society during their time on the Harvard Law Review, where members expressed strong opposition to affirmative action. This suggests that the author is familiar with the conservative viewpoint that is critical of affirmative action policies, which are aimed at addressing historical injustices and promoting diversity. The author does not explicitly state their own stance on affirmative action within the provided text, but the mention of it in the context of conservative grumbling suggests the author may view it as a contentious issue among conservative legal circles."	0.030199999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt	3
	None	Michael Teachout's letter focuses on the importance of ideological diversity in President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet and the structure of government rather than directly expressing his views on affirmative action. Although he mentions Colin L. Powell's support for affirmative action as a positive example of diversity, Teachout does not provide his own opinion on the policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor, written by Michael Teachout, responds to an editorial criticizing President-elect George W. Bush for not adding significant ideological diversity to his cabinet. Teachout argues that the editorial board has never demanded ideological diversity from President Clinton's appointments and notes that some of Bush's cabinet picks, like Colin L. Powell and Christie Whitman, do hold different views from the President-elect on issues such as affirmative action and abortion. Teachout emphasizes the importance of the President being able to work with his cabinet and points out that the three branches of government are designed to create a balance of power.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author, Michael Teachout, does not directly state his personal perspective on affirmative action, he does mention General Colin L. Powell's support for it as an example of ideological diversity within Bush's cabinet. This suggests that Teachout believes that having cabinet members with differing views, such as Powell's support for affirmative action, is valuable and contributes to a well-rounded administration. However, since the focus of the letter is on defending Bush's cabinet choices and the structure of government rather than on affirmative action itself, Teachout's own stance on the policy is not explicitly discussed."	0.01633	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action, instead focusing on the integrity of the judicial confirmation process and political maneuvering. The discussion of affirmative action is incidental to the author's primary concern, which is the misrepresentation of Justice Ronnie White's dissent and the Senate's rejection of his judgeship. The author's critique is aimed at the political process and the actions of Senator John Ashcroft, rather than the policy of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the 106th Congress for its perceived failings, highlighting several instances of what the author views as hypocrisy and cynicism. Examples include the appointment of conferees who oppose a patient rights bill, a vote to increase profits for student loan companies, and the attachment of riders to appropriation bills to bypass regular legislative processes and weaken environmental protections. The author is particularly outraged by the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White for a federal judgeship, orchestrated by Senator John Ashcroft, who made false claims about White's record, particularly on the death penalty. The author refutes the accusation of racism against Republicans for rejecting White, instead accusing them of tarnishing the confirmation process and betraying a qualified judge.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express their personal views on affirmative action within the text. However, the author does discuss a related incident involving Judge Earl Blackwell, who opposed affirmative action and made racially charged statements, and Justice Ronnie White, who dissented from a majority opinion that found Blackwell's statements not to compromise his impartiality. The author's focus is on the misrepresentation of White's dissent by Senator Ashcroft, rather than on affirmative action itself. The author seems more concerned with the integrity of the judicial confirmation process and the use of false narratives in political maneuvering than with taking a stand on affirmative action as a policy."	0.024329999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective indicates a nuanced view on affirmative action. While they seem to support the overall goals of affirmative action, they are critical of the specific application in the Piscataway case, calling it 'clumsy.' The acknowledgment of the school board's 'honorable' intentions to maintain diversity suggests a positive view of the underlying principles of affirmative action. However, the author's concern about the potential negative consequences of a Supreme Court ruling on this specific case implies that they may be wary of poorly executed or legally vulnerable affirmative action policies. The author's relief at the case's settlement and their view that the Piscataway case was not the right one for setting a legal precedent on affirmative action further underscores their belief in the importance of affirmative action but also their desire for it to be implemented and defended in a more strategically sound manner.	"Summary:
The Piscataway, New Jersey school board settled a lawsuit with Sharon Taxman, a white teacher who was let go in 1989 to retain a black teacher for diversity reasons. Taxman had won $433,500 in lower court for back pay and legal fees, 70% of which was covered by a coalition of civil rights groups to facilitate the settlement. The Supreme Court was set to hear the case, which many supporters of affirmative action believed could lead to a ruling against race-based employment decisions and potentially threaten affirmative action programs nationwide. The case was seen as a weak basis for such a significant legal discussion due to its unique circumstances: both teachers had the same seniority and similar qualifications, and the decision to retain the black teacher was based on maintaining departmental diversity. The Clinton Administration initially supported the school board's decision but later reversed its stance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the principle of affirmative action but criticizes the specific implementation in the Piscataway case as ""clumsy."" They acknowledge the school board's intention to preserve racial diversity as ""honorable"" but suggest that the case presented a difficult scenario that might not have been the best representation for a broader legal debate on affirmative action. The author seems relieved that the Supreme Court did not rule on this case, as it might have led to a broader prohibition of considering race in employment, which could have negatively impacted voluntary affirmative-action plans. They also indicate that a Supreme Court ruling on the broader issue of racial criteria in employment is inevitable, but the Piscataway case was not the right one for setting such a precedent."	0.023559999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author presents affirmative action as a necessary tool for achieving compelling public goals and criticizes the absolutist, color-blind perspective. They acknowledge the Administration's shift in stance as strategic to protect affirmative action within legal constraints but maintain that affirmative action has valid applications, such as in police recruitment and educational settings. The author's hope that the Supreme Court will recognize the value of affirmative action and the mention of the importance of racial diversity in the judiciary suggest a belief in the benefits of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The Clinton Administration shifted its stance on an affirmative action case before the Supreme Court, involving the Piscataway, N.J., school board, which laid off a white teacher to maintain racial diversity by keeping an equally qualified black teacher. The Administration's new position acknowledges that the school board's action violated the white teacher's civil rights, moving away from its previous support. This change is seen as a strategic attempt to protect affirmative action within the constraints of the Court's recent rulings, which allow racial preferences only to remedy overt discrimination or achieve a ""compelling"" public goal in a ""narrowly tailored"" manner. The Administration argues that there are still valid instances for affirmative action, such as in police recruitment for diversity or in educational settings. However, opponents of affirmative action have gained traction, with some courts ruling against it and states like California banning race-based public hiring practices. The Supreme Court's decision on the Piscataway case could clarify the legitimacy of affirmative action in achieving racial diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author supports affirmative action and believes it is necessary to achieve certain compelling public goals, such as effective policing in diverse communities and fostering racial diversity in educational faculties. They argue that while the Piscataway school board's specific approach was not appropriate, affirmative action should not be completely discarded and still has a place beyond remedying past discrimination. The author criticizes the absolutist, color-blind perspective that rejects any consideration of race in public employment, suggesting that such a stance is incompatible with a commitment to preventing racial discrimination. They point out that recruitment efforts targeting minorities, which are essential to prevent discrimination, would be impossible under a strictly color-blind policy. The author also contends that racial diversity within the Federal judiciary is a compelling interest in its own right, underscoring the importance of nonwhite representation on the bench. Ultimately, the author hopes that the Supreme Court will recognize the value of affirmative action and not adopt an absolutist stance against it."	0.03039	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	Timothy R. Cahn is portrayed as supporting affirmative action policies, but with a rationale that differs from Matsuda and Lawrence. He emphasizes the importance of correcting admissions processes to achieve racial diversity in universities, implying that current systems do not adequately represent society's racial demographics. His argument focuses on the necessity of affirmative action to create university classes that reflect societal diversity, rather than only addressing overt discrimination. Therefore, his stance can be categorized as somewhat in favor, as he supports the policy but suggests a different underlying reason for its necessity.	"Summary:
In a letter to the editor, Timothy R. Cahn responds to an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence about affirmative action. Cahn contends that Matsuda and Lawrence have not presented the strongest argument for maintaining affirmative action policies. He suggests that if racial groups are inherently equal in qualifications, then the underrepresentation of minorities in universities must be due to factors other than merit. Cahn argues that affirmative action is necessary, not primarily to address overt discrimination (as Matsuda and Lawrence suggest), but to correct an admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect the racial diversity of society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Timothy R. Cahn, supports affirmative action but offers a different rationale than the one proposed by Matsuda and Lawrence. He believes that affirmative action is essential for ensuring that university admissions are representative of society's racial demographics. Cahn implies that the current admissions processes are flawed because they lead to disproportionate racial representation. His perspective is that affirmative action should be used as a tool to adjust the admissions process itself, rather than merely as a response to overt discrimination."	0.01593	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, Evan Edwards, is characterized as against affirmative action based on the context provided in the summary. Edwards defends the Republican Party's stance on affirmative action, implying that opposition to these policies is justified and not indicative of gender bias. He suggests that affirmative action is not aligned with the foundational principles of the Republican Party, which, according to him, has historically been inclusive without such policies. The summary does not indicate that Edwards holds an extreme position, but rather that he opposes affirmative action on principle, without providing a vehement or emotionally charged argument against it. Therefore, he is categorized as 'somewhat against' rather than 'strongly against.'	"Summary:
The letter to the editor is a response to Frank Rich's column ""Angry White Woman,"" which discussed Tanya Melich's decision to leave the Republican Party. The author, Evan Edwards, criticizes Melich for her decision, labeling her a ""fink"" and arguing that the Republican Party in Manhattan is actually liberal to ultra-liberal, as opposed to the ultra-right elements she may be referring to, which are more common in the South. Edwards cites the formation of the New York State Conservative Party in the 1960s as a response to liberal Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller, John Lindsay, and Jacob Javits. He also notes that the Republican Party has been inclusive in the past, mentioning the appointment of the first woman to the Supreme Court and the significant roles women played in the Reagan and Bush administrations. Edwards defends the Republican Party's stance on affirmative action and welfare, arguing that opposing these policies does not equate to being anti-women. He concludes by suggesting that Melich's political beliefs align more closely with the Democratic Party, specifically with a New York City Democrat like Ruth Messinger.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Evan Edwards, appears to be against affirmative action. He mentions that being against affirmative action does not make the Republican Party anti-women, implying that he views affirmative action as a policy that could be opposed without harboring any bias against women. Edwards seems to believe that affirmative action is not a core belief of the Republican Party and that the party should not shift away from its foundational principles, which he suggests do not include the support of affirmative action policies."	0.02234	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's text indicates a clear support for measures aimed at addressing historical injustices, such as reparations for slavery. While affirmative action is not directly mentioned, the author's arguments suggest a broader support for policies that aim to correct racial disparities and systemic issues, which affirmative action seeks to address. The author's criticism of those who dismiss the need for such measures, and the call for America to acknowledge and repair the damage caused by slavery, aligns with the principles behind affirmative action. Therefore, the author is likely somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they appear to advocate for policies that would help mitigate racial inequalities, even if affirmative action is not the specific focus of the text.	"Summary:
The text discusses a House Judiciary Committee hearing on H.R. 40, a proposal for a commission to study reparations for slavery in the United States. The hearing coincided with Juneteenth, a significant date commemorating the end of slavery in Texas. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed opposition to reparations, arguing that civil rights legislation and the election of President Barack Obama addressed the issue and that it would be difficult to determine who should be compensated. The author refutes this, highlighting the ongoing effects of historical racism and discrimination, including wage gaps, health care inequities, and environmental issues like the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The author emphasizes the need for America to acknowledge and repair the damage caused by slavery, and calls for a national apology and real change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary measure to address ongoing racial inequalities. They criticize those who believe affirmative action is no longer needed, suggesting that this perspective ignores the persistent disparities and systemic issues faced by the black community. The author's mention of ""the shrugging of shoulders"" of people who dismiss the importance of affirmative action indicates a frustration with the lack of recognition for the continued relevance and necessity of such policies. The author seems to advocate for a proactive approach to correcting historical injustices and achieving equality, which includes support for measures like affirmative action."	0.02699	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author discusses the importance of diversity and historical efforts to promote racial equality and integration, referencing union organizing in postwar Hawaii as a form of 'proto affirmative action.' Although affirmative action is not explicitly addressed, the author's favorable view of deliberate efforts to dismantle racial barriers and create opportunities for all suggests a positive stance towards the concept of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article explores the concept of racial identity and attitudes towards race in Hawaii compared to the mainland United States. Dr. Kristin Pauker, a psychology professor of mixed ancestry, shares her experiences of feeling out of place in a predominantly white institution like Dartmouth College, contrasting it with the more racially mixed and tolerant environment of Hawaii. Her research investigates when children begin to express essentialist views of race, finding that children from mostly white neighborhoods in Boston hold more stereotypical views compared to their counterparts in Hawaii. The author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, also of mixed heritage, delves into the historical context of race relations in Hawaii, the influence of labor union organizing on racial integration, and the potential of Hawaii's racial dynamics as a model for broader societal change. The article suggests that the ""aloha spirit"" and the recognition of ecological limits in Hawaii have fostered a culture of mutual respect and interdependence that could inform a more inclusive and flexible understanding of race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action, he does touch on related themes such as the benefits of diversity and the historical efforts to promote racial equality and integration. The author references the union organizing in postwar Hawaii as a form of ""proto affirmative action"" where leadership positions were intentionally distributed among different ethnic groups to ensure equal representation and foster interracial unity. This historical example illustrates the author's perspective that deliberate efforts to dismantle racial barriers and create opportunities for all can lead to positive changes in race relations. The author seems to support the idea that intentional actions to promote diversity and address racial inequalities can have long-term beneficial effects on society."	0.08526	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, Harry Piotrowski, is highlighted as pointing out an irony in the appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court. Piotrowski's commentary suggests that, although Scalia and Reagan were opponents of affirmative action, Scalia's appointment could be interpreted as a form of affirmative action for Italian Americans. The acknowledgment of this irony does not necessarily indicate Piotrowski's personal stance on affirmative action but rather comments on the perceived inconsistency between Scalia's and Reagan's stated positions and the actions taken. The author's personal view on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the focus is on the irony of the situation rather than on a clear stance for or against affirmative action. Therefore, based on the provided summary, the author's stance on affirmative action is not directly discernible, and we categorize it as neutral.	"Summary:
The text includes letters to the editor concerning the selection of a Supreme Court justice. Robert B. Newlin from Arlington suggests that President Obama should nominate an ""ordinary person"" to the Supreme Court, someone without a political agenda, such as a business executive or educator. Richard L. Sheffield from Columbia criticizes the use of the word ""ordinary"" to describe Americans, suggesting it has negative connotations and implies a kind of noblesse oblige. Harry Piotrowski from Crofton points out the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court, given that Scalia and Reagan were opponents of affirmative action, yet Scalia's appointment could be seen as a form of affirmative action for Italian Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Harry Piotrowski, appears to be critical of affirmative action, particularly in the context of the Supreme Court. He highlights the irony of President Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia, an Italian American, which Piotrowski suggests could be perceived as a form of affirmative action. This is ironic because both Reagan and Scalia were known to oppose affirmative action, viewing it as contrary to a merit-based society. Piotrowski seems to imply that Scalia believed he was appointed solely on merit and deserved his position, despite the emotional commitment and desire for representation that may have influenced Reagan's decision. This suggests that Piotrowski sees a contradiction in Scalia's self-perception and the reality of his appointment, with regards to the principles of affirmative action."	0.02377	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action in the text summary provided. The focus of the article is on the Supreme Court's decision regarding DACA and the Court's interaction with societal expectations. While the author mentions the Court's history with affirmative action, they do not express a personal stance on the matter. Instead, they comment on the Court's pattern of aligning with societal expectations, which includes decisions on affirmative action. The author's perspective on the Court's adaptability to social change does not explicitly convey their own view on the policy of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The article discusses a series of decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court, with a particular focus on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) case. The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled in a 5-4 decision that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate DACA was invalid. The administration's justification for ending DACA was deemed ""arbitrary and capricious"" by Chief Justice Roberts, as it failed to account for the ""reliance interests"" of the Dreamers, their families, employers, and local governments. The decision left open the possibility for the administration to attempt to rescind DACA again, but with a higher bar set due to the outlined reliance interests. The author reflects on other recent decisions by the Court, noting a pattern of the Court aligning with societal expectations and the ongoing dialogue between the Court and society. The author speculates on the Court's future decisions and the conservative legal movement's direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author reflects on the Supreme Court's history with affirmative action, particularly referencing the 2002-2003 term under Chief Justice William Rehnquist. During that term, the Court upheld affirmative action in higher education. The author suggests that the Court's decisions, including those on affirmative action, are not solely legal matters but are also influenced by societal expectations and the justices' engagement with the society they live in. The author indicates a belief that the Court tends to realign itself with what it perceives the public wants or expects. This perspective suggests that the author views the Court's stance on affirmative action as part of its broader tendency to adapt to social change and public opinion."	0.03592	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	Jennifer Lee argues in favor of affirmative action, providing evidence that it does not harm Asian American university admission rates and is necessary to address career mobility and the glass ceiling. She dismisses the idea of racial quotas as unconstitutional and emphasizes the need for affirmative action to combat systemic inequalities. Lee also connects the support for affirmative action to the fight against anti-Asian hate crimes and notes the majority support among Asian Americans for such measures. Her advocacy for the passage of ACA 5 further demonstrates her strong support for affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the opportunity for California voters to repeal Proposition 209 by voting on Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5), which would restore affirmative action in the state. The author, Jennifer Lee, argues against the claim made by some Asian immigrants that affirmative action will impose quotas and harm their children's chances of university admission. She provides evidence that Proposition 209 did not affect Asian American admission rates to the University of California system and that affirmative action is necessary to address blocked career mobility and the glass ceiling faced by Asian Americans in various professional fields. The author also notes the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of recognizing the role of race in these issues. She concludes that the majority of Asian Americans support affirmative action and encourages them to vote for ACA 5.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Jennifer Lee strongly supports affirmative action and views it as a necessary tool to combat historical and systemic inequalities faced by racial, ethnic, and gender minorities. She dismisses the notion that affirmative action would lead to racial quotas, citing that such quotas have been unconstitutional since 1978. Lee emphasizes that affirmative action policies can help Asian Americans break through career ceilings and advance beyond entry-level positions, which is currently not the case despite their high educational achievements. She also highlights the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies in addressing racial discrimination, as evidenced by the recent rise in anti-Asian hate incidents. Lee stresses that affirmative action is about creating equitable opportunities for marginalized groups and correcting the imbalances created by historical discrimination. She is optimistic about the support of affirmative action among Asian Americans, particularly U.S.-born and third-and-higher-generation Asians, and urges them to demonstrate this support by voting in favor of ACA 5."	0.0285	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author criticizes the Department of Justice under the Trump administration for its opposition to affirmative action, suggesting that such opposition is part of a broader reluctance to enforce civil rights. The author's call for the DOJ to be rededicated to its original mission, including the enforcement of civil rights, implies that the author supports affirmative action as a necessary component of civil rights enforcement.	"Summary:
The text commemorates the 150th anniversary of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), which was established after the Civil War to replace private attorneys with full-time professionals and to enforce civil rights for African Americans. The author critiques the DOJ under the Trump administration and Attorney General William P. Barr for presidential interference, favoritism, and a lack of commitment to civil rights, citing examples such as reluctance to investigate police departments and opposition to affirmative action in college admissions. The text suggests that the DOJ has historically faced accusations of undermining the rule of law and proposes reducing the scope of federal criminal law to prevent abuses of power. Despite its flaws, the DOJ is seen as an essential institution that should be rededicated to professionalism, impartiality, and civil rights enforcement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses a critical view of the Trump administration's stance on affirmative action, particularly in college admissions. They highlight the administration's support for lawsuits against affirmative action as indicative of a broader reluctance to maintain an aggressive civil rights posture. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as an important aspect of civil rights enforcement and is opposed to the administration's actions that could undermine such policies. The author believes that the DOJ should be rededicated to its original mission, which includes the protection and enforcement of civil rights, implying support for affirmative action as a component of that mission."	0.02185	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical view of Ronald Reagan's stance on affirmative action, as well as the implication that Reagan's policies were detrimental to civil rights, suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a necessary measure to counteract systemic racism. The author's perspective is presented in opposition to Reagan's approach, which is described as an attempt to abolish affirmative action and frame it as reverse discrimination. This indicates that the author is in favor of affirmative action and views Reagan's opposition to it as harmful.	"Summary:
The text discusses the racial politics of Ronald Reagan and how they relate to the current racial climate in the United States, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Black Americans. The author argues that Donald Trump's racially divisive tactics are not new to the Republican Party, suggesting a historical precedent in the actions and policies of Reagan. The text highlights Reagan's use of racially coded language and his opposition to civil rights advances, including his denouncement of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and his stance on property discrimination. Reagan's presidential terms are characterized as a low point in race relations, with attempts to weaken the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action, as well as contributing to mass incarceration through the ""war on drugs."" The author implies that Reagan's racism, though less overt than Trump's, was equally damaging because it was veiled with a friendly demeanor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author takes a critical view of Ronald Reagan's stance on affirmative action, indicating that Reagan's administration actively sought to abolish it. The author suggests that Reagan framed affirmative action as a form of reverse discrimination against white men, ignoring the systemic inequalities it aimed to address. This perspective is presented as part of a broader critique of Reagan's racial politics and is indicative of the author's view that Reagan's policies were detrimental to civil rights and race relations in the United States. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is a necessary measure to counteract systemic racism, a view that is at odds with Reagan's approach to the policy."	0.03128	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt	3
	None	The author of the text, Melanye Price, does not explicitly discuss her stance on affirmative action as a policy. The focus of the text is on the political achievements and influence of Black women, particularly in relation to Kamala Harris's selection as the vice-presidential candidate. Price emphasizes that Harris's selection is a result of the political work and dedication of Black women, and not merely a consequence of her race and gender. Price's discussion is centered around the political agency and impact of Black women rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, based on the provided text, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined.	"Summary:
The text highlights the significant role Black women have played in shaping the political landscape, particularly within the Democratic Party. It emphasizes that Senator Kamala Harris's selection as the vice-presidential candidate is not merely a product of her race and gender, nor is it an isolated incident. Instead, it is the culmination of the dedicated political labor of Black women, who have consistently shown high voter turnout rates and loyalty to the Democratic Party. Despite receiving little investment from the party, Black women have been instrumental in organizing grassroots efforts to register and motivate voters, resulting in substantial electoral impacts, such as the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017. Furthermore, Black women have founded organizations to support Black female candidates and ensure their voices are heard within the party. The text also acknowledges the historical struggles of Black women in the fight for voting rights and their ongoing commitment to universal rights for all groups. Kamala Harris's selection is seen as a collective victory for Black women in politics, building on the legacy of earlier pioneers and representing a significant step forward in their political journey.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melanye Price, does not directly discuss affirmative action as a policy in the provided text. Instead, she addresses the potential mischaracterization of Kamala Harris's selection as a result of affirmative action, which she argues would be a mistake. Price's perspective suggests that Harris's selection is not merely about fulfilling diversity quotas or being a token representation of race and gender. Rather, it is a recognition of the substantial and strategic political work done by Black women within the Democratic Party. Price views Harris's selection as a testament to the growing political power and influence of Black women, who have been organizing, voting, and advocating for their interests and the interests of their communities. The author's focus is on the legitimacy of Harris's position due to the collective efforts and political sophistication of Black women, rather than on affirmative action as a policy."	0.0311	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text expresses admiration for Ruth Bader Ginsburg's work on gender and racial equality, specifically noting Ginsburg's use of historical context and data to support affirmative action programs. The author highlights Ginsburg's recognition of 'centuries of law-sanctioned inequality' and her efforts to address systemic discrimination through the legal system. This indicates that the author views affirmative action as a necessary tool to promote equality and counteract the enduring effects of past injustices, aligning with Ginsburg's perspective. The author's recounting of Ginsburg's approach and the positive tone when discussing her advocacy suggest that the author is in favor of affirmative action, likely aligning with Ginsburg's own stance.	"Summary:
The text is a personal reflection on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's influence on the author, who was inspired by Ginsburg as a young woman lawyer in the 1970s. Ginsburg, as a pioneer for gender equality, advocated for both men and women to be free from gender-based stereotypes and to assume any societal role. She had a successful record as an advocate before the Supreme Court and was known for her incremental approach to legal change and her respect for judicial precedent. Ginsburg's decisions often included historical context and data to support her views on gender and racial equality. She was critical of systemic discrimination and brought her own experiences into her legal reasoning, as seen in her dissent in Lilly Ledbetter's pay discrimination case. Ginsburg's influence extends beyond her own decisions to those of her colleagues and lower-court judges. In her later years, Ginsburg became a more frequent dissenter on the increasingly conservative Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a proponent of affirmative action, highlighting Ginsburg's approach to cases involving affirmative action programs. Ginsburg would meticulously recount data demonstrating the persistence of racial inequity in various societal sectors, acknowledging the historical context of ""centuries of law-sanctioned inequality."" This suggests that the author appreciates Ginsburg's acknowledgment of systemic discrimination and her efforts to address it through the legal system. Ginsburg's perspective, as interpreted by the author, is that affirmative action is a necessary response to the enduring effects of past injustices, and it serves as a tool to promote equality and counteract systemic discrimination. The author's recounting of Ginsburg's approach to these cases indicates approval and a shared understanding of the importance of affirmative action in achieving a more equitable society."	0.03117	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is embedded within a larger narrative about racial injustice and the quest for constitutional justice, rather than mob justice. While the author does not explicitly advocate for or against affirmative action, they do highlight the policy's relevance in addressing systemic barriers faced by African-Americans. The mention of a teacher's comment misrepresenting affirmative action suggests the author's awareness of the misconceptions around the policy and hints at a defense of its intention to combat inequality. However, without a clear and focused argument on affirmative action itself, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance as either for or against it based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the aftermath of the decision not to charge any police officers directly with the death of Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman shot by police in her home. Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, faced criticism for charging only one officer, and not for Taylor's death but for endangering her neighbors. The author reflects on the history of racial injustice, particularly in the Southern states, and how the term ""mob justice"" used by Cameron is historically loaded and offensive. The author argues that the protests are not seeking mob justice but constitutional justice, and that the lack of accountability for police officers who kill citizens contributes to a lack of trust in the government by African-Americans. The piece also touches on the broader experience of racism and how it shapes the lives of Black individuals, including the author's personal experiences.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action in the context of racial prejudice and the experiences that lead African-Americans to realize their racial identity. The author suggests that affirmative action is often misunderstood or misrepresented, as indicated by a teacher's comment that it would be the reason for a Black student's admission to a great college, rather than acknowledging the student's own merits or the systemic barriers they face. This reflects a perspective that affirmative action is a necessary but often contested policy, aimed at addressing historical and ongoing racial inequalities in education and other opportunities. The author's inclusion of this detail suggests a recognition of the complexities and controversies surrounding affirmative action, as well as its role in the broader conversation about race and justice in America."	0.03052	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's argument is centered around the defense of affirmative action policies at Yale University, emphasizing the importance of diversity and the slow progress that has been made in achieving it. The author cites specific examples of the university's efforts to increase representation of underrepresented groups and criticizes the Trump administration's lawsuit as a threat to these efforts. The author's commitment to fighting against efforts that undermine affirmative action and the call for continued progress towards equity in higher education indicate a strong support for these policies.	"Summary:
The author, a Yale undergraduate and former student-body president, argues that Yale University is being unfairly criticized for its affirmative action policies. Despite accusations that Yale does too much for underrepresented students, the author believes that progress has been slow and insufficient. He cites historical examples of slow progress, such as the renaming of a building named after a slavery advocate and the delayed empowerment of the ethnic studies department. The author highlights the low percentage of faculty from underrepresented backgrounds and stresses the need for more diversity on campus.

The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Yale, accusing it of discriminating against Asian American and White applicants by considering race in admissions. The author argues that removing race from admissions considerations would significantly decrease the representation of African American and Hispanic students, as seen in a similar case against Harvard. He also references disparities in the quality of education in high-poverty versus low-poverty schools, which predominantly affect students of color.

The author asserts that Yale's president is committed to maintaining a diverse student body and that students support the administration's defense of its admissions policies. The author fears that the lawsuit is part of a broader campaign against affirmative action and could lead to the Supreme Court potentially ending race-conscious admissions. He concludes by expressing his desire for continued progress towards equity in higher education and vows to fight against efforts to undermine these efforts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is a strong proponent of affirmative action. He views it as a necessary tool to promote diversity and equity in higher education, especially given the historical and ongoing challenges faced by students from underrepresented backgrounds. He sees the Trump administration's lawsuit as a threat to the progress made in diversifying college campuses and believes that affirmative action policies are essential for creating opportunities for all students, regardless of their race or ethnicity. The author is committed to defending Yale's admissions processes and the broader principle of race-conscious admissions as a means to address systemic inequalities and foster inclusive educational environments."	0.030419999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Dahleen Glanton, appears to view affirmative action as a necessary tool for advancing economic equality for African Americans, who have historically faced systemic barriers. While the summary does not explicitly mention affirmative action, it can be inferred from the author's discussion of economic parity, systemic support, and the opposition to measures that correct racial imbalances that Glanton would be supportive of affirmative action. The author's outrage at the suggestion that Black people should be grateful for improvements which they have achieved through their own efforts also suggests a belief in the need for systemic measures like affirmative action to ensure fair opportunities.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of Donald Trump's claims that he has done more for the Black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. The author, Dahleen Glanton, expresses outrage at Trump's suggestion that Black people should be grateful to him and compares his rhetoric to that of a slave master claiming to be benevolent. Glanton highlights the racist undertones in Trump's statements and points out the hypocrisy of both Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who have both inherited wealth and yet criticize African Americans for not being successful. The author also refutes the claim that Trump has been a savior for Black people by presenting data that shows African Americans have been improving economically over the years, independent of Trump's presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is an important equalizer that has sought to provide a bridge to economic parity for African Americans. Glanton suggests that the system in America has historically offered little or no assistance to Black people and has actively fought against measures like affirmative action that aim to correct racial imbalances. The author implies that despite the lack of systemic support and the challenges posed by such opposition, African Americans have still managed to achieve impressive economic gains. This underscores the author's view that affirmative action and similar policies are critical in advancing economic equality and countering the systemic barriers faced by the Black community."	0.02672	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author of the text, Phillip Lopate, provides an overview of Richard Rodriguez's views on affirmative action from his book 'Hunger of Memory.' Rodriguez is portrayed as being against affirmative action, using his personal experiences to argue his stance. He reflects on the impact of his education on his personal life and believes in the necessity of personal achievement and integration, even at the cost of distancing himself from his family and cultural background. The summary does not explicitly state Lopate's own stance on affirmative action, but rather describes Rodriguez's position. Therefore, the stance attributed here is Rodriguez's, not Lopate's.	"Summary:
This text presents a review of several essay collections by different authors, highlighting the unique qualities and themes of each work. Mary McCarthy's ""On the Contrary"" is noted for its contrarian intelligence and critique of both political extremes, as well as self-reflection on her liberal anticommunist stance. Leonard Michaels' essays, in ""The Essays of Leonard Michaels,"" are praised for their personal touch and storytelling, with a particular focus on his Jewish and Yiddish influences. Vladimir Nabokov's ""Speak, Memory"" is admired for its enchanting portrayal of his aristocratic childhood and subsequent years of exile. Richard Rodriguez's ""Hunger of Memory"" is recognized for its controversial stand against bilingual education and affirmative action, using personal experiences to make his political arguments. Lastly, Susan Sontag's ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" is appreciated for its cultural criticism and warm tributes to various intellectuals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Phillip Lopate, reviews Richard Rodriguez's perspective on affirmative action as presented in ""Hunger of Memory."" Rodriguez, who is against affirmative action, uses his personal narrative to explain his views. He reflects on his own educational journey as a ""scholarship boy"" from a working-class background and how his academic success distanced him from his family. Rodriguez believes that while there were significant losses in his personal life due to his educational pursuits, these were necessary sacrifices for what he gained. His opposition to affirmative action is based on his belief that his personal achievements and integration into a more cultivated world were crucial, even if they led to a separation from his familial and cultural roots. The text suggests that Rodriguez's position on affirmative action is deeply intertwined with his personal experiences and the tension between his private and public identities."	0.03326	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author, Devon Westhill, expresses criticism of the Marin County UBI program's race- and sex-based eligibility criteria, which he believes is unjust and legally questionable. Westhill's argument against the exclusion of certain groups based on race and sex indicates a perspective that is against affirmative action policies that create such exclusions. He is concerned with the potential for these policies to deepen racial divisions and to be seen as discriminatory. His use of a personal anecdote to illustrate the similarities in experiences of poverty across races further underscores his stance against race-based selection criteria.	"Summary:
Marin County in California is set to launch an experiment providing a ""universal basic income"" (UBI) of $1,000 a month to 125 low-income residents starting in May. This initiative, funded by both the Marin Community Foundation and public funds, is designed to assist low-income individuals. However, unlike a similar experiment in Stockton, California, the Marin program specifically targets ""mothers of color,"" excluding white mothers and fathers from eligibility. This race- and sex-based selection criteria for receiving public assistance raise legal concerns under the California Constitution's equal-protection clause, which mandates strict scrutiny for racial and sex classifications.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Devon Westhill, is critical of the Marin County UBI program's focus on ""mothers of color"" as it excludes other demographics, such as white mothers and fathers, who may be equally in need. Westhill argues that this approach constitutes racial injustice and is legally dubious, potentially violating equal protection principles enshrined in the California Constitution and the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He shares a personal anecdote about his white mother raising three black children in poverty, suggesting that her experiences were similar to those of black mothers and that excluding someone based on skin color is unjust. Westhill warns that while UBI might have good intentions, implementing it with a race-based focus could deepen racial divisions and taint it with accusations of racism. He implies that affirmative action, when based on race or sex, can be counterproductive and divisive, especially when it leads to the exclusion of certain groups from public assistance programs."	0.02467	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion suggests a nuanced view of affirmative action. They acknowledge systemic inequities and the need for policies that address these disparities, but they are critical of the way affirmative action is implemented in elite universities, which can benefit the already privileged. The author's emphasis on broad policies aimed at reducing class gaps indicates a preference for more inclusive and systemic approaches to address inequality rather than narrow affirmative action policies that may not reach the most disadvantaged. Thus, the author is not entirely against affirmative action but seems to advocate for a reformed and more effective version of it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the disparities in the United States that affect the Black community, extending beyond police violence to systemic inequities, particularly in education. The author points out that while the murder of George Floyd brought attention to racial inequities in the criminal justice system, other systemic issues have not received as much focus. The text highlights the fact that Black men live, on average, five years less than white men, and a Black newborn in Washington, D.C., has a lower life expectancy than one in India.

The author criticizes the public education system, which is funded locally, leading to a disparity where poor children attend underfunded schools and wealthy children attend well-funded ones. This has resulted in increased racial segregation in schools since 1988. The author also mentions the Supreme Court case Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District, which upheld unequal school funding.

The text further discusses how affluent white Americans benefit from legacy admissions in elite universities, exclusionary zoning laws, and a tax system that disproportionately audits the poor. The author suggests that early childhood programs, baby bonds, child tax credits, job training, and a higher minimum wage could address these inequities and are part of President Biden's proposals.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author appears critical of the current form of affirmative action in elite universities, which gives legacy preferences and additional consideration to children of big donors, often benefiting the highly privileged. This system is contrasted with the broader need for policies that promote equality and opportunity for underprivileged groups. The author implies that affirmative action, as it is practiced in these contexts, perpetuates class and racial disparities rather than mitigating them. The author suggests that framing progressive policies as reducing class gaps rather than race gaps might be more effective in garnering public support, hinting at a complex view of how affirmative action and similar policies should be approached to address systemic inequality."	0.042050000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as somewhat in favor, as the text associates affirmative action with California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality. While the text does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action, it suggests that the author views affirmative action-like policies as positive steps towards reversing discriminatory practices and ensuring equal access. Moreover, the author expresses concern over the potential rollback of such policies if the current leadership is replaced, indicating a belief in the importance of these policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential consequences of Governor Gavin Newsom's recall for California's values and policies. It highlights that the leading Republican recall candidates, particularly Larry Elder, do not align with the values that most Californians cherish. These values include the protection of natural resources, diversity, tolerance, equality, embracing democracy, and support for marginalized communities. The text argues that California has evolved into a beacon of tolerance and equality, with policies under Newsom's leadership aiming to reverse discriminatory practices and ensure equal access. The state's expansive approach to voting rights is contrasted with Republican efforts in other states to suppress voting. The text warns that the gains made in criminal justice reform and support for the needy are at risk if Newsom is recalled, as most Republican candidates oppose these reforms. The author believes these values are shared by Californians because they have been enacted by officials elected by the majority, and the recall election itself is seen as a test of democracy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive, viewing it as part of California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality. The author notes that California has a history of discrimination, referencing the repeal of affirmative action in 1996 as one of the ""ballot-box assaults"" on inclusivity. However, the text suggests that the state has made progress in recent years under Newsom's leadership, with efforts to reverse discriminatory policies and ensure equal access. The author expresses concern that the progress made, including the support for affirmative action-like policies, could be undone if Newsom is recalled and replaced by a Republican candidate who denies the existence of racial discrimination and inequality."	0.029539999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but the text discusses the issue within the context of electoral strategy and public opinion. The author relays David Shor's view that affirmative action is 'surprisingly unpopular' with voters of color and implies that the Democratic Party's focus on such issues might not align with the preferences of the general electorate. This suggests a critical view of affirmative action's political viability rather than its moral or ethical dimensions. However, because the author's personal stance on affirmative action is not explicitly given, and the discussion is framed around political strategy rather than personal belief, it is most appropriate to categorize the author as 'neutral' regarding their stance on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived liberal bias in the media and its potential impact on the Democratic Party's electoral success. The author reflects on a column by Ezra Klein regarding progressive election analyst David Shor's concerns about the Democratic Party's activist base, which is predominantly young, educated, and leans left. Shor believes that the issues that excite this base, such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action, are not as popular with the general electorate, including voters of color. Progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio and law professor Ian Haney Lopez offer alternative views on messaging, emphasizing the need to make important issues popular rather than simply focusing on what is already popular. The author suggests that while Shor's strategy of prioritizing popular ideas may be more effective for gaining power, it might be challenging to sell to idealistic campaign staff and newsrooms. The media's leftward shift is seen as creating an echo chamber that reinforces divisive identity politics and could hinder Democrats from appealing to a broader electorate. The text warns that the media's alignment with the left could lead to an electoral disaster for Democrats if they do not address the disconnect between their activist base and the wider voting public.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents David Shor's perspective that affirmative action, along with other progressive issues, is surprisingly unpopular with the voters of color it is intended to attract. This implies that the author recognizes a disconnect between the policy's intentions and its reception among its target demographic, suggesting that the policy may not be as universally supported by minority groups as some may assume. The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, but they do highlight the potential electoral risks for Democrats if they continue to prioritize issues that do not resonate with the broader electorate."	0.03072	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They support a traditional form of affirmative action aimed at addressing past discrimination, which suggests some level of favorability towards the policy. However, they are critical of more radical interpretations that advocate for present and future discrimination as remedies. This criticism indicates a concern for the potential excesses or misapplications of affirmative action rather than the concept itself. The author's support for true equality without reducing individuals to demographic categories suggests a preference for a merit-based system that still acknowledges historical injustices. Therefore, the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, provided it aligns with their view of promoting equality without compromising individual merit.	"Summary:
The author expresses a deep sense of alienation from both major political parties in the United States. Having started as a registered Democrat and later becoming an independent, the author finds the current political climate characterized by extreme interpretations of American identity troubling. The Republican Party is criticized for its Trumpist elements, which are seen as threatening the foundations of the republic through undermining election integrity, condoning insurrection, and promoting an exclusionary view of citizenship. On the other hand, the Democratic Party is no longer seen as a comfortable home for traditional liberals like the author, as it has been overtaken by a radical movement that prioritizes identity over common values and seeks a form of retributive justice rather than equality. The author laments the loss of a political space for the broad center of the American electorate and speculates about the potential rise of an independent presidential candidate or a reformist within the Democratic Party to fill the current political void.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author supports the concept of Lyndon B. Johnson-style affirmative action, which is seen as a sensible approach to addressing past discrimination. However, they are critical of Ibram X. Kendi's interpretation of affirmative action, as presented in ""How to Be an Antiracist,"" which calls for present and future discrimination as remedies. The author views this as a dangerous and radical shift away from the principles of true equality and the pursuit of a shared national identity based on laws and values, rather than race or origin. The author believes in a commitment to the ideal of true equality, which does not reduce individuals to demographic categories."	0.03732	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt	3
	None	The provided summary does not directly discuss affirmative action; instead, it critiques hate crime legislation and its implications for free speech and thought policing. The author's perspective on affirmative action can only be inferred indirectly through their concerns about labeling opposition to certain policies as 'hate speech.' As the summary does not provide explicit evidence of the author's stance on affirmative action, we cannot accurately categorize their position. Therefore, based on the information given, the author's stance on affirmative action is not addressed in the summary.	"Summary:
This text critiques the use of hate crime legislation in the United States, particularly in the case of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers, who were convicted of hate crimes after already being sentenced for murder. The author argues that punishing individuals for their thoughts or beliefs, even when abhorrent, is a step towards totalitarianism. The text references Jacob Sullum's opinion on the matter, pointing out the issues with double jeopardy and First Amendment rights. It also discusses the potential for government overreach in policing thought and speech, drawing comparisons with Europe's approach to regulating hate speech. The author is concerned about the expansion of what constitutes ""hate speech"" and the implications for free speech. Finally, the text suggests that the government should focus on its fundamental duties rather than conducting trials that serve as moral statements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and implies that it is a form of thought policing. The text suggests that opposition to race-based affirmative action could be considered ""hate speech"" under the broad and elastic definitions being used by some institutions. This indicates that the author may view affirmative action as a contentious issue that is being protected from legitimate debate by labeling dissent as hate speech. The author is concerned that this approach stifles free speech and debate on important public policy issues."	0.02553	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be positive based on their appreciation for Justice O'Connor's shift towards supporting affirmative action and their optimistic view of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's potential influence on the Supreme Court. The author criticizes those who reduce a person's qualifications to race alone and seems to value the broader impact of diversity that affirmative action policies promote. The author's stance is not explicitly stated, but their positive discussion of affirmative action and diversity suggests a favorable view.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the evolution of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's perspective, particularly regarding affirmative action, influenced by her interactions with Justice Thurgood Marshall. Initially, O'Connor was known for opposing affirmative action and favoring states' rights, but by the end of her tenure on the Supreme Court, she had authored a majority opinion preserving affirmative action in university admissions. The author suggests that while it's not solely due to Marshall's influence, it cannot be entirely discounted either. The text then transitions to discussing President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who, if confirmed, would bring a diverse background to the court, not just in terms of race but also her experience as a public defender and public school graduate. The author argues that focusing solely on race diminishes the full appreciation of what a person offers and criticizes the expectation that minority nominees should express their views on race-related cases. The text concludes by suggesting that Jackson's own success story and shared experiences with other justices might prompt them to reconsider their views, potentially changing the conversation on the court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, evidenced by their appreciation of Justice O'Connor's eventual support for it and their criticism of those who oppose or question the policy. The author seems to believe in the power of diverse experiences, including those shaped by race, to inform and possibly influence judicial perspectives and decisions. The text implies that affirmative action is a necessary and beneficial policy that contributes to diversity and equity, and the author seems hopeful that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's presence on the Supreme Court might inspire her colleagues to think differently about such issues."	0.049740000000000006	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, David Bernstein, appears to be critical of a one-sided approach to teaching race and affirmative action in schools, emphasizing the need for a balanced and open discussion that includes multiple perspectives. While he does not explicitly state his personal stance on affirmative action, his advocacy for a comprehensive and nuanced educational approach, including both arguments for and against affirmative action, suggests that he values critical thinking and debate over the topic. His concern about policies that may limit discussions on affirmative action also indicates that he believes such discussions are an important part of education. However, without a clear indication of his personal position on the policy of affirmative action itself, it is most appropriate to categorize his stance as neutral, as he focuses on the educational approach rather than the policy.	"Summary:
David Bernstein, the author of the article, discusses the polarized perspectives on teaching race and racism in American schools. He criticizes the highly prescriptive, ideological approach to teaching these subjects, as seen in an ""Antiracist Audit"" from Montgomery County Public Schools, which he feels lacks openness to alternative viewpoints and debate. Bernstein shares his son's experience, where discussions on race in school leave no room for individual thoughts or dissenting opinions. He also expresses concern over the Virginia governor's executive order to ban ""divisive concepts,"" which could limit discussions on affirmative action and other important issues. Bernstein advocates for a balanced education that includes multiple perspectives on American history, including both ""1619"" and ""1776"" narratives, and exposure to a range of scholarly opinions on systemic racism and other contributing factors to racial disparities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bernstein appears to be critical of the way affirmative action is currently being taught in schools, suggesting that it is presented from a singular perspective without room for debate or the consideration of alternative viewpoints. He believes that students should be taught about various sides of the affirmative action debate and about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences as part of a comprehensive social studies curriculum. Bernstein's concern is that certain policies, like the Virginia governor's executive order, could discourage or even prohibit discussions on affirmative action in schools, which he sees as detrimental to a well-rounded education. He advocates for teaching students about the complexities of issues like affirmative action, including the arguments for and against it, to encourage open inquiry and critical thinking."	0.03248	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. However, the concern expressed by the individuals in the text about the potential rollback of civil rights, including the mention of Title IX and the historical context of the Civil War and Brown v. Board of Education, suggests a fear that affirmative action could also be at risk. This implies that the authors may view affirmative action as an important civil right that should be protected. Their perspective seems to lean towards a cautious or concerned view of the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action, but without a clear, explicit statement, it is difficult to categorize their stance definitively.	"Summary:
The texts provided are a series of opinions from different individuals reacting to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had previously guaranteed federal protection for abortion rights. Linda Linton expresses concern about the future of the United States, fearing a shift towards becoming a Christian nation and the potential loss of rights for various groups, including the impact on affirmative action. Michael D. Abell sees the decision as a victory for states' rights, reminiscent of the Southern states' stance during the Civil War, and fears a rollback of civil rights to a pre-Brown v. Board of Education era. George Miller warns that Title IX, which protects against gender discrimination in education, could be at risk due to the logic used in the Roe v. Wade decision. Julie Thostenson takes a different stance, emphasizing personal responsibility and body autonomy in the context of pregnancy and childbirth.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the author's direct perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, there is a clear concern about the potential impact of the Supreme Court's decision on a range of civil rights issues, which could include affirmative action. The overturning of Roe v. Wade is seen as a possible precedent for challenging other rights and protections that have been established more recently, such as those provided by Title IX. The authors fear that the rationale used to overturn Roe v. Wade could be applied to dismantle other rights, including those that support affirmative action policies. They view the decision as a step backward for civil rights and express anxiety about the future of equal rights in the United States."	0.026660000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, Renu Mukherjee, appears to criticize the current implementation of affirmative action and advocates for race-neutral alternatives. Her use of personal experience to highlight unrecognized forms of diversity suggests that she believes affirmative action is not the most effective way to achieve diversity in higher education. Her stance indicates a preference for a different approach that does not rely on race as the primary factor in admissions, which suggests she is somewhat against or strongly against the current practice of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court is set to hear challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill. Despite affirmative action being banned in nine states and a lack of unanimous public support, the debate continues. Justin Driver suggests a middle path to transition to race-neutral admissions, referencing Justice O'Connor's opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger which anticipated the end of racial preferences in 25 years. Linda Greenhouse reflects on how the meaning of Brown v. Board of Education is still contested. Renu Mukherjee argues against affirmative action, advocating for race-neutral alternatives and sharing her personal experience of unrecognized diversity. These essays provide insight into the future of higher education and the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Renu Mukherjee, has a critical view of affirmative action. She believes that affirmative action has not effectively advanced diversity on campuses and argues for the efficacy of race-neutral alternatives. Mukherjee uses her own experience as an example of diversity that is not acknowledged by race-conscious admissions programs, indicating her belief that affirmative action policies may overlook various forms of diversity that do not align with racial categorizations. Her perspective suggests that she supports a more multifaceted approach to diversity that moves beyond race as the primary factor in college admissions."	0.02749	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the text are critical of the Supreme Court's conservative majority, which they imply may reverse affirmative action in school admissions. They reference the historical context of affirmative action as a remedy for segregation in schools, suggesting that the current court's anticipated move away from affirmative action is a departure from the judiciary's role in advancing civil rights. The authors advocate for affirmative action as a means to uphold civil rights and ensure equal educational opportunities, indicating a stance that is supportive of affirmative action measures.	"Summary:
The article critiques Chief Justice John Roberts's 2022 year-end report on the federal judiciary for its omissions. Roberts begins by referencing the desegregation of schools and threats against judges, praising new legislation protecting judges' personal information. However, he avoids discussing recent controversies involving the Supreme Court, such as the lack of an effective recusal system for justices, the leak of the draft decision on abortion rights, and insufficient financial disclosures. The report also fails to address the decline in the use of federal courts, with a reduction in appellate filings and trial-level civil cases, despite not accounting for a large number of consolidated cases regarding faulty military earplugs. The authors suggest that the Supreme Court's conservative majority and its interpretations of the Federal Arbitration Act have discouraged civil rights lawyers and limited access to the courts for many potential litigants. They call for Congress to reinvigorate federal rights and end the control of defendants over court access, as exemplified by a recent amendment allowing victims of sexual assault and harassment to sue in court rather than being forced into arbitration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express concern about the Supreme Court's potential reversal of affirmative action in school admissions, highlighting that it was a remedy spawned by the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which originally aimed to desegregate schools and was supported by the Supreme Court in 1954. They imply that the current Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, is not interested in continuing the tradition of protecting civil rights through measures like affirmative action. The perspective presented is that the court's anticipated move away from affirmative action represents a departure from its historical role in advancing civil rights and making the judiciary accessible to all. The authors seem to advocate for affirmative action as a necessary tool for upholding civil rights and ensuring equal opportunities in education."	0.032909999999999995	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author, William McGurn, appears to be critical of affirmative action policies as they are implemented in the context of Fairfax County's public education system. His use of phrases such as 'war on achievement' and his portrayal of the changes in racial composition at TJ as a reduction in Asian-American enrollment suggest that he views these policies as having negative consequences, particularly for high-achieving Asian-American students. He also seems to believe that the policies are not just about preventing discrimination but have evolved into an agenda that seeks equal outcomes at the expense of individual merit and achievement. Therefore, McGurn's perspective can be categorized as being 'strongly against' affirmative action in the context he discusses.	"Summary:
William McGurn discusses the controversy surrounding the failure of several high schools in Northern Virginia to notify students of their National Merit recognitions. The issue began when Asra Nomani revealed that her son and other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ) were not informed of their awards. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation, which then expanded to include more schools as similar issues were uncovered. TJ had previously changed its admissions policy to increase African-American and Hispanic representation, reducing the number of Asian-American students, which a federal judge noted in 2022. The article suggests that the failure to notify students of their National Merit status may be part of a broader ""equity agenda"" that seeks equal outcomes and de-emphasizes individual achievement, disproportionately affecting Asian-American students.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William McGurn, appears to be critical of affirmative action policies, particularly as implemented in the context of Fairfax County's public education system. He describes affirmative action as having evolved from a ""benevolent effort to prevent discrimination"" into a ""war on achievement."" McGurn points to the significant changes in the racial composition of the incoming class at TJ following the removal of a merit-based entrance exam, suggesting that the policy was successful in its goal to reduce Asian-American enrollment in favor of other minorities. He also implies that the ""equity warriors"" resent Asian-American achievement because it contradicts the narrative of systemic racism and minority failure in America. McGurn's perspective suggests a belief that affirmative action and equity agendas can lead to discrimination against high-achieving groups, in this case, Asian-Americans, and can undermine merit-based recognition and individual accomplishments."	0.03038	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	Vivek Ramaswamy's perspective on affirmative action is clearly outlined in the summary. He plans to eliminate affirmative action, rescind Executive Order 11246, and prosecute illegal race-based preferences. His advocacy for a merit-based approach and the intention to remove affirmative action indicates that he is strongly against it. He believes that affirmative action undermines merit and creates division, and his policy proposals are aimed at dismantling affirmative action in various sectors.	"Summary:
Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old political outsider and co-founder of Strive Asset Management, announces his candidacy for President of the United States. He criticizes the current state of America, which he sees as suffering from a national identity crisis and a decline in faith, patriotism, and hard work. Ramaswamy describes contemporary movements such as climatism, Covidism, and gender ideology as secular religions that fail to provide a meaningful sense of American identity. He argues that the Republican Party should offer an inspiring national identity that counters the ""woke"" agenda and proposes a cultural movement to create a new American Dream focused on the pursuit of excellence.

Ramaswamy advocates for a merit-based approach to various aspects of American life, including immigration, economic success, governance, and the marketplace of ideas. He proposes securing the border, ending lottery-based immigration, and favoring meritocratic admission. He also aims to eliminate affirmative action, rescind Executive Order 11246, prosecute illegal race-based preferences, and reform civil service. Ramaswamy calls for transparency from technology companies regarding censorship and wants to protect political expression as a civil right. He highlights the need to confront China's rise and suggests economic independence, energy leadership, and holding China accountable for its actions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Vivek Ramaswamy is strongly opposed to affirmative action. He views it as a system that disfavors qualified applicants based on race, particularly white and Asian-American individuals, and believes it creates resentment and condescension towards black and Hispanic hires. Ramaswamy argues that affirmative action undermines the principle of merit and intends to eliminate it across the American economy if elected president. He plans to rescind Executive Order 11246, which mandates race-based hiring preferences for federal contractors, and direct the Justice Department to prosecute what he considers illegal race-based preferences. His stance is that merit should be the sole determinant of success in America."	0.03233	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's text does not directly state a personal stance on affirmative action but rather criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court's handling of affirmative action cases as part of a critique of the Court's perceived partisan decisions. The author's focus is on the Court's process, suggesting that decisions are being made based on political ideology rather than legal principles, and implies that the Court is undermining democratic principles by negating self-government and abandoning judicial standards. Although the author's perspective on the Court's treatment of affirmative action is negative, the text does not provide a clear and explicit personal endorsement or rejection of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of the current U.S. Supreme Court, which the author believes has overstepped its boundaries and has become a partisan entity rather than an impartial judicial body. The author argues that the Court has been making decisions based on political ideology rather than legal principles, pointing to recent rulings on issues such as women's health, affirmative action, student debt forgiveness, and LGBTQ+ discrimination. The author criticizes the Court for abandoning judicial standards, including the principle of stare decisis, and for creating standing in cases where it should not exist. The text suggests that the Court's actions are undermining democracy and self-government, with justices appearing as partisan figures rather than impartial arbiters. The author calls for reforms such as term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion, and ethics reform to restore the Court's legitimacy and ensure that democracy survives.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decisions on affirmative action as part of a broader pattern of the Court imposing a right-wing agenda. The author suggests that the Court's handling of the affirmative action case is indicative of its disregard for legal doctrine and consistent rules of construction. By casting aside stare decisis without proper justification, the author believes the Court is muscling its way to desired outcomes that align with conservative political aims, rather than engaging in authentic judicial review. The text implies that the author sees the Court's actions on affirmative action as an illegitimate subversion of democratic principles and a negation of self-government, rather than a fair interpretation of the law."	0.03275	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern over the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action, suggesting that it could lead to decreased college enrollments among students of color and a less diverse academic environment. They also reference Suzanne Szostak's disagreement with the decision, wishing it was as emotionless and data-driven as an AI chatbot, which implies that the author believes the decision may not have considered the full human and societal implications. The author's focus on the potential negative consequences of ending affirmative action indicates a stance that is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author discusses the impact of AI, particularly AI like ChatGPT, on the job market and higher education in light of the Supreme Court's decision to end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions. With AI taking over many desk jobs, the author questions the value of a traditional four-year college education. They suggest that young people might be better off learning skills for physically demanding jobs, which AI cannot perform. The author also reflects on the irony of technology possibly making us more human by pushing us towards healthier, outdoor work. They highlight the emotional and stylistic limitations of AI in creative fields like writing, noting that while some businesses have shifted to AI for cost savings, others have returned to human writers for quality. The author is skeptical about the Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action, suggesting that its end may further decrease college enrollments, particularly among young men and students of color, potentially leaving academia and certain fields dominated by AI.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as an important policy for ensuring diversity and opportunity in higher education. They express concern about the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action, implying that it might have been premature and could have negative consequences for students of color and academia as a whole. The author suggests that without affirmative action, college enrollments may decline further, especially among Black and Brown students, leading to a less diverse academic environment. They also allude to the opinion of Suzanne Szostak, who seemingly disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision, wishing it was as emotionless and data-driven as an AI chatbot. This reflects the author's concern that the ruling may not fully grasp the human and societal implications of ending affirmative action."	0.031139999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided summary. The summary focuses on the Supreme Court's ruling in the 303 Creative v. Elenis case, which deals with the refusal of service to same-sex couples based on religious beliefs. Although the case is related to discrimination and minority rights, it does not directly address affirmative action policies or the author's stance on them. As such, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given text.	"Summary:
The provided text is a collection of opinions from different individuals responding to the Supreme Court's ruling in the 303 Creative v. Elenis case, where the court sided with a web designer who refused to provide services to same-sex couples. Michael D. Schattman humorously suggests that the Supreme Court has been pranked by the case's absurdity. Kathy Viney criticizes the use of religious freedom to justify discrimination. Ravin Bhatia expresses fear for the LGBTQ+ community's rights and sees the ruling as a major setback. Aimée La Fountain is astonished by the case's progression to the Supreme Court despite its speculative nature and hopes for legal repercussions against the web designer's tactics. David Dorsen points out the complexity of the ruling and the potential implications for different scenarios involving discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, is critical and concerned. The mention of the Supreme Court's ""gutting of affirmative action"" suggests that the author views the court's actions as damaging to the principles of equality and fairness that affirmative action is intended to promote. This perspective aligns with the overall tone of concern for minority rights and the fear that legal decisions are enabling discrimination under the guise of religious freedom and free speech. The author seems to believe that affirmative action is necessary to counteract systemic inequalities and that recent court decisions have been setbacks in the pursuit of justice and equal treatment for all."	0.02347	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to support affirmative action as they discuss the importance of diversity and the need for improvement in hiring and promoting women and minority faculty members at UC Irvine. The author's support is also inferred from their portrayal of Chancellor Wilkening's and Orange County residents' positive views on diversity and interethnic dialogue, which suggests an alignment with affirmative action policies. The author's mention of disagreement with UC Regent Ward Connerly's anti-affirmative action stance further indicates a supportive perspective on affirmative action.	"Summary:
UC Irvine has been actively engaging its academic community in discussions about diversity for over eight months, led by Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who has been in office for nearly two years. The university is in the process of establishing a Diversity Council, and this initiative is considered timely, especially in light of recent comments against affirmative action by UC Regent Ward Connerly. While diversity and affirmative action are distinct concepts, they are often conflated in debates. A consultant pointed out that UCI shows strong commitment to diversity at the leadership and grassroots levels but needs to bolster support in the middle ranks. The university has made efforts off-campus to promote diversity, such as engaging with high school students and alumni activities like the creation of a cultural mural by UCI graduate Alma L. Lopez. On-campus, UCI boasts a high percentage of Asian students and hosts events to celebrate cultural differences, yet recognizes the need to improve the hiring and promotion of women and minorities as faculty members. Chancellor Wilkening views the university's diversity as a strength, and this sentiment is echoed by Orange County residents, who acknowledge the importance of programs that foster interethnic dialogue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, relating it closely to the broader goal of diversity. They highlight the importance of affirmative action policies by mentioning the need for UCI to improve in hiring and promoting women and minority faculty members. The author also seems to disagree with Ward Connerly's stance against affirmative action, suggesting that diversity efforts, which can include affirmative action, are necessary and beneficial for the community. This is further supported by the mention of the Orange County Annual Survey, which indicates that residents recognize the need for programs that encourage dialogue among different ethnic groups, implying that such programs could include affirmative action measures. Overall, the author presents affirmative action as an integral part of achieving diversity and fostering an inclusive environment."	0.024710000000000003	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action is not the focus of the text and is not clearly outlined. The text only briefly mentions Colin Powell's support for affirmative action as part of his moderate political stance, which the author suggests could appeal to the electorate. The author's view on affirmative action is thus not discernible from the text provided, as it primarily focuses on the political climate and potential candidates rather than on specific policy issues.	"Summary:
The text discusses the lack of enthusiasm in the American electorate for the major-party candidates in the upcoming presidential election. Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican hopefuls like Bob Dole and Phil Gramm are mentioned, but none seem to be generating much excitement. The author attributes this apathy to a combination of unappealing candidate personalities and a broader dissatisfaction with the political process among voters. Attention then shifts to Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is promoting his memoirs and showing signs of a potential political candidacy. Powell's moderate views on various issues are outlined, suggesting he might not fit well within the traditional two-party nominations, particularly the GOP. However, the possibility of a Powell candidacy is supported by the public's desire for an alternative and the strength of Powell's character. The author acknowledges the challenges of running for presidency without a party but suggests Powell could reinvigorate a disenchanted public.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions Powell's stance on affirmative action, noting that he supports it to some degree. This is one of the positions that places Powell in the ""broad, moderate middle,"" according to the author. The text does not delve deeply into the author's personal perspective on affirmative action, but the inclusion of this detail suggests that the author views Powell's support for affirmative action as part of a centrist, potentially appealing political platform that could resonate with a portion of the electorate who are tired of the extremes of the left and right."	0.02275	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Jose Antonio Burciaga, seems to view affirmative action in a positive light, as he negatively characterizes the 'anti-affirmative action initiative' and relates it to other exclusionary politics in California. His discussion of historical racism and his support for Chicano leaders and activists who advocate for the rights of migrants and immigrants suggest that he values social justice and equity, principles that are aligned with the goals of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a reflective piece by Jose Antonio Burciaga, a Northern California writer, on the significance of Cinco de Mayo and its celebration in California amidst the state's political and social climate. Cinco de Mayo commemorates the victory of a poorly equipped Mexican force over the French army in Puebla on May 5, 1862. Burciaga notes the irony of celebrating a Mexican holiday in California at a time when the state is facing financial difficulties, political turmoil, and anti-immigration sentiments (Proposition 187) as well as challenges to affirmative action policies. He expresses a deep connection to California, despite the state's issues, and contrasts his experiences with overt racism in Texas to the subtler forms he encountered in California. Burciaga also reminisces about the cultural impact of California on Texas during his youth and acknowledges the contributions of various leaders and activists to the Chicano movement in California. He concludes by embracing his identity as a Californian and the state's rich Spanish-speaking heritage, ending with a celebratory note for Cinco de Mayo.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Burciaga appears to view affirmative action positively, as indicated by his use of the term ""anti-affirmative action initiative"" to describe a political stance he seems to oppose. The context suggests that he sees the initiative as part of a broader pattern of exclusionary and regressive politics in California, akin to the ""vigilante mood"" reminiscent of historical racism. His negative portrayal of the anti-affirmative action sentiment implies that he likely supports policies that promote inclusion and equality, which affirmative action aims to address. Additionally, his celebration of Chicano leaders and activists who have fought for the rights of migrants and immigrants further underscores his alignment with social justice and equity, values commonly associated with support for affirmative action."	0.03027	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern for the political influences on the University of California's affirmative action policies and appears to sympathize with those who support a more measured approach to implementing changes to such policies. They highlight the political motivations behind the Board of Regents' decisions and seem to value shared governance and thoughtful policy development. While the author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action, their critical view of politically motivated actions against it and support for a more deliberate policy change process suggest they lean towards being in favor of affirmative action, albeit with a nuanced perspective.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political turmoil surrounding the University of California (UC) system's handling of affirmative action policies. In 1967, UC President Clark Kerr was fired by Governor Ronald Reagan, an event that caused outrage among faculty and students who saw it as a politically motivated act. Fast forward to almost 30 years later, the UC system is again at a crossroads with the Board of Regents voting to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring, a move seen as politically influenced by Governor Pete Wilson's presidential campaign. The decision faced opposition from chancellors, student governments, and the Faculty Senate, which called for shared governance. Richard C. Atkinson, the new UC president, delayed the implementation of the new policy to develop alternative guidelines. This led to a conflict with the regents, particularly Ward Connerly, who believed Atkinson overstepped his authority. Atkinson eventually apologized and agreed to expedite the policy change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears critical of the political maneuvering that has influenced the UC system's approach to affirmative action. They suggest that the actions taken by the Board of Regents, particularly in response to Governor Wilson's political ambitions, were partly politically motivated rather than purely educational or principled. The author also seems to support the concept of shared governance and appears sympathetic to Atkinson's efforts to delay the policy for a more thoughtful implementation, despite acknowledging that Atkinson's actions were also political in nature.

The author underscores the negative impact of these political battles on the university's primary mission to educate students, particularly as the university seeks to address systematic race bias and support underprivileged students. The author calls for leadership that can guide the university forward effectively rather than stall progress due to political squabbles."	0.03041	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses a critical viewpoint on affirmative action, highlighting its limitations in addressing the root causes of inequality and its reliance on fixed group identities. They suggest that affirmative action may not effectively serve the most disadvantaged and that it can create tension among different groups. The author's reference to critics like Nathan Glazer and the call for a broader discussion on equality of opportunity indicate a perspective that is questioning the efficacy of affirmative action as it currently stands. However, since the author also acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the potential for overlooking racial or gender injustices, it suggests they are not entirely dismissive of the program's intentions or potential benefits. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'somewhat against' affirmative action, as they raise significant concerns but do not outright reject the concept.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's perspective on affirmative action, arguing that it is a program aimed at redistributing existing inequalities rather than expanding overall opportunities. The author contrasts affirmative action with traditional redistributive programs that are based on economic need rather than race, gender, or ethnicity. They argue that affirmative action operates on a zero-sum basis, where opportunities are taken from one group to be given to another, and it relies on fixed group identities. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue, referencing the potential for overlooking racial or gender injustices when focusing solely on class. They cite sociologist Steven Lukes, who suggests that focusing on one type of injustice can lead to ignoring others. The text also mentions Nathan Glazer, a critic of affirmative action, who expresses concern about the negative impact of eliminating the program on African Americans' perceptions of societal rejection.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of affirmative action, suggesting that it does not address the root causes of inequality and instead redistributes opportunities based on fixed group identities. They believe that efforts should be focused on helping those in need, regardless of their racial or gender group, and that affirmative action may not adequately support those who are most disadvantaged, such as inner-city children. The author argues that affirmative action's focus on race and gender can create tension and overlook the economic concerns of white individuals with modest means. They advocate for a broader discussion on how to achieve true equality of opportunity for everyone, including both the inner-city child and the white janitor's son. The author calls for a balanced debate that honors the truths of both supporters and opponents of affirmative action and suggests that a blue-ribbon commission could be beneficial if it aims to expand the conversation beyond affirmative action to encompass broader equality of opportunity."	0.032440000000000004	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author acknowledges the positive intentions behind affirmative action, such as promoting diversity and racial justice, and admires The Post's commitment to these ideals. However, they also express concern about the negative consequences, including the perception of unfairness among white males and discomfort among black journalists who feel they are seen as hires based on race rather than competence. The author suggests a shift in focus from numerical goals to a principle of absolute nondiscrimination and implies that affirmative action may create division among groups. The nuanced view indicates a recognition of both the benefits and drawbacks of affirmative action without outright rejection or endorsement.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding affirmative action at The Washington Post, which was sparked by a critical article by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic. Shalit accused The Post of lowering its standards to meet affirmative action goals, leading to ""racial strife"" within the organization. The Post's editor, Leonard Downie Jr., and publisher, Donald E. Graham, vehemently denied these allegations, defending the newspaper's hiring practices and commitment to quality. The author of the text acknowledges the challenges of affirmative action, especially in a contracting economy, and the perception among white males that they are disadvantaged by such policies. The author also notes the mixed feelings among black journalists about being labeled as beneficiaries of affirmative action, citing the discomfort with being seen as hired for their race rather than competence. While the author admires The Post's efforts and the importance of a diverse staff, they suggest that the focus should be on nondiscrimination rather than numerical goals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They recognize the value and intentions behind affirmative action policies, particularly in promoting diversity and racial justice. They admire The Post's commitment to these ideals and the importance of a diversified staff. However, the author is also critical of the implementation of affirmative action, noting the emotional impact and perceived unfairness it has on white males who feel they are operating under a quota system. The author is sympathetic to the economic insecurities that make affirmative action harder to sell and the American creed that runs counter to the idea of considering race or sex in hiring. They also understand the discomfort among black professionals who do not want to be viewed as merely the product of affirmative action policies.

Ultimately, the author suggests that while striving for diversity is commendable, the focus should shift from numerical goals to a principle of absolute nondiscrimination. They imply that success should not be measured by reaching certain percentages but by the quality of the output, in this case, a better newspaper. The author's stance is that affirmative action, in its current form, may inadvertently pit groups against each other and that a reevaluation of its goals and methods is necessary."	0.032409999999999994	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses a critical view of affirmative action, highlighting its negative consequences for white men in particular. They present research and anecdotes to argue that affirmative action policies have led to career setbacks for white men and a culture of silence around their grievances due to fear of being labeled as racist. The author's use of terms like 'racial spoils system' and the emphasis on the unfair disadvantage to white men suggest a stance that is against affirmative action, specifically its current implementation. The author calls for a more open discussion on the topic, indicating that while they are not dismissing the need to combat racism, they believe the present approach to affirmative action is flawed and unjust to a certain demographic.	"Summary:
The author explores the impact of affirmative action on white men, a topic that has been largely avoided due to its political sensitivity. Polls suggest that about one in ten white men have been adversely affected by affirmative action policies. The author's research, which includes personal anecdotes and interviews with white men in California, indicates that the negative effects of affirmative action vary by age, geography, occupation, and sector, with younger, public-sector white men with people-oriented skills being the most affected. Many of these men have experienced career setbacks due to preferential hiring and promotion of minorities and women and feel unable to voice their grievances for fear of being labeled racist. The author also discusses the suppression of research that highlights white discontent with affirmative action and criticizes both liberals and conservatives for dismissing or rationalizing the complaints of white men.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, suggesting that it has become a ""racial spoils system"" that unfairly disadvantages white men, particularly in the public sector and academia. He argues that affirmative action policies have been implemented in a manner that creates zero-sum situations where white men are passed over for jobs or promotions in favor of less qualified candidates from minority groups. The author believes that the grievances of white men are often dismissed or suppressed by both political parties, academics, and the media, leading to frustration and cynicism among those affected. He calls for a more open discussion about the impact of affirmative action on white males, without automatically attributing their criticisms to racism. The author's perspective is that while racism should be condemned, it is unjust to ignore the legitimate concerns of white men who feel victimized by affirmative action policies."	0.03931	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of affirmative action as it is currently represented by established civil rights groups and leaders, suggesting that the majority of black Americans prefer merit-based systems. The author cites a survey that shows a significant percentage of black Americans oppose racial preferences in hiring and education. The text argues that affirmative action does not address the real problems of the black underclass and is becoming irrelevant for those who have achieved economic success. The author advocates for empowerment and equal opportunities over a racial spoils system, indicating a stance against the current form of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived differences and actual similarities between black and white Americans' views and aspirations, particularly in the context of the United States 28 years after the Civil Rights Act. It references a survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies which indicates that black Americans largely aspire to the same things as other Americans, including safe streets, good schools, and home ownership. The survey also shows that a significant portion of black Americans identify as conservative, yet few align with the Republican Party due to its history of neglect or hostility towards issues important to black communities. The text highlights several areas where black Americans' opinions diverge from those of established civil rights groups, such as on issues of capital punishment, education, welfare, and homeownership. It also points out the gap between the views of black leaders and the general black population, particularly in relation to affirmative action and busing for school integration. The author suggests that conservative groups have an opportunity to build coalitions with mainstream black Americans on issues of empowerment and upward mobility. The text criticizes both the Republican Party and civil rights leadership for being out of touch with the needs and views of the black community. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of unity and empowerment over a racial spoils system.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action as it is represented by established civil rights groups and leaders. The text suggests that the majority of black Americans prefer merit and ability to be the determining factors in hiring and education decisions, rather than race. The author cites a survey that indicates 77% of black Americans believe in merit over racial preference, which stands in contrast to the views of black leaders who prioritize affirmative action. The author argues that affirmative action, as advocated by these leaders, does not address the real problems facing the black underclass and is increasingly irrelevant to those who have achieved economic success. The text implies that affirmative action is part of a divisive and counterproductive racial spoils system that should be replaced by policies that empower individuals and provide equal opportunities for all, reflecting traditional American ideals. The author's perspective is that the focus should be on empowerment and addressing the actual barriers faced by disadvantaged individuals rather than on redistributive policies based on race."	0.03794	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text seems to align with Clarence Thomas's views on a colorblind Constitution and original-intent jurisprudence, which suggests a preference for individual rights over group rights. By criticizing the reasoning behind the Brown decision and suggesting that affirmative action is 'petty squabbling,' the author indicates a stance against race-conscious remedies and policies like affirmative action. The use of terms like 'judicial activism' and the emphasis on correcting individual discrimination over systemic remedies further imply a critical view of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the NAACP's consideration of opposing a black Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, despite his alignment with Thurgood Marshall's views on equality and the Constitution. The author argues that both Thomas and Marshall shared a belief that the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education should have been based on legal and constitutional grounds, rather than sociological studies. The author criticizes the reasoning behind the Brown decision as the start of judicial activism. The text highlights that both Thomas and Marshall referenced the Declaration of Independence and the Fourteenth Amendment to support a colorblind Constitution and the principle that all men are created equal. The author suggests that Thomas's critics wrongly accuse him of inserting conservative policy preferences through his use of natural rights, while in fact, he seeks to uphold original-intent jurisprudence. The NAACP's Benjamin Hooks acknowledges Thomas's commitment to correcting individual discrimination. The author concludes by noting the similarities between Marshall and Thomas on civil rights and questions whether the NAACP will distance itself from its liberal allies who oppose Thomas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, referencing it as ""petty squabbling"" and suggesting that a better understanding of equality and liberty would elevate the discussion beyond race-conscious remedies. The author also implies that Clarence Thomas is opposed to affirmative action in the form of quotas, as Thomas believes in a colorblind Constitution and adheres to original-intent jurisprudence, which does not support group rights but rather individual liberty and correction of individual discrimination. The author's perspective suggests a preference for a legal approach to civil rights that focuses on individual cases of discrimination rather than systemic remedies like affirmative action."	0.0293	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author presents a critical view of affirmative action, focusing on the negative impacts of race-based admissions policies and the division they cause among students. The author's discussion of Ward Connerly's efforts against race-based admissions and the frustration felt by students who believe merit is not the primary consideration suggests a perspective that is against the current implementation of affirmative action. However, the author also acknowledges the original intent of affirmative action to provide a level playing field, indicating that the author may not be against the concept of affirmative action entirely but rather its current execution. The author's perspective is critical but does not outright reject the idea of affirmative action, so they seem to be somewhat against the current policies but potentially open to reform that aligns with the original goals of affirmative action.	"Summary:
California is actively engaged in efforts to reform affirmative action policies, with initiatives taking place within the University of California system, the state legislature, and through a potential ballot initiative. Ward Connerly, a black University of California regent and friend of Governor Pete Wilson, is a prominent figure leading the charge against race-based admissions policies. Connerly advocates for alternatives to affirmative action, such as marketing the university to underrepresented groups and helping them prepare for applications without considering race or sex in admissions. His stance is not widely supported among the regents, who fear being labeled as racists or Uncle Toms. There is a growing frustration among white and Asian-heritage students who feel that merit is not being adequately considered in admissions. The California Civil Rights Initiative, aimed at eliminating quotas, is facing the challenge of gathering enough signatures and funding to make it onto the 1996 ballot, while facing opposition from businesses that benefit from quotas and without the support of major corporations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action as it currently stands, suggesting that it has strayed from its original intent to help those in need compete on a level playing field and has become more about institutional mandates rather than individual achievement. The author highlights the tension and division affirmative action policies have caused, particularly among students who feel that merit is not the sole criterion in university admissions. The perspective seems to favor a return to the original principles of affirmative action, focusing on individual effort and preparation rather than race-based preferences or quotas. The author also points out the political and financial challenges facing those who wish to reform or dismantle current affirmative action policies in California."	0.02883	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of Governor Weld's stance, which is seen as a betrayal to his initial supporters. The author implies that Weld's endorsement of the affirmative action status quo is a political misstep that alienates his working-class white base and aligns with special interests. The author's use of phrases like 'betrayal' and 'abandonment' indicates a viewpoint that is somewhat against affirmative action, as it is suggested that these policies are causing resentment among white constituents and are part of Weld's deviation from his reformist agenda.	"Summary:
William Weld, a Republican, took over as governor of Massachusetts in 1990 and was initially celebrated for his blend of fiscal conservatism and social libertarianism. However, his popularity has waned among his supporters, especially conservative Democrats, due to controversial decisions such as approving pay raises for state legislators and maintaining a costly requirement for off-duty police to oversee road work. Critics accuse him of abandoning his reformist agenda and aligning with unpopular special interests. His credibility suffered further when he endorsed the affirmative action status quo, alienating his base of working-class white supporters.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Governor Weld's stance on affirmative action. The endorsement of the affirmative-action status quo at a Northeastern University graduation ceremony is portrayed as a betrayal to the ""Weldocrats,"" who are working-class white constituents that once supported him. The author suggests that Weld's defense of affirmative action, influenced by his friendship with an African-American businessman and Democratic activist, Flash Wiley, disregards the concerns of white contractors affected by these policies. Weld is quoted as dismissing the resentment of white males as ""phony assertions"" and justifying affirmative action with the higher unemployment rate among blacks. The author implies that Weld's shift to the left on affirmative action is emblematic of a broader abandonment of his reformist promises and a warning about the integrity of ""new-age fusion Republicanism."""	0.03345	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to believe that economic strategies such as tax cuts and increased capital flow to black-owned businesses could provide a more sustainable solution to racial disparities than affirmative action. By suggesting that these economic measures could 'potentially eliminate the need for affirmative action,' the author seems to imply that affirmative action is not the most effective or desirable approach to achieving racial equality in the long term. Therefore, while the author does not express direct opposition to affirmative action, they do suggest that there could be better alternatives to achieving the goals affirmative action aims for.	"Summary:
The text suggests that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) should support a capital gains tax cut, arguing that it would stimulate economic growth and free up capital for new investments, particularly in black-controlled companies. This, in turn, could create jobs for the constituents of CBC members and potentially eliminate the need for affirmative action. The author points out that venture capital, which would benefit from such a tax cut, is effective in job creation. They also highlight that black businesses, which are mostly privately held, would gain from an increased flow of venture capital. The author suggests that the Department of Labor could encourage pension funds to invest in black-owned businesses and that brokerage firms could help raise capital for these companies. Finally, the author argues that a capital gains tax cut would allow the CBC to form an alliance with the Republican Congress and position its members as adaptable leaders who can deliver for their constituents.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it might become unnecessary if policies are implemented that increase the availability of investment capital for black entrepreneurial endeavors. They imply that economic growth and job creation within black businesses could be a more sustainable solution for addressing racial disparities in employment and wealth. The author believes that empowering black businesses through capital investment and growth would create opportunities for black Americans, potentially reducing the need for affirmative action programs."	0.02434	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of affirmative action is evident through the use of terms like 'quota-driven' and 'quota-mongering,' which carry negative connotations, suggesting a belief that affirmative action should not be about rigid quotas. The concern about affirmative action policies influencing corporate America and the implication that these policies may lack sensitivity and good judgment further indicate a stance against affirmative action as it is currently practiced within the Democratic Party. The author's focus on the potential negative impact of these policies, both within the party and in a broader corporate context, underlines their critical perspective.	"Summary:
The text criticizes President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman as Labor Secretary, questioning the wisdom of the choice given her proximity to a campaign-contributions controversy. It also highlights a memo titled ""Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996,"" which was associated with Herman and suggests a quota-driven approach to political outreach. The author argues that while the Democratic Party's internal affirmative action practices are their own concern, they reflect a broader issue of the party being influenced by its constituent factions. The text suggests that the same affirmative action mindset will continue if Herman becomes Secretary, affecting corporate America and specifically referencing Texaco's racial controversy. The Labor Department, particularly the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, is mentioned as having significant influence over affirmative action practices in corporations. The author concludes by suggesting that the role of Labor Secretary requires someone with better judgment and sensitivity than what they perceive Herman to possess.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, referring to it pejoratively as ""quota-mongering"" and implying that it is a form of racial preference that is institutionalized within the Democratic Party. They also seem concerned that affirmative action policies, as practiced by the Democratic Party, are not merely internal matters but have wider implications for the country, particularly in the corporate sector. The text suggests a belief that affirmative action policies should not be rigidly quota-based and that they may not align with the more moderate rhetoric the party presents to the public. The author seems to advocate for a more nuanced and sensitive approach to affirmative action, one that does not rely on strict quotas or potentially divisive factional demands."	0.0249	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's use of terms like 'useful distinctions' and the critique of the 'all-or-nothing' approach to affirmative action indicate a perspective that recognizes flaws in the current system and calls for a more nuanced debate. The author's support for the Supreme Court's shift towards a color-blind policy in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, as well as the mention of the public's openness to reevaluating affirmative action policies, suggests a critical stance on the issue. However, the author does not appear to be advocating for a complete abolition of affirmative action but rather a reexamination of its applications and a move towards more credible and balanced policies. This indicates that the author is critical but still sees a potential role for affirmative action if reformed.	"Summary:
The text discusses the polarized nature of debates around affirmative action, using the example of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which aimed to end government-sponsored quotas and set-asides. The initiative, which was supported by nearly 30% of black voters, suggests that the public may be open to reevaluating affirmative action policies. The text also details the case of Astroline Communications Company, which benefited from the FCC's minority distress sale policy, but whose minority ownership was called into question. The Supreme Court's shift from supporting racial preferences in Metro Broadcasting v. FCC to a more color-blind approach in Adarand Constructors v. Pena is highlighted. The author suggests that the use of ""useful distinctions"" in public discourse on affirmative action is necessary for credibility and balance, particularly in light of cases that may exploit the system.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the inflexible, ""all-or-nothing"" approach to affirmative action. They argue for the need to reintroduce ""useful distinctions"" into the conversation, implying that there must be room for nuanced debate rather than blanket condemnation or support for such policies. The author points to the CCRI and the case of Astroline Communications as examples where a more balanced, critical approach is warranted. They suggest that the public is becoming more aware of the complexities surrounding affirmative action and may be open to reconsidering its implementation. The author also seems to support the Supreme Court's move towards a color-blind policy, as seen in the Adarand Constructors v. Pena decision, which sets higher standards for government set-aside programs. Overall, the author advocates for a more thoughtful and credible discussion on affirmative action that takes into account the varied and evolving perspectives of the public."	0.02936	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses skepticism towards affirmative action, describing it as a quota system and implying that it may not align with business goals such as downsizing. Furthermore, the author suggests that affirmative action may create stress within organizations and questions its effectiveness as a solution to racial stereotypes. The use of metaphors like 'color-coding jelly beans' indicates a critical view of diversity initiatives that prioritize race and gender. The reference to California voters' decision against racial preferences reinforces the author's stance against the current implementation of affirmative action. While not completely dismissive of the challenges related to race, the author advocates for a balance that prioritizes merit and the core business of companies, indicating a belief that affirmative action in its current form may not be the most effective or fair approach.	"Summary:
The author spent a weekend listening to the Texaco tapes, which were recordings that captured conversations among Texaco employees, including former treasurer Robert Ulrich. The media had alleged that these tapes contained the use of a racial slur and discriminatory remarks. Initially, the tapes were difficult to understand, but after Texaco enhanced the audio, it was revealed that the word thought to be a racial slur was actually ""Nicholas,"" and the term ""black jelly bean,"" which was initially believed to be racist, was actually part of a metaphor for diversity used within the company.

The author criticizes the media for jumping to conclusions without a thorough investigation and suggests that journalists have lost the depth and sensibility that they once aspired to, instead focusing on sensationalism. The tapes, according to the author, actually show Texaco grappling with the challenges of downsizing and affirmative action, with discussions about recruiting from historically black colleges and the advancement of women and minorities within the company.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author appears skeptical of affirmative action, framing it as a quota system that forces companies to focus on hiring based on race and gender rather than merit. There is a suggestion that this focus on diversity may conflict with the business goal of downsizing. The author also implies that there is stress over race within the organization, as evidenced by a conversation about a ""black"" national anthem and a joke about celebrating heritage.

The author also references the California voters' decision against racial preferences, suggesting that while racial stereotypes present real challenges, affirmative action may not be the right solution. The author argues for a balance, maintaining that human dignity involves more than just being sensitive to diversity and that it may be beneficial to retain employees who remember the core business of the company, which is not about ""color-coding jelly beans"" but finding oil."	0.03615	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's mention of affirmative action in a negative context, as part of a broader critique of the ABA's liberal agenda, indicates a critical view of affirmative action. Although the text does not specifically focus on affirmative action, the inclusion of this policy among others that the author disagrees with suggests that the author is likely against affirmative action. The criticism is not the main point of the text but is part of a list of grievances against the ABA, which implies that the author's stance is likely somewhat against rather than strongly against, as there is no detailed argument or strong language used specifically against affirmative action.	"The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for what the author perceives as its liberal agenda and anti-business stance. The ABA has been involved in non-legal matters such as supporting abortion rights, endorsing affirmative action, and advocating for a death penalty moratorium. The author highlights that the ABA has been opposing efforts to reform the tort system, which includes being against various rules and limits that could potentially reduce litigation costs for businesses.

Regarding affirmative action, the author's perspective is implicitly critical, as it is listed among other positions that the ABA has taken which the author disagrees with. The author believes that the ABA's support for affirmative action is part of a broader liberal agenda that is not in line with the legal profession's interests or the ABA's supposed role as a neutral and impartial entity in certifying lawyers and advising on judicial nominations. The text suggests that the ABA's positions on these issues undermine its credibility and impartiality in carrying out its functions. The overall tone indicates that the author is skeptical of the ABA's involvement in social and policy issues, particularly when those stances seem to conflict with business interests."	0.02517	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's stance on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The focus of the text is on the perceived liberal bias in the media and how it affects reporting on various issues, including affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is a topic that is subject to this bias, with the media potentially favoring liberal views on the matter. However, without a clear statement of the author's own position on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize their stance.	"**Summary:**
The text is an opinion piece that criticizes prominent television journalists Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings for denying the existence of a liberal bias in mainstream media, particularly in evening newscasts. The author argues that the perceived bias is not just about being harder on Republicans than Democrats, but about a fundamental worldview that sees liberal opinions as the default or ""reasonable"" perspective. This bias, according to the author, manifests in the labeling of conservative figures while liberal ones are presented without such labels. The author suggests that these media figures are either unaware of their bias or in denial, and that their social circles reinforce their viewpoints, making them blind to alternative perspectives.

**Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:**
The author's perspective on affirmative action is implied rather than explicitly stated. He uses it as an example of an issue where the media's coverage may be influenced by a liberal bias. He points out that the views of liberal activists on topics like affirmative action are often presented uncritically by media elites, while conservative viewpoints on such issues are not given the same treatment. This implies that the author believes affirmative action is one of the social issues where the media fails to present a balanced viewpoint, suggesting that the media might inherently support affirmative action without acknowledging it as a liberal stance. The author criticizes the media for not being as open to groups that oppose affirmative action as they are to those who support it, indicating that he sees a lack of balanced reporting and discussion on the topic within the media landscape."	0.029489999999999995	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author displays a nuanced understanding of the challenges and complexities associated with affirmative action. While they acknowledge the importance of integrating minority employees into a company's culture and the role of informal networks, they also critique the simplistic approaches and unintended negative consequences such as tokenism and stigmatization. The author is critical of the media's portrayal of racial issues and seems to advocate for a more thoughtful and effective implementation of affirmative action policies, rather than outright opposition or endorsement. This suggests that the author is in favor of the goals of affirmative action but seeks a more sophisticated and effective approach to its implementation in corporate settings.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges Coca-Cola faced due to a racial bias lawsuit amidst a series of public relations problems, including a financial downturn, leadership changes, and a health scare in Belgium. The author criticizes the media, particularly Business Week's Dean Foust, for attacking Coke's historical record on race relations without considering the full context, such as the company's efforts to integrate its sales force and CEO Robert Woodruff's support for civil rights. The text also mentions the case of Texaco, where a misinterpreted transcript led to a costly settlement over racism allegations. The author argues that affirmative action has led to complex outcomes, like the clustering of black employees in certain departments, and emphasizes the importance of informal networks for minority employees. The piece suggests that while companies can facilitate diversity, employees must also take initiative, and that corporate attempts at affirmative action can sometimes be counterproductive.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to have a nuanced view of affirmative action, recognizing its complexities and the challenges it can pose within organizations. They point out that hiring minority employees is not the same as integrating them fully into a company's culture and that corporations often struggle to balance fairness to minorities with fairness to others. The author acknowledges the phenomenon of ""clustering"" where minority employees are often placed in visible roles or departments, and the importance of informal networks in helping minority employees navigate corporate environments. They also mention the term ""social trap"" to describe the unintended negative consequences of affirmative action, such as tokenism and stigmatization. Overall, the author appears to support the goals of affirmative action but is critical of simplistic approaches and the media's portrayal of racial issues in corporate settings."	0.03221	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text and is only briefly mentioned in the context of political unrest. The text does not provide enough direct commentary on affirmative action to categorize the author's stance as strongly or somewhat in favor or against. Instead, the mention of affirmative action seems to serve as a narrative device to explore the complexities of policy-making during conflict. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly outlined, and it is challenging to categorize their perspective based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text is a fictional thriller plot set in an alternate reality where a group called the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) seeks to return Texas to Mexico through a violent campaign, including bombings and assassinations. Despite the violence, the American public is depicted as disinterested, and the U.S. government, led by a fictional President Bartlet, negotiates with the HRA, leading to a peace deal that includes significant concessions to the HRA. The author uses this fictional scenario to draw parallels to the real-world situation in Northern Ireland and the British government's handling of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), suggesting that the British government has made too many concessions to terrorists.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is portrayed through a lens of cynicism. In the fictional scenario, affirmative action is mentioned as a benefit that the Latino community receives due to the unrest caused by the HRA. The author implies that while most hard-working Latinos do not support the HRA's violent methods, they are not entirely opposed to the affirmative action that comes as a result of the conflict. This suggests that the author may view affirmative action as a policy that can be manipulated or leveraged in the context of political unrest, rather than purely on the grounds of promoting equality. The reference to affirmative action is brief and serves more to illustrate the unintended consequences or complexities of policy-making in times of conflict rather than to provide a detailed critique of affirmative action itself."	0.03195	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author does not provide a clear personal stance on affirmative action but does describe Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's defense of affirmative action in a potentially negative light by using the term 'demagoguery.' This term often connotes a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. The use of this term suggests that the author may view Townsend's argumentation as pandering or overly simplistic. However, since the author's own views on affirmative action are not directly stated, it is difficult to categorize the stance with certainty. The reference to a Democratic consultant's opinion that Townsend's performance might not resonate with television viewers could imply that the author is somewhat critical of Townsend's affirmative action stance as a campaign strategy. Nevertheless, this is an indirect inference and does not provide conclusive evidence of the author's personal stance on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political situation surrounding Maryland's gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. The author speculates that had Al Gore chosen Townsend as his running mate in 2000, she might have been the Vice President and in a stronger position for the gubernatorial race. Instead, Townsend is struggling against Republican Robert Ehrlich. The author critiques her campaign strategy and choices, such as selecting a white former Republican as her running mate, which upset some black leaders in Baltimore. Ehrlich, on the other hand, chose a black man, Michael Steele, and has been able to capitalize on his working-class background and moderate views. The text also touches on the issue of race in the campaign, with Townsend defending affirmative action in a debate. The outcome of the race may be influenced by the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area and Townsend's use of gun control as a campaign issue. The author suggests that a low voter turnout, potentially due to the sniper attacks, could be detrimental to Townsend's chances of winning.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's perspective on affirmative action during a debate at Morgan State University. Townsend argues forcefully in favor of race-based affirmative action, drawing historical parallels to slavery, lynching, discrimination, and Jim Crow laws, all of which were based on race. She implies that affirmative action is a necessary countermeasure to these historical injustices. The author does not explicitly state their own viewpoint on affirmative action but does describe Townsend's defense of it as ""demagoguery,"" suggesting a critical stance towards her argumentation or perhaps the setting in which it was delivered. The author also reports that a Democratic consultant believed that while Townsend may have ""won the debate in the hall,"" Ehrlich won it on television, indicating that the author thinks Townsend's approach might not resonate with all voters."	0.03569	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text focuses on the political maneuvering around judicial nominations and the influence of special-interest groups. While affirmative action is mentioned in the context of delaying judicial nominees to influence a court case, the author's critique is aimed at the politicization of the judiciary rather than affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action itself cannot be determined with certainty from the given summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses a controversy involving leaked Democratic strategy memos from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which detailed the influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic senators' decisions regarding judicial nominees. The Wall Street Journal published excerpts from these memos, leading to an investigation by the Republican chairman, Senator Orrin Hatch. A GOP staffer on the committee is at risk of losing his job over accusations of leaking the documents, but the author defends him, stating that he did not leak them. The author criticizes the mainstream media for largely ignoring the content of the memos and instead focusing on the leak itself. The memos revealed strategies to block certain judicial nominees for political reasons, including delaying confirmations to influence the outcome of an affirmative action case in the Sixth Circuit. The author questions why the GOP leadership is pursuing the investigation against the staffer, especially when the committee's computer system allowed shared access to the documents without a firewall separating GOP and Democratic staff.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly provide the author's personal opinion on affirmative action, it does reference a specific instance where affirmative action played a role in the political maneuvering described in the leaked memos. The author mentions that Democratic senators were advised to delay judicial nominees to the Sixth Circuit to ensure that the court would sustain an affirmative action program at the University of Michigan. This instance is used to illustrate the author's broader point about the politicization of the judiciary and the influence of special-interest groups on the judicial nomination process. The author seems critical of the tactics used by Democrats to manipulate the judicial system to achieve a desired outcome in an affirmative action case, suggesting a negative view of the politicization involved rather than a direct stance on affirmative action itself."	0.03127	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's mention of affirmative action is limited to its association with political scandals in the context of Chicago politics under the Daley administration. There is no in-depth discussion or analysis of affirmative action as a policy, and the author does not express a clear stance on its merits or shortcomings. The focus is on the political control and effectiveness of the Daley family rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action with the information provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the longstanding political control that the Daley family has exerted over Chicago. Richard J. Daley was the mayor from 1955 until his death in 1976, and his son, Richard M. Daley, took office in 1989 and appears set to continue his tenure. The author mentions occasional challenges to the Daley dynasty, such as criticisms from Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. over affirmative-action contract scandals, but notes that any opposition seems futile. The author describes the corruption that was once rampant under Richard J. Daley's administration and acknowledges that while some level of corruption may still exist, the younger Daley has made significant improvements to the city, making it more appealing to the younger generation. Despite not having grand political ambitions beyond being mayor, Richard M. Daley is seen as highly effective in his role, with a focus on problem-solving and city improvements. The author, Mr. Epstein, concludes by suggesting that the Daleys' success is partly due to their limited ambition and dedication to the role of mayor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat critical and cynical. He references the small and large scandals that are common in Chicago politics, including those related to affirmative-action contracts, implying that such initiatives are not immune to the city's political corruption. However, the text does not delve deeply into the author's views on the policy of affirmative action itself, focusing instead on the political landscape and the Daley family's dominance in Chicago. The mention of affirmative action serves more as an example of the type of scandals that arise in Chicago politics rather than as a subject of in-depth analysis or critique by the author."	0.03227	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author, Peter Berkowitz, clearly rejects the idea of affirmative action for conservatives in the context of academic hiring within political science departments. He emphasizes the importance of knowledge and intellectual rigor over political identity, indicating that he is against the use of affirmative action as a means to address the imbalance of political perspectives in academia. Berkowitz's stance is that educational content should be comprehensive and include conservative ideas, but not by means of affirmative action policies. His position is based on the principle of scholarly standards rather than political representation.	"Summary:
Peter Berkowitz criticizes the lack of courses on conservatism in political science departments at elite universities and colleges. He argues that the exclusion of conservative ideas from the curriculum is not justified intellectually and undermines a liberal education and objective study of political science. Berkowitz points out that conservatism is relevant to American politics and political theory, yet students are seldom exposed to the conservative tradition in American politics. He notes that while courses on various liberal and progressive theories are common, there is a significant gap when it comes to conservative thought, which includes influential thinkers like Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, and Friedrich Hayek. Berkowitz contends that political science students are receiving an incomplete education due to this omission. He rejects the idea of affirmative action for conservatives in academic hiring, emphasizing that knowledge and intellectual rigor should take precedence over political identity. Instead, he suggests that political science departments should include courses on conservative ideas and thinkers to foster a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of political science.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Berkowitz is opposed to affirmative action for conservatives in academic hiring within political science departments. He believes that such a practice would undermine scholarly standards and adopt the flawed assumption that one's political identity is more important than one's knowledge and critical thinking abilities. Berkowitz argues that one does not need to share the identity or beliefs of the subject they study or teach, just as one does not need to be a Puritan to teach about colonial American religious thought or an ancient Israelite to teach biblical thought. He insists that political opinions should not dictate who is qualified to study and teach political ideas, and that conservative ideas should be taught by those with a genuine interest in understanding and conveying them, regardless of their own political leanings. He suggests that incorporating conservative thought in the curriculum should be done to advance liberal education and intellectual diversity, not as a form of affirmative action or political balancing."	0.03212	affirmative action	txt/399053714.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text seems to view Helms's criticism of affirmative action as having some merit, specifically in terms of government overreach. The recognition of 'valid points' suggests that the author sees some legitimacy in Helms's stance against affirmative action. However, the author also identifies a failure on Helms's part to promote a broader social and moral transformation, implying that while affirmative action may have its flaws, there is still a need for efforts to address racial inequality. The author does not seem to fully endorse Helms's position, nor do they reject it outright. Instead, they seem to take a nuanced view that acknowledges both the strengths and weaknesses of Helms's arguments. Given this balance, the author appears to be somewhat critical of affirmative action but also critical of Helms's approach to racial issues.	"Summary:
Jesse Helms, an iconic figure in modern conservatism, passed away at the age of 86. While Ronald Reagan's legacy has been somewhat rehabilitated, Helms remains a controversial figure, particularly among liberals. Helms was a staunch advocate for social conservatism, anti-Communism, limited union power, and a strong foreign policy. He was known for his unwavering stances and political acumen, as demonstrated by his support for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign and his ability to garner attention for his causes despite often being outvoted in the Senate. Helms's views on race and support for authoritarian regimes have tainted his legacy, but he also showed the capacity to change his positions, such as his later support for Israel and efforts to combat AIDS and poverty in Africa. His strategies and use of media have influenced both conservatives and liberals in political campaigning and advocacy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges Helms's criticisms of affirmative action and forced busing as ""on the mark,"" indicating a view that Helms had valid points regarding government overreach in these areas. However, the author also points out that Helms failed to balance his criticism with a call for social and moral transformation in the South and a clear denunciation of racism. This suggests that the author recognizes the complexity of Helms's position on racial issues, acknowledging both the validity of some of his concerns about affirmative action and the shortcomings in his approach to addressing racial inequality. Overall, the author presents Helms as a principled conservative who was often right in his critiques of government policies but lacked a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying social issues."	0.03272	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text, Jason Riley, appears to be skeptical about the effectiveness of affirmative action in improving socioeconomic outcomes for African-Americans. By referencing Thomas Sowell's research that suggests political success does not necessarily lead to economic prosperity, and by questioning the impact of civil rights laws and affirmative action, the author indicates a critical stance on the issue. Furthermore, the text implies that economic gains often precede political gains, which challenges the premise of affirmative action as a tool for economic advancement. The author's skepticism about Obama's policies, which could be seen as forms of affirmative action, reinforces the notion that the author may believe these policies do not effectively address the root causes of socioeconomic disparities and could hinder progress.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential implications of Barack Obama's presidency for African-Americans, examining historical strategies for black advancement, such as economic independence versus integration into political and societal institutions. It references the views of W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington and notes the increase in black elected officials since the 1960s. However, it questions the effectiveness of civil rights laws and affirmative action in improving socioeconomic outcomes for African-Americans, citing Thomas Sowell's research which suggests that political success does not necessarily lead to economic prosperity. The text also compares the experiences of other ethnic groups, such as Germans, Chinese, and Irish, in achieving economic advancement, often without initial political involvement. The author, Jason Riley, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, expresses skepticism about Obama's policies on minimum wage and educational choice, arguing they may hinder rather than help black progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, through the lens of Thomas Sowell's research, presents a critical view of affirmative action and political activity as means to achieve black group advancement. The author suggests that historical evidence does not support the notion that political success, including affirmative action policies, has been a significant factor in the economic rise of various ethnic groups. The text implies that economic gains often precede political gains and that affirmative action might not address the root causes of socioeconomic disparities. The author also highlights potential negative consequences of Obama's policies, such as minimum wage laws and opposition to school vouchers, which could be seen as forms of affirmative action. The perspective is that these policies may not effectively address the challenges faced by African-Americans and could, in fact, create additional barriers to their economic progress."	0.03116	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, uses the incident at IUPUI to criticize the application of affirmative action policies. She views the situation where a student was accused of racial harassment for reading a historical book as an example of overreach and hypersensitivity associated with affirmative action enforcement. Rabinowitz's discussion suggests that she believes such policies can result in unwarranted accusations of racism and create a climate of excessive caution around race issues. Her critical stance on the incident indicates that she is somewhat against the way affirmative action is sometimes implemented, particularly when it leads to what she perceives as absurd outcomes.	"Summary:
The text describes an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) involving a student employee, Keith Sampson, who faced accusations of racial harassment for reading a book titled ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan"" during work breaks. Despite the book being a historical account of students combating the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, Sampson's union representative and an affirmative action officer deemed the book inappropriate and akin to bringing pornography to work. Sampson was formally accused by the university of racial harassment for reading a book with a ""racially abhorrent"" subject in the presence of Black co-workers. After intervention from the ACLU and negative media coverage, the university backtracked, stating it was permissible for Sampson to read scholarly materials during break time and that the initial letter was only addressing conduct that caused concern among co-workers, without specifying what that conduct was. Eventually, University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz expressed regret over the affair. The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, uses the incident to highlight what she perceives as hypersensitivity surrounding race issues, both on college campuses and in the broader political landscape, particularly during the election campaign.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Dorothy Rabinowitz's perspective on affirmative action, as presented in the text, is critical. She suggests that the actions taken by the affirmative action officer at IUPUI were overzealous and misguided. Rabinowitz implies that the affirmative action policies, as applied in this case, led to an absurd situation where reading a historical book was misconstrued as an act of racial harassment. She further criticizes the ""hypersensitivity"" and ""super-heated capacities for perceiving insult"" that she associates with the mindset behind such affirmative action enforcement. Rabinowitz's view is that these policies can lead to an environment where accusations of racism are made too readily, which she sees as a problem not just on college campuses but also in the broader political arena."	0.038470000000000004	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed in the summary provided. The focus of the text is on the political influence and activities of nonprofit foundations, with only a brief mention of their involvement in social issues like civil rights movements, which may include affirmative action. The author raises concerns about the accountability of these foundations and their influence on organizations that participate in affirmative action debates, but does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined based on the information given.	"**Summary:**

The text discusses the influence and activities of America's nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations, focusing on their roles in political and social spheres. Thirty years prior, there was an investigation into these foundations, revealing some acted as channels for CIA funds during the Cold War. The media's interest in these foundations has since waned, and they are often overlooked or seen as benign entities. However, the author highlights that these organizations have significant political influence, often flouting rules against lobbying. The number of foundations has nearly doubled in about 15 years, with their assets exceeding $200 billion. They fund a range of activities from civil rights movements to welfare state expansion, and they have a considerable impact on policy-making and public discourse. The text also notes that some foundations can influence organizations like the NAACP and MALDEF, raising questions about accountability. The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts have promoted ""civic journalism,"" which has faced criticism for potentially compromising press independence. The author argues that foundations should be subject to more public scrutiny and debate, given their growing significance.

**Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:**

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. However, the author does mention foundations' involvement in social issues, including affirmative action, as part of their broader political influence. The text references the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), an organization that has been a prominent player in debates over immigration and affirmative action and is primarily funded by foundations like the Ford Foundation. The author seems to question the legitimacy and accountability of such organizations, given their lack of a member base and heavy reliance on foundation funding. This could imply a concern that the foundations' influence on affirmative action and similar policies may not accurately reflect the interests or will of the communities they claim to represent. The author's focus is more on the need for transparency and accountability of foundations in their political activities rather than a direct stance on affirmative action itself."	0.03427	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They acknowledge the historical necessity of such policies due to racial discrimination and the ongoing lack of racial fairness. However, they also express skepticism towards the idea that affirmative action should be solely about racial entitlement. The author criticizes the polarized nature of the debate and suggests that a balanced approach is needed, one that moves towards a society where race does not determine one's opportunities. While they hint at the need for measures to address historical imbalances, they also emphasize the ultimate goal of a society where individual merit is the key determinant of success. This perspective indicates that the author is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its role in addressing past injustices while also seeking a future where affirmative action is no longer necessary.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the debate surrounding affirmative action, particularly in the context of recent events such as the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the controversy over Bill Lann Lee's nomination. The author observes that both sides of the debate hold onto oversimplified truths. One side claims racial discrimination is a relic of the past, while the other insists that opposition to affirmative action is rooted in racism. The author acknowledges that while blatant segregation has diminished, racial fairness is still not a reality in many sectors. The author criticizes the polarized nature of the debate and suggests that most people desire fairness and equality, regardless of race. The discussion extends to the broader political landscape and judicial processes, citing the trial of Louise Woodward as an example of oversimplification in argumentation. The author concludes by contemplating the means to achieve a society where race does not determine one's opportunities, referencing the increasing number of black quarterbacks in the NFL as a sign of progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view on affirmative action. They recognize the historical necessity of such policies due to past and ongoing racial discrimination, but they also seem skeptical of the idea that affirmative action should be about racial entitlement or drawing districts solely based on race. The author seems to advocate for a middle ground, acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the need for a societal shift towards fairness and equality that transcends race. They suggest that the ultimate goal should be a society where individual merit, rather than skin color, is the determining factor for success, but they also seem to understand that achieving this goal may require measures that address historical imbalances, at least temporarily. The author implies that affirmative action, or similar policies, might be necessary to ""level the playing field"" before a truly colorblind society can be realized."	0.03058	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author reflects on the history and ongoing challenges of racial integration and recognizes the importance of affirmative action in maintaining progress towards racial equality. By pointing to the decline in minority enrollment after the removal of affirmative action rules, the author indicates a belief in the positive role of such measures. The call for a national conversation about race and the emphasis on the dignity of every person further suggest that the author views affirmative action as part of a larger societal effort to address racial disparities and promote inclusion.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 40th anniversary of the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, by nine African American students. The author recounts their own experiences with racial integration and the challenges they faced as an African American teenager in Arkansas, including being barred from school activities after participating in a sit-in. The author notes the progress that has been made since then, with a growing African American middle class and desegregation in various public domains. However, they also highlight the persistence of subtle, insidious forms of racism and the decline in minority enrollment following the removal of affirmative action rules. The author calls for an honest national conversation about race to build a society that honors the dignity of every person, emphasizing that while laws can change institutions, they cannot change people's hearts. The writer is identified as the secretary of transportation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary measure to combat subtle forms of racism and to ensure economic and educational opportunities for minorities. They point to the negative impact on minority enrollment at state universities when affirmative action rules are lifted as evidence of its importance. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action is a tool to address ongoing disparities and to work towards a society that respects and honors differences among people. They imply that affirmative action is part of the broader effort to cope with societal interdependence and to see the value in every individual, regardless of race."	0.026010000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's nuanced view suggests that they recognize the complexity of the issue, understanding both the legal challenges to affirmative action and its potential benefits. They acknowledge the problematic aspects of the University of Michigan's previous admissions policy but seem to believe that race can be a factor in admissions if it aligns with the Bakke decision. The criticism of the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas indicates a disapproval of moving away from affirmative action without clear guidance from the Supreme Court. This suggests the author is in favor of affirmative action within certain legal constraints and is critical of actions that might prematurely undermine it.	"Summary:
Jennifer Gratz filed a lawsuit against the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, arguing that it discriminated against her because she is white. Her case, supported pro bono by the Center for Individual Rights, is based on the claim that the university's guidelines instructed admissions officers to treat minority applications differently, potentially violating the Supreme Court's 1978 decision in University of California Regents v. Bakke, which allowed race to be a factor in admissions but not to the extent of excluding any candidate from full consideration. The university has since revised its admissions system, possibly in response to such concerns. The case raises questions about the role of race in admissions and whether the Bakke ruling still stands, especially after the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas against the use of race in law school admissions. This decision was made without waiting for the Supreme Court to change its stance on the matter, and it's uncertain whether the Supreme Court will follow this direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view on affirmative action. They acknowledge the constitutional issues raised by Jennifer Gratz's lawsuit and the problematic nature of the University of Michigan's previous admissions guidelines. However, they also suggest that it is premature to judge the admissions system without all the evidence, noting the complexity of admissions decisions and the fact that the university gives preferential treatment based on other factors besides race.

The author seems to support the idea that race can be a factor in admissions, provided it is within the narrow circumstances allowed by the Bakke decision. They criticize the Fifth Circuit's Hopwood decision for prematurely deciding on an important constitutional question and suggest that the Supreme Court has not yet made it clear that Bakke is no longer valid law. The author implies that there is still a constitutional and cultural place for affirmative action in public university admissions to foster diversity, indicating a belief that affirmative action, when narrowly applied, is still a constitutional approach."	0.02833	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be definitively categorized based on the provided summary, as the author does not explicitly state a stance on the policy. The text merely discusses affirmative action in the context of potential conflicts with international trade agreements, such as the MAI, and the concern that such agreements could challenge domestic policies like affirmative action. The author's focus is on the implications of international treaties for local laws rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not the central concern of the text, and there is insufficient information to categorize their perspective.	"Summary:
Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland state legislator, was surprised when high-level officials lobbied against his proposal to sanction companies operating in Nigeria due to human rights abuses. The U.S. is increasingly involved in shaping foreign societies through trade negotiations that now address ""non-tariff barriers"" like corruption, antitrust laws, and regulations. Countries are not always receptive to U.S. initiatives and can demand compensation under international treaties if their companies are barred, as in the case of Maryland's proposed anti-Nigeria law. Alan Larson, from the State Department, is involved in negotiating the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI), which seeks to protect foreign investments and has faced criticism for potentially undermining local laws and regulations. There is concern that MAI could affect a wide range of domestic policies, but U.S. officials argue it would not impact existing laws and would benefit American workers. The Clinton administration, cautious after the defeat of fast-track trade legislation, is taking more time to negotiate MAI and is consulting with various domestic stakeholders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action in the context of potential conflicts with the MAI. The implication is that the treaty could challenge domestic policies like affirmative action if they were considered to be discriminatory against foreign companies. While the author does not explicitly state their perspective on affirmative action, they raise it as an example of a local policy that might be at risk under international agreements like the MAI. This suggests a concern for the preservation of affirmative action and other domestic laws in the face of global trade agreements. The author's inclusion of affirmative action among other important social regulations indicates an understanding of its significance within the broader spectrum of American legislative concerns."	0.03119	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to focus on the progress made by African Americans in higher education and emphasizes the importance of understanding and building upon these successes. However, there is no explicit mention of affirmative action or a direct indication of the author's stance on the policy. The discussion of progress and areas for improvement in the context of African American advancement in higher education suggests a recognition of the challenges faced and the need for continued efforts. Without a clear statement on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately determine the author's perspective on the policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the advancements of African Americans in higher education over two decades, as highlighted in a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education."" The author speaks with Michael T. Nettles, a University of Michigan professor and executive director of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute. Nettles shares that there has been a significant increase in African American students receiving baccalaureate degrees, with a 50 percent increase between 1976 and 1996. This growth is seen across various types of institutions and regions, with the South leading. Despite these gains, there are still areas for improvement, such as enrollment rates, graduation rates, faculty representation, and the academic performance of black freshmen. The text also highlights the gender disparity in higher education, with a significant majority of African American undergraduates being women. The author agrees with Nettles's positive outlook on the progress made but also recognizes that understanding where successes lie is crucial for continued advancement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action. However, it appears that the author acknowledges the progress made by African Americans in higher education and believes in building upon these successes. The positive trends in enrollment and graduation could be seen as an argument for the effectiveness of affirmative action policies, although the author does not directly link these outcomes to such policies. The author's focus on the need to understand and build upon areas of success suggests a belief in targeted efforts to support continued progress, which could align with the principles of affirmative action. Nevertheless, without a direct statement from the author on their stance, any interpretation of their perspective on affirmative action remains speculative."	0.02827	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses skepticism towards affirmative action, suggesting that it might perpetuate racial divisions rather than help overcome them. The criticism of identity politics and the implication that affirmative action is part of a 'racial spoils system' indicate a negative view of such policies. The author's use of terms like 'plague' to describe the obsession with identity politics and the suggestion that moral certitude on racial issues could alienate people further supports the interpretation that the author is critical of affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance appears to be against affirmative action, though the summary does not provide enough evidence to determine if the opposition is strong or moderate.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political landscape during a time when Bill Bradley and Al Gore were prominent figures, likely during a campaign period. The author critiques Gore's track record and public statements, suggesting that his claims and the confidence with which he presents them may come across as morally condescending. The author then shifts focus to Bradley, particularly his views on race and affirmative action. Bradley is described as earnest in his speech at Cooper Union, where he called for racial healing and candid discussion, criticizing white indifference and black suspicion, and pointing out stereotypes. The author recalls Bradley's past confrontations with President Bush and Ronald Reagan on racial issues, and his commentary on the Los Angeles riots. Bradley's emphasis on race is linked to identity politics, which the author suggests might be counterproductive to overcoming racial divisions. The text questions whether Bradley's approach to racial honesty and his support for affirmative action and categorical representation might actually hinder progress towards a society where race exists but does not matter.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. The author implies that Bradley's approach, which includes support for affirmative action and categorical representation, may not be conducive to achieving a society where race no longer matters. The author seems to suggest that such policies, which are part of what the author calls ""the racial spoils system,"" could perpetuate divisions rather than help overcome them. The author criticizes the Democratic party's obsession with identity politics and race, indicating that it could be a ""plague"" that hinders honest discussions and progress on racial issues. The author also implies that Bradley's moral certitude on the issue of race may alienate those with differing opinions, framing it as a moral failing rather than a legitimate difference in perspective. Overall, the author is skeptical of the effectiveness of affirmative action and similar policies in achieving racial harmony and equality."	0.03081	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, John Harris, does not express a personal opinion on affirmative action. Instead, he discusses it in the context of political strategy and the shift in American politics towards elite consensus. Harris describes how both Republican and Democratic politicians have moderated their stances on affirmative action, with Republicans muting opposition and Democrats like Clinton advocating for a 'mend it, don't end it' approach. This suggests that Harris views affirmative action as an issue that is being pragmatically managed by politicians rather than as a matter of strong ideological conviction. Therefore, he does not take a clear stance in favor or against affirmative action but rather analyzes the political handling of the issue.	"Summary:
The article discusses the shift in American politics away from populism and towards the acceptance of elite leadership, as exemplified by the presidencies of Bill Clinton and the potential candidacies of Al Gore and George W. Bush in the 2000 election. It highlights how Clinton's personal scandals and the success of the U.S. economy under his administration have contributed to a national consensus that the country's leaders may be doing an acceptable job. The article also notes the irony of Clinton, who ran as a populist, becoming a president who made politics safe for the educated elite. It mentions the use of polling to strategically address populist concerns, the public's support for elite-driven initiatives like gun control and foreign intervention, and the decline of populist movements such as term limits. The author, John Harris, suggests that the next president, whether Gore or Bush, will likely continue to promote centrist policies and maintain the prosperity of the Clinton years.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
John Harris discusses affirmative action within the context of the changing political landscape. He notes that tolerance has become the new ethos of national politics, replacing the previous era's populist grievances. He specifically mentions how presidential candidates like Bush and Elizabeth Dole have sought to mute traditional Republican opposition to affirmative action. Harris also highlights Clinton's nuanced stance on affirmative action with the phrase ""mend it, don't end it,"" which he sees as an example of how polling can inform elite politicians on how to accommodate populist sentiments in a precise and strategic manner. The author's perspective suggests that he views affirmative action as one of the issues that have been moderated and reshaped by elite consensus and strategic political maneuvering, rather than being driven by populist sentiment. Harris does not explicitly offer a personal opinion on affirmative action, but he presents it as an issue that has been defused and managed through the calculated approach of politicians like Clinton."	0.04045	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical reference to conservative opposition to affirmative action as 'Satan's own tool' indicates a disapproval of the conservative stance against affirmative action. The author's discussion suggests that while conservatives may support black candidates who share their views, this does not necessarily equate to genuine racial progress. The author seems to believe that real progress would involve taking into account the wider interests of the black community, which likely includes support for affirmative action policies. Therefore, the author appears to advocate for affirmative action and is critical of those who oppose it based on a conservative political philosophy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's reflections on white conservative voters' responses to black political candidates, particularly Alan Keyes, who had a surprising third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses. The author questions whether white voters can truly look beyond a black candidate's race, noting that black and white Americans have different perspectives on this issue. The author recalls a televised interview with white conservatives who seemed to focus on issues rather than race when discussing Keyes. The author also mentions Strom Thurmond's support for Clarence Thomas, suggesting that Thurmond's support was based on political philosophy rather than race. The author acknowledges that white conservatives may support black candidates with views that differ from the majority of black voters and questions whether this implies a disregard for the broader black community's opinions. The text concludes with the author's suggestion that there may be hope for racial progress if conservatives can focus on character and philosophy over race, and that this progress could extend to white liberals as well.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the conservative viewpoint on affirmative action, characterizing it as ""Satan's own tool."" This suggests that the author disagrees with conservative opposition to affirmative action and may view it as a necessary policy to address racial inequality. The author's mention of this topic in the context of discussing conservative voters' ability to support black candidates indicates a belief that conservatives can overlook race if a black candidate shares their anti-affirmative action stance, even though such a stance might be unpopular with the majority of black voters. The author seems to challenge the notion that supporting black candidates with conservative views is sufficient evidence of racial progress, implying that true progress would involve considering the broader interests and perspectives of the black community."	0.0279	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern about the future of affirmative action, indicating that it is an important issue for them. They are worried about the potential impact of the Democratic Leadership Council's rise on affirmative action policies. The author's call for transparency in disclosing potential cabinet members is tied to a desire to understand the candidates' commitment to diversity and affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action, their concern about the policy's future and the importance of maintaining diversity suggests that they are at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the lack of transparency regarding potential presidential appointments before the elections. It highlights the importance for voters to know who will be part of the administration of either Al Gore or George W. Bush, as these individuals will significantly influence national policy. The author criticizes the fact that aside from Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who are mentioned in connection with Bush, there is little information on who would form the teams of either candidate. The commentary suggests that revealing potential cabinet members before the election would allow voters to better understand the candidates’ commitments to diversity and policy directions. The author also points out a shift in the Democratic Party, with the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group, gaining prominence, which raises questions about the potential impact on affirmative action and other policies. The text argues for early disclosure of cabinet choices, not only for reasons of diversity but also to inform voters about the people who would shape policies in various areas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is concerned about the future of affirmative action and related policies under the new administration. They note that while African Americans and other voters of color are likely to support Gore due to the Clinton administration's record on diversity and civil rights, there are concerns about whether the rise of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) will lead to a rollback in affirmative action. The author implies that affirmative action is an important policy for maintaining diversity and addressing inequalities, and suggests that by disclosing their potential cabinet and administrative appointments, candidates could alleviate concerns about their commitment to these policies. The perspective is that transparency in potential appointments would provide insights into whether the candidates would continue to support affirmative action or if there might be a shift in policy under their administration."	0.03198	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author acknowledges that Senator Lieberman has questioned affirmative action in the past, indicating that he may have some reservations or a nuanced stance on the issue. However, the author also notes that Lieberman has aligned himself with the Democratic Party's support for affirmative action during his speech at the Democratic National Convention. The author seems to view Lieberman's past engagement with the complexities of affirmative action positively, suggesting that it reflects innovative thinking and candidness. Nonetheless, the author also understands the political need for Lieberman to conform to his party's views during the convention. The author's perspective appears to be appreciative of Lieberman's openness to discussion and potential challenges to the status quo, but there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action itself. Given the lack of explicit support or opposition to affirmative action in the text, and the focus on Lieberman's political maneuvering rather than the policy itself, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance definitively.	"Summary:
Joseph Lieberman, introduced at the Democratic National Convention as the first Jewish vice-presidential nominee of a major party, presented himself as embodying the American dream. His speech emphasized shared values like faith, family, hard work, and public service. While Lieberman has a reputation for integrity and bipartisanship, his past criticisms of Democratic policies and President Clinton's ethical lapses have created tension within the party. During his speech, Lieberman aligned himself with mainstream Democratic views, avoiding controversial topics such as tort reform and school vouchers, which he previously supported. He emphasized agreement with Al Gore on healthcare, environmental policies, and critiquing Republican tax plans. Lieberman has been known for acknowledging complex issues like affirmative action and education reform, suggesting schools should be held to high standards of performance and accountability.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author notes that Senator Lieberman has previously questioned affirmative action, indicating a nuanced view on the issue. However, during his speech, Lieberman endorsed affirmative action in an attempt to align with the Democratic Party's stance and avoid alienating core constituents. The author seems to suggest that Lieberman's past willingness to engage with the complexities of affirmative action is a sign of his innovative thinking and refreshingly candid approach to policy discussions. The author appears to appreciate this openness and willingness to challenge traditional positions, which could bring new ideas to the Democratic Party. However, the author also recognizes the political necessity for Lieberman to present a united front with his party's platform during the convention."	0.028399999999999998	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author discusses concerns about John Ashcroft's potential influence on law enforcement policy as attorney general, particularly in light of his conservative views. While the author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action, they highlight Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to Lee's support for affirmative action. This reference is used to illustrate the potential for personal beliefs to affect legal judgment, suggesting that Ashcroft's stance on affirmative action could influence his policy decisions as attorney general. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not the focus, but rather how Ashcroft's views on the matter might impact his role. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly outlined, and they appear to be neutral, focusing instead on the implications of personal beliefs in the context of a judicial role.	"Summary:
The text discusses the debate surrounding John Ashcroft's nomination for attorney general. Opponents are searching for reasons to deem him unfit, while supporters argue his qualifications and fairness. The author suggests that the role of attorney general goes beyond simply enforcing laws; it involves setting law enforcement policy and deciding on the focus and allocation of resources. The author questions what it means to enforce laws ""fairly,"" using drug laws as an example of the discretionary nature of enforcement. The concern is that Ashcroft, known for his conservative stances on various issues, may let his ideology influence his policy decisions. The author references Ashcroft's own opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to Lee's beliefs on affirmative action, suggesting that the same logic could apply to Ashcroft.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies that Ashcroft's perspective on affirmative action is negative, given that he opposed Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil rights division due to Lee's support for affirmative action. Ashcroft believed Lee's beliefs would limit his ability to remain balanced in his judgments. This indicates that Ashcroft likely views affirmative action as a policy that could impede objectivity in legal decision-making. The author uses this stance to argue that Ashcroft's own personal and religious views could similarly influence his role as attorney general, potentially affecting his enforcement of the law and policy-making decisions."	0.02629	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not clearly articulated in the text. The summary provided focuses on a range of topics and only briefly touches upon affirmative action in the context of the Bush administration's appointments. The author presents statistical data on the diversity of appointments in the Bush administration compared to previous administrations, but does not offer a personal opinion or a clear argument in favor of or against affirmative action. Instead, the author appears to be reporting on the administration's stance and actions without direct commentary or analysis on the policy of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses various topics, starting with the Bush administration's controversial decision to rescind a Clinton-era regulation that lowered arsenic levels in drinking water. Jonathan Adler from the Competitive Enterprise Institute criticized the administration's handling of the issue, attributing the backlash to poor communication and the incompetence of environmental journalists. He suggested that the administration should have emphasized the continued regulation of arsenic and the lack of industry beneficiaries from the decision. The text also mentions environmentalists' counterarguments, noting that the old federal standard for arsenic was outdated and that the new European standard was stricter.

The text then shifts to political fundraising, mentioning a fundraiser at the Clinton home for Senator Maria Cantwell, and notes the sale of Dan Burton cufflinks on eBay.

In terms of diplomatic appointments, the text mentions President Bush's intention to appoint Charles A. Heimbold Jr. as ambassador to Sweden and discusses other potential ambassadorial appointments.

Finally, the text touches upon the Bush administration's stance on affirmative action, noting that 40 percent of Bush's top-tier position announcements have been women and minorities. This is compared to the diversity in appointments made by previous administrations, with Clinton having 37 percent women and 15 percent African Americans, and Reagan having 10 percent women and 8 percent African Americans.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not extensively discussed in the text. However, the author does present data on the Bush administration's appointments, stating that there is ""no affirmative action here"" according to the administration, yet highlighting that a significant portion of Bush's appointments for top-tier positions requiring Senate confirmation have been women and minorities. The author provides comparative figures from the Clinton and Reagan administrations, possibly to contextualize the Bush administration's record on diversity in appointments. The mention of the administration's claim of not practicing affirmative action, juxtaposed with the statistics showing a relatively high percentage of diverse appointments, may imply a subtle critique or skepticism regarding the administration's stance."	0.029930000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of conservatives' inconsistent approach. While conservatives claim to support a strict constructionist interpretation of the Constitution, they are accused of being willing to embrace judicial activism when it serves their purpose, such as in the case of opposing affirmative action. The author's critique of the conservative stance, particularly their selective opposition to nominees based on their views on affirmative action, implies that the author is critical of the conservative approach to affirmative action. However, the author's own stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, only their view on the conservative approach to it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the conservative interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, particularly concerning the ""advice and consent"" clause in relation to the appointment of judges. Conservatives argue for a strict constructionist approach to the Constitution, except when it comes to this clause, where they impose additional limitations on the Senate's role. They differentiate between a nominee's political ideology, which they believe should not be considered, and their judicial philosophy, which should be scrutinized. However, conservatives are accused of inconsistency, as they often overlook their own judicial philosophy when it is inconvenient, such as with affirmative action. The author argues that the Senate has the right to closely examine nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject them on that basis, including asking about specific legal issues. The text also critiques the conservative stance on blocking Clinton's nominees and their selective approach to opposing nominees based on their views, as exemplified by the Institute of Justice's position on affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that conservatives have a contradictory stance on affirmative action. On one hand, they advocate for judicial restraint and strict construction of the Constitution, but on the other hand, they are willing to support judicial activism when it aligns with their goals, such as overturning affirmative action policies. The author implies that conservatives use the Constitution selectively to advance their political agenda, rather than adhering to a consistent judicial philosophy. The mention of the Institute of Justice's campaign against Bill Lann Lee, a nominee who did not oppose affirmative action, illustrates this point. The author appears critical of the conservative approach to affirmative action, indicating that their use of buzzwords like ""strict construction"" and ""original intent"" does not provide a clear guide to constitutional interpretation, especially when dealing with complex or evolving societal issues."	0.032	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text but is referred to in the context of political strategy. The text discusses how Bill Clinton, as a president, was an 'unwavering champion' of his core supporters' nonnegotiables, which included affirmative action. The author's emphasis is on the political intelligence of presidents in handling core issues rather than on a personal stance on affirmative action. Therefore, the author's own perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and it is not possible to categorize the author's stance based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text is an analysis of President Bush's political intelligence and his ability to improve public opinion about his presidency. The author argues that Bush's success is not just due to low expectations, a weak predecessor, his charm, or a focused agenda, but also to his political intelligence, which is distinct from verbal intelligence. The author admits to previously underestimating Bush's intelligence, having mistakenly equated poor verbal skills with a lack of overall intelligence. Bush is compared to Bill Clinton in his strategic understanding of voter dynamics, specifically the concept of triangulation. Both presidents understood the importance of satisfying their ideological core, neutralizing opposition from their anti-core, and appealing to swing voters. The author gives examples of how Bush has satisfied his core on issues like abortion and taxes while also making strategic concessions on issues like racial profiling to appeal to swing voters without alienating his base.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as one of the nonnegotiable core issues for Bill Clinton's base during his presidency. Clinton is described as an ""unwavering champion"" of his core's nonnegotiables, which included affirmative action, among others. By firmly supporting affirmative action, Clinton was able to meet the absolute demands of his core supporters, allowing him flexibility on other issues and enabling him to win over swing voters. The author implies that affirmative action was a key part of the political strategy that allowed Clinton to maintain support from his base while also shedding unpopular positions that previously marginalized Democrats. This perspective suggests that the author recognizes the political significance of affirmative action as a crucial issue for a segment of the electorate and as a strategic tool in the broader context of political triangulation."	0.028350000000000004	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text presents a critique of the intellectual homogeneity within academia and suggests that affirmative action, in terms of intellectual diversity, is not truly practiced. The emphasis is on the lack of diversity of thought, particularly the marginalization of conservative views in higher education. By highlighting the dominance of liberal views and the exclusion of those who disagree with certain prevailing ideologies, such as affirmative action, the author implies that academia does not accommodate a spectrum of perspectives. The specific mention that opposing affirmative action would be a barrier in fields like African-American studies indicates a somewhat against stance towards the current implementation of affirmative action in academia.	"Summary:
The article discusses the political imbalance in academia, where studies have found that liberal professors significantly outnumber conservative ones. It cites studies showing Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least seven to one in the humanities and social sciences, and the imbalance is growing with younger professors being more liberal than the ones retiring. Voter registration records from institutions like Berkeley, Stanford, Cornell, and UCLA also show a heavy liberal dominance. The University of California system and Harvard were top contributors to John Kerry over George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential campaign.

The article mentions George Lakoff's view that conservatives are less interested in academic careers because they do not prioritize the public good and social justice as liberals do. Mark Bauerlein suggests that academia's ""sheltered habitat"" excludes conservatives through a filtering process that starts from graduate school admissions to tenure decisions. He points out that certain academic fields have political orientations embedded in their definitions of scholarship, effectively barring those with opposing views.

Bauerlein also discusses the ""false consensus effect"" and ""the law of group polarization,"" which lead to extreme views and tone-deafness to outsiders within academically homogeneous groups. The article concludes by noting that while universities proclaim diversity, they have become intellectually monochrome, focusing on diversity of race, skin color, ethnicity, and sexual preference, but not of thought.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to take a critical stance on affirmative action within the context of academia. Bauerlein's statement, ""If you disapprove of affirmative action, forget pursuing a degree in African-American studies,"" implies that certain academic fields have a predetermined stance on issues like affirmative action that must be accepted to participate in those fields. The author suggests that such a stance excludes individuals who hold opposing views, thus limiting intellectual diversity. This perspective is part of a broader critique of the ideological conformity the author perceives in higher education, where liberal views are dominant and conservative views are marginalized."	0.03101	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text. The text focuses on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's role in the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action and her ideological shift, rather than the author's personal views on the policy itself. Since the author refrains from providing their own stance on affirmative action, choosing instead to report on the influence of a Supreme Court justice's views on the policy, the author's stance cannot be determined from the given summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's reticence to disclose detailed information about Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health after it was revealed he had thyroid cancer. This discretion is part of a long-standing tradition of the court, which some argue should change given the court's significant role in policymaking. Opinions are divided, with some believing the public has a right to know about the Chief Justice's health, while others argue the judiciary operates differently from other government branches and does not require the same level of transparency.

The text also highlights Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's influential role on the Supreme Court, noting her position as the ""median voter"" and her gradual ideological shift to the left, as evidenced by a quantitative study. This shift is said to have been crucial in the court's 5-4 decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions in 2003, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action but reports on the findings of a study that suggests Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's leftward shift was pivotal in the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions. The study indicates that without O'Connor's evolving views, the likelihood of affirmative action being approved by the court would have been much smaller prior to 2001. This information is presented as part of a broader discussion on O'Connor's influence on the court's decisions, rather than as a critique or endorsement of affirmative action policies."	0.02536	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt	3
	None	The text provided does not directly address the author's stance on affirmative action. The discussion revolves around the broader topic of judicial independence and the politicization of the judiciary, rather than affirmative action specifically. The mention of affirmative action is only in the context of illustrating the types of controversial cases the judiciary handles and how the court's decisions tend to align with the views of the majority. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the information given.	"Summary:
The text discusses the increasing threats and personal attacks on judges in the United States, particularly in light of the Terri Schiavo case. It describes how both liberals and conservatives have been politicizing the judiciary, using courts to resolve issues that politics cannot, and attacking judges when decisions don't go their way. The author argues that this undermines judicial independence and disrespects the judiciary. The text also touches on the historical context of judicial independence being challenged by Congress and notes that judges generally reflect the constitutional views of national majorities. Interest groups on the political extremes are identified as a significant factor in the politicization of judicial nominations. The author suggests that judges should resist the spotlight, follow the law, and avoid grandiose assertions of judicial supremacy to maintain their independence and public respect.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not focus solely on affirmative action, it does mention that in controversial cases involving issues like affirmative action, gay rights, and access to early-term abortions, the Rehnquist court tended to support the views of a narrow majority of the American people. The author implies that the court's decisions on affirmative action, among other issues, reflect the constitutional views of national majorities rather than being anti-democratic or elitist, as some critics claim. The author, Jeffrey Rosen, seems to argue against the notion that judges are ""tyrannical activists"" and suggests that in reality, their decisions often align with the majority public opinion, which would include affirmative action policies."	0.03389	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	3
	None	The text provided does not mention affirmative action or provide any insight into the author's perspective on the topic. The discussion is centered around the influence of interest groups in Washington politics and their impact on the national agenda, without any specific reference to affirmative action. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the given summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses how interest groups, rather than political leaders or parties, increasingly dictate the agenda in Washington, D.C. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, believes that Social Security is not the nation's biggest fiscal problem compared to Medicare and Medicaid. However, interest groups have managed to make Social Security, the Terri Schiavo case, and judicial nominations top priorities in Washington. Organizations like AARP, the Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce shape public discourse and influence civic debates. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) is highlighted for its successful lobbying efforts to repeal the inheritance tax. Interest groups are now deeply involved in elections and policymaking, often overshadowing the role of political parties. The article also notes that while some issues like Social Security receive significant attention due to the backing of powerful interest groups, other important issues such as Medicaid and international crises like famine and HIV/AIDS receive less attention due to the lack of similarly influential advocacy. The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, is a Washington Post reporter with expertise in the intersection of business and politics.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action. The article focuses on the influence of interest groups in Washington politics and how they shape the national agenda on various issues, including judicial nominations, which may indirectly touch on matters like affirmative action. However, without a direct statement or analysis from the author on the topic of affirmative action, we cannot determine his perspective on it based on the provided text."	0.03865	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly the main focus of the text, which is primarily about Tel Aviv's history, culture, and evolution. However, the text does mention affirmative action policies in the context of Tel Aviv's efforts to be inclusive and tolerant, and the author seems to present this in a positive light, as part of the city's identity. Nevertheless, the text also acknowledges the complexities and challenges associated with these policies. The stance is not strongly expressed, and the mention of affirmative action is brief and contextual rather than the central theme of the text.	"Summary:
The text provides a narrative journey through Tel Aviv, starting with its historical roots in the ancient port of Jaffa and leading up to its contemporary status as a modern Jewish city. It delves into the city's evolution from a destination for early Zionist immigrants to its current role as a cultural, financial, and party hub of Israel. The story touches on the city's diversity, architecture, and the dichotomy between its modern, liberal lifestyle and the ongoing conflict in other parts of Israel. It also highlights Tel Aviv's celebration of its centennial year, the city's efforts in preserving Bauhaus architecture, and the challenges of gentrification in Arab neighborhoods. The article concludes with a glimpse into the vibrant nightlife of Tel Aviv, which contrasts sharply with the more conservative observance of the Jewish Sabbath in other towns.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is presented through the lens of Tel Aviv's efforts to be an inclusive and tolerant city. The text mentions that Yael Dayan, chairman of the City Council, acknowledges the city's affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs as part of its commitment to welfare, care for the homeless, and tolerance toward minorities. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as an integral part of Tel Aviv's identity as a secular, liberal, and pluralistic city, in line with Theodore Herzl's vision for the Jewish land. However, the perspective is also nuanced, as it recognizes the challenges and criticisms faced by the city, such as the potential gentrification of Arab neighborhoods and the limited success of an Arab mayoral candidate. The author seems to imply that while Tel Aviv strives to be progressive and left-leaning, the reality of affirmative action and minority representation is complex and not without its shortcomings."	0.033280000000000004	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text provides a balanced view of the Christian Coalition's efforts to engage with African-American communities through the Samaritan Project. While the author notes the historical opposition of the Christian Coalition's leadership to affirmative action, they do not express a personal stance on the issue. Instead, they focus on the potential for the Samaritan Project to facilitate racial reconciliation and the cautious optimism that this effort could represent genuine progress. The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred through the context of the Christian Coalition's conservative values rather than through a direct statement of support or opposition. The author seems more concerned with the broader implications of the coalition's actions on racial politics and the role of black churches in these efforts, rather than taking a definitive stance on affirmative action itself.	"The text discusses the potential for the Christian Coalition, under the leadership of Ralph Reed, to bridge the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. The author compares the seemingly unlikely alliance to President Nixon's unexpected opening of relations with China. Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, has historically opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on issues like affirmative action and welfare reform. However, he has also called on white Christian conservatives to acknowledge and make amends for their role in perpetuating slavery and segregation.

The Christian Coalition has launched the Samaritan Project, a multiracial initiative aimed at revitalizing low-income, inner-city neighborhoods. This project includes raising funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by the year 2000, particularly those aiding at-risk youth. The coalition has also planned a conference to create an agenda for cross-racial and cultural cooperation among church leaders.

Reed and Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, have raised significant funds to support black churches, especially in the wake of a series of church burnings. Reed notes the positive reception from African-American leaders and the transformative impact of the project on the Christian Coalition.

The author acknowledges the historical importance of black churches in African-American liberation and self-help initiatives. The Christian Coalition's involvement could bring greater attention and resources to these churches' efforts. However, the author also points out that conservatives may see the Samaritan Project as a means to gain moral authority and political influence, hoping to garner black support for conservative policies like school vouchers, tax credits for charitable donations, and business investment incentives in depressed areas.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that Reed and his organization have been opponents of affirmative action, aligning with their conservative values. The author seems cautiously optimistic about the potential for the Samaritan Project to foster racial reconciliation and is pleased to see conservatives actively seeking black support, which could challenge the racial polarization in national politics.

The author's view is that black church leaders will need to assess whether the Samaritan Project is genuinely beneficial or if it has ulterior motives. Nonetheless, the author expresses a desire for miracles in the realm of racial reconciliation and appears to appreciate the efforts of churches in leading this charge."	0.03361	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action as evidenced by their endorsement of Mayor Daley's plan to diversify the Chicago police force through a combination of written test scores and job performance evaluations. The author acknowledges criticisms but ultimately believes the plan is a positive step towards creating an effective and representative police force. The support for performance-based criteria and the recognition of the need for a police force that reflects the city's demographics indicate a belief in the principles of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Mayor Richard Daley's new strategy to diversify the Chicago police force. The plan involves promoting new sergeants based not only on written test results but also on job performance, aiming to create a force that more closely reflects the city's ethnic and racial makeup. While 70% of promotions will still be based on test scores, 30% will consider job performance, with an emphasis on achieving racial and ethnic balance. This move has been criticized by police union bosses, who argue it could reintroduce political cronyism, and by leaders of the African-American Police League, who feel it implies that special measures are needed for black officers to qualify as sergeants, despite their claims of racial bias in the testing process. The author acknowledges the potential for abuse in the more subjective job performance evaluations but supports the mayor's plan as a step toward a more effective and representative police force, although the plan's survival is uncertain due to possible judicial review.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the concept of affirmative action in the context of promoting a racially and ethnically diverse police force. They applaud Mayor Daley's efforts to adjust the promotion process to better reflect the city's demographics and argue that a diverse police force is necessary for an effective law enforcement body in a diverse city. The author also suggests that performance-based criteria should be a significant factor in promotions, as written tests cannot fully measure an officer's capabilities in real-life situations. While acknowledging the potential for misuse of subjective evaluations, the author believes that the plan, which aims to balance merit with diversity, is a positive step and deserves support. The author distinguishes between affirmative action quotas and the practical need for diversity in the police force, implying that affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully, can be beneficial and necessary."	0.02495	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt	3

They highlight the decrease in black student admissions at UC-Berkeley's law school following the ban on affirmative action, implying that such policies are essential for maintaining racial diversity and addressing inequalities. The use of affirmative action as a tool to combat racial disparities suggests that the authors believe it is necessary for achieving educational equality. Therefore, they appear to be in favor of affirmative action, as they associate its removal with negative consequences for black students.	"Summary:
The text discusses the memorial service for Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, which was attended by a host of prominent figures, contrasting with the sparsely attended funeral of Malcolm X himself in 1965. Shabazz's life is celebrated, noting her achievements and role as a civil rights advocate. The article then transitions into a broader discussion about the state of the black community, integration, and the legacy of Malcolm X. It touches upon the internal debates within the community regarding segregation in schools and the effectiveness of busing. The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, reflect on the complex relationship between separatism and inequality, and how the aftermath of the civil rights era has led to an understanding that inequality fosters separateness. The piece concludes with a mention of the potential effects of a new ban on affirmative action at the University of California, highlighting the dramatic decrease in black students admitted to UC-Berkeley's law school. The summary ends with brief mentions of articles in July Marie Claire about cosmetic breast surgery and July Sports Illustrated For Kids featuring baseball stars' memories of their first gloves.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors appear to view affirmative action as a crucial tool in addressing racial inequalities, especially in education. They imply that the ban on affirmative action at the University of California has led to a significant decrease in black student admissions, suggesting that without such policies, racial disparities in educational opportunities may worsen. The example of only one black student being admitted to the incoming class at UC-Berkeley's law school is used to illustrate the potential negative impact of eliminating affirmative action. The perspective presented seems to be that affirmative action is necessary to combat the historical and ongoing effects of racial discrimination and to promote diversity and equality in educational institutions."	0.02586	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action but does so with a nuanced understanding of the issues surrounding it. While they criticize Graglia's remarks and suggest that minority underachievement is not an unchangeable trait, they also recognize the importance of dialogue and a multifaceted approach to the issue. The author's perspective is not one of unequivocal support or opposition but rather one that acknowledges the complexity of the matter and the need for open discussion and education.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversial remarks made by University of Texas at Austin law Professor Lino Graglia, who stated that Black and Mexican-American students are not academically competitive with white students in selective institutions and attributed this to a cultural lack of encouragement for achievement. His comments sparked outrage among politicians, students, and faculty, leading to calls for his dismissal and debates over academic freedom. The author acknowledges the underperformance of minority students in selective institutions, referencing the work of Thomas Sowell, and points out that socioeconomic factors and historical discrimination may contribute to this issue. The author criticizes Graglia for suggesting that minority underachievement is inevitable and reminds readers of the historical progress of Italian-Americans as a counterexample. The text also comments on the need for open dialogue on race and education, criticizing President Clinton's administration for a lack of nuance on the issue and advocating for tolerance and discussion despite the potential for hurt feelings.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the concept of affirmative action, though with a nuanced view that recognizes both the challenges faced by minorities and the potential for improvement over time. The author believes that Graglia's opposition to affirmative action is valid as a point of view but criticizes Graglia for framing the issue in a way that suggests minority underachievement is a fixed and unchangeable trait, rather than considering the impact of external factors such as socioeconomic status and historical discrimination. The author emphasizes the importance of dialogue and education in addressing complex public policy questions like affirmative action and suggests that a range of perspectives should be considered to foster understanding and progress. The criticism of President Clinton's administration for its lack of nuance on issues of race indicates that the author values a more comprehensive and multifaceted approach to discussions about affirmative action and related topics."	0.02796	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text is critical of affirmative action as it relates to college admissions, particularly the use of racial preferences and the proposal to eliminate standardized testing like the SAT to increase minority enrollment. They believe that the decline in minority enrollment is due to inadequate academic preparation rather than the SAT being unfair. The author argues for improving primary and secondary education for underrepresented groups rather than lowering college standards. This perspective indicates that the author is against the use of affirmative action in its current form, which suggests that they are somewhat against or strongly against it, depending on the intensity of their criticism.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California's approach to addressing the expected drop in Latino enrollment following the elimination of racial preferences in admissions. Instead of improving Hispanic applicants' performance, the task force suggests removing the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), which they score lower on, to increase their eligibility. The author argues against the claims that the SAT is culturally biased, reflects family income, or fails to predict college success. They highlight that Asian-Americans perform better on the SAT than whites and minorities, and that the SAT, combined with high school grades, provides a more comprehensive assessment of a student's potential. The author suggests that grade inflation would worsen if grades became the sole admissions criterion. They emphasize the need for better primary and secondary education for black and Hispanic students, rather than lowering college standards, to prepare them for the rigors of college and argue that the SAT should not be blamed for highlighting educational disparities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. They view the decline in the number of blacks and Latinos at the University of California as a consequence of poor academic preparation, not the unfairness of the SAT. The author believes that affirmative action policies that admit students to colleges that are too demanding for their current capabilities lead to high dropout rates among these students. They argue that instead of lowering academic standards or removing standardized tests like the SAT, efforts should be focused on improving the quality of education in grade schools and high schools for black and Hispanic students. The author suggests that affirmative action in its current form may be counterproductive and that educational reform at the primary and secondary levels is necessary to truly help underrepresented students succeed in college."	0.028990000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary tool to correct historical injustices and enhance diversity in the workforce. They emphasize the importance of increased access to job training for black women and suggest that businesses should not restrict but rather expand these opportunities. The advocacy for lifelong learning, mentoring, and on-the-job training as ways to ensure equal access to career advancement opportunities further underscores their positive stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses a study titled ""Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991,"" which investigated the participation of black and white women in job training programs over two decades. The study found that while the participation of both groups doubled, white women were more likely to be involved in managerial and professional training. In the 1970s, black women were disproportionately represented in clerical and semiskilled programs, and although this segregation diminished in the 1980s, the overall participation of black women in job training programs declined. The study also found that job training led to higher wages, regardless of the program's duration or the participant's educational level and work history.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors view affirmative action positively, seeing it as a means to address historical injustices and improve diversity in the workforce. They believe that increased access to job training for black working women is essential and suggest that businesses should expand these opportunities rather than restrict access for some groups. By doing so, companies can benefit from a more qualified and diverse workforce, and employees can enjoy tangible rewards such as higher wages. The authors advocate for lifelong learning and continuous skill acquisition, emphasizing the need for proactive efforts by black women to ensure access to training programs that align with their aspirations and abilities. They also call for the mentoring of younger women to prepare them for the future workplace and encourage businesses to invest in on-the-job training as a way to adapt to changing job requirements and avoid wasting talent. Overall, the authors support affirmative action as a strategy for promoting equality and maximizing human capital within organizations."	0.02828	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is portrayed as supportive, as evidenced by the positive depiction of Mayor Daley's efforts to use affirmative action to promote diversity within the police and fire departments. The author's support is further highlighted by the criticism of the police and fire unions' resistance to affirmative action and the call for black and Hispanic members to exert more influence within their unions. The author's comparison of Daley to 'a latter-day Lincoln' suggests a strong endorsement of affirmative action as a tool to correct historical injustices and improve minority representation in public services.	"Summary:
The text discusses Mayor Richard Daley's efforts to integrate Chicago's police and fire departments with more black and Hispanic officers through affirmative action. The police and fire unions have been resistant to these efforts, with the Fraternal Order of Police running radio ads against the use of affirmative action in police promotions, and the Chicago Fire Fighters Union reluctantly agreeing to consider job performance for promotions after lengthy contract negotiations. Despite resistance from the unions, the Daley administration is pushing for a police and fire service that better reflects the city's racial and ethnic diversity. The author also calls for black and Hispanic police and firefighters to become more organized and proactive in exerting power within their unions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, particularly in the context of promoting racial and ethnic diversity within the police and fire departments. The author portrays Mayor Daley's use of affirmative action as a positive step towards correcting historical injustices and creating opportunities for minorities. The unions' opposition to these measures is depicted as self-serving and obstructive to progress. The author suggests that affirmative action is necessary to overcome the entrenched biases and practices that have kept minority representation low in these departments. Despite acknowledging that Daley's commitment may be politically motivated, the author views his actions favorably when compared to the unions, even likening Daley to ""a latter-day Lincoln"" for his efforts in this regard."	0.02194	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion of the historic decision to pay reparations to African-American farmers indicates a nuanced view on the issue of affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly state a position for or against affirmative action, the text suggests that the author sees reparations as a preferable alternative. The author's skepticism towards affirmative action is inferred from the statement that reparations offer a 'welcome respite' from the debates on preference policies. Additionally, the author's endorsement of reparations, which are described as justified by economic and moral considerations and as a more direct response to systemic racial injustices, suggests a belief in addressing historical wrongs through specific, targeted measures rather than through broader affirmative action policies. However, without a clear statement of opposition to affirmative action, it is most accurate to categorize the author as 'somewhat against' rather than 'strongly against' affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the historic decision of the federal government to pay reparations to African-American farmers, marking the first time since Reconstruction that the government has compensated African-Americans for past racism. This decision came as a result of a federal judge approving a settlement in a 1997 class-action lawsuit, which accused the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) of racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies. The settlement includes a minimum payment of $50,000 in cash and debt relief to each affected black farmer, as well as the return of foreclosed lands. The decline of African-American farmers from 14 percent in 1920 to less than 1 percent today is attributed to the USDA's discriminatory practices. The total claims are expected to exceed $375 million, although some farmers believe the settlement is insufficient. The lawsuit and the settlement are seen as a basis for broader claims of reparations for African-Americans due to centuries of slavery and discrimination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action and other preference policies with some skepticism, noting that reparations offer a ""welcome respite"" from the acrimonious debates surrounding these issues. The author suggests that reparations, unlike affirmative action, would distribute the cost evenly through the tax system and are justified by both economic and moral considerations. The text implies that reparations are a more direct and historically grounded response to systemic racial injustices than affirmative action policies, which can be divisive and contentious. The author also draws parallels between the reparations paid to African-Americans and those paid by Germany to Jewish victims of the Nazi era, emphasizing a sense of moral responsibility to redress historical wrongs."	0.03024	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author is critical of the union's opposition to affirmative action and their attempts to eliminate merit promotions that benefit minority firefighters. The author also finds the union's mockery of cultural events for black citizens to be inflammatory. They advocate for reforms to support diversity and confront racism, indicating a clear support for affirmative action principles. The author's perspective is characterized by a disapproval of the union's actions, which are perceived as racist, and a call for the Mayor to implement affirmative action policies to ensure diversity within the fire department.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Chicago Fire Fighters Union's initial contract offer, which is seen as a reflection of the racism and pettiness within the union, particularly since the 1980 strike. William Kugelman, a leader during the strike and an opponent of affirmative action, was recently elected union president. A key issue in the contract negotiations is the department's use of performance in addition to test scores and longevity for promotions to create a command structure that reflects the city's diversity. The union's proposal includes a significant pay raise request and changes to work rules, but what is most concerning is the attempt to eliminate ""merit"" promotions that have benefited black and Hispanic firefighters. The union also facetiously suggests adding Arbor Day and Bud Billiken Day, a day celebrating black youth, as paid holidays, which the author finds particularly inflammatory. The author urges Mayor Daley to implement reforms to end racist practices in the fire department and confront the ""Brotherhood of the Barrel.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of the union's stance against affirmative action, particularly under the leadership of William Kugelman, who is characterized as an outspoken opponent of such measures. The author views the union's contract proposal as an attempt to reverse the progress made in promoting diversity within the fire department. The use of ""merit"" promotions is seen as a way to allow for the advancement of minority firefighters, which the union is trying to eliminate. This, combined with the mockery of a significant cultural event for black Chicagoans, suggests that the author believes affirmative action is necessary to combat entrenched racism and to ensure that the fire service's command structure accurately represents the diverse community it serves. The author advocates for Mayor Daley to push for reforms that support affirmative action and diversity, showing a clear support for these principles."	0.023960000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt	3
	None	The author mentions affirmative action in the context of the questionnaire topics but does not provide a personal perspective on the policy. The text is focused on the utility of certain websites in matching voters' political views with presidential candidates and does not delve into the author's stance on affirmative action or any specific policy issue. Therefore, there is insufficient information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the utility of the Internet in the context of the presidential election, highlighting websites that help voters match their political views with those of the candidates. The author describes using selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com, which offer questionnaires on various national issues and then suggest which candidates align most closely with the user's views. The author shares personal results, which favored Libertarian candidate Harry Browne, and expresses skepticism about some candidates, like Pat Buchanan, due to personal disagreements that the quizzes don't account for. The author notes that while these websites are helpful in focusing on policy issues, they have limitations, such as neglecting certain topics, experience, and temperament. Despite these shortcomings, the author sees value in the exercise as it encourages voters to consider their policy preferences and find candidates that align with their desired direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action in the context of the questionnaire topics but does not explicitly reveal their personal perspective on the policy. The focus is more on how such questionnaires can help voters understand where they stand on various issues, including affirmative action, in relation to the presidential candidates. The author's main concern seems to be the overall alignment of their views with those of the candidates, rather than any single issue. Without additional context, it's not possible to determine the author's perspective on affirmative action from the text provided."	0.02556	affirmative action	txt/419118450.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's recounting of Clarence Thomas' speech and their admiration for his courage to stand by his convictions, particularly on race and affirmative action, suggests a perspective aligned with Thomas' critical view of affirmative action. The author's emphasis on the need for honest debate and the portrayal of Thomas' journey as a testament to bravery and resilience indicate a viewpoint that questions the current affirmative action policies and supports a merit-based system. The author's positive framing of Thomas' challenging the status quo implies a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action, as they are advocating for open discussion and reevaluation of such policies.	"Summary:
The author recounts their experience of reading a New York Times column by Maureen Dowd about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at an American Enterprise Institute dinner. While Dowd described the speech as negative, the author perceived it as inspiring. They note the attentive and appreciative audience, despite Dowd's critical view. The author emphasizes that Thomas discussed the importance of standing by one's principles and convictions, particularly regarding his views on race and affirmative action. Thomas pointed out the lack of honest debate on racial issues and the backlash faced by those who question the status quo. The author admires Thomas for his courage to speak out despite expecting personal attacks and highlights his journey from Pin Point, Georgia, to the Supreme Court as a testament to his bravery and resilience.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a perspective that is sympathetic to Clarence Thomas' views on affirmative action. They suggest that Thomas, as a black man, has faced criticism for daring to question policies such as affirmative action, school busing, and welfare, which are often associated with the advancement of black Americans. The author implies that Thomas believes in a more merit-based system and that questioning such policies should not be seen as treason but as part of an honest debate. The author's tone indicates a belief that open discussion about affirmative action is necessary and that it takes courage to challenge widely accepted views on the topic. They seem to support Thomas' stance that advocating for one's principles, even when they go against the conventional wisdom on racial issues, is a form of bravery."	0.02589	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their emphasis on the importance of diversity in educational environments and the idea that diversity is a compelling interest that justifies race-conscious admissions policies. They challenge the idea that merit is solely based on test scores and grades, suggesting a broader definition of merit that includes diverse experiences and backgrounds. The author also cites evidence supporting the performance of minority students admitted through affirmative action and underscores the value of direct encounters with diverse individuals in education. These points indicate a stance that is more than just a passive approval of affirmative action but a reasoned argument in its favor.	"Summary:
The article discusses the heightened awareness of diversity in America following the events of September 11, 2001. It highlights that this increased consciousness about diversity is particularly noticeable on college campuses, where there is a surge in interest in subjects related to the Middle East and international relations. The article also delves into the ongoing debate over affirmative action and the use of race-conscious admissions policies to foster diversity in higher education. It outlines conflicting court decisions on this matter and suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court may eventually need to resolve these differences. The author argues that while remedying past racial discrimination is challenging to prove, promoting diversity as an educational goal is beneficial for all students. The article also considers the implications of a race-blind policy on minority admissions and includes a statement from University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor on the importance of diverse perspectives in higher education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the idea of affirmative action in college admissions, emphasizing the importance of a diverse educational environment. They argue that diversity is a compelling interest that justifies considering race and ethnicity in admissions policies. The author challenges the notion that merit should be judged solely by test scores and grades, suggesting that merit takes many forms and that context matters in evaluating student achievements. They also cite evidence that minority students admitted through affirmative action programs may perform better at top schools than their peers at less selective institutions. The author underscores the value of direct encounters with diverse individuals as irreplaceable for challenging the heart and mind, indicating a belief that a diverse student body is essential for a stimulating educational experience."	0.02843	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's text does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action as a policy, but it does express strong disapproval of the misuse and manipulation of affirmative action programs. The author's primary concern is with the corruption and fraudulent activities conducted by the Duffs and the lack of media scrutiny and accountability in such cases. The text criticizes those who exploit systems intended to benefit underrepresented groups, but it does not provide a clear position on the policy itself, suggesting that the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central point of the discussion.	"Summary:
The text discusses a scandal involving the Duffs, a family with links to the Chicago Outfit, who are about to be indicted for a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud. The author, who is a columnist, has been critical of the Mayor of Chicago and his friends, including the Duffs, for taking advantage of taxpayer dollars through government contracts. The Duffs, who are white, were accused of running fake companies to secure city contracts intended for minority or women-owned businesses. The author reflects on the differences in media scrutiny between the current mayor, who is white, and the late Mayor Harold Washington, who was black, when faced with corruption allegations. The author also appreciates the work of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, as the indictments against the Duffs are announced.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action as a policy. However, the text criticizes the exploitation of affirmative action programs by the Duffs, who fraudulently claimed city contracts meant for minority or women-owned businesses. The author's focus is on the corruption and misuse of affirmative action for personal gain, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of the policy itself. The author is appalled by the manipulation of a system designed to help disadvantaged groups and emphasizes the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions, particularly when they involve the misuse of taxpayer money."	0.027790000000000002	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to acknowledge the necessity and goals of affirmative action, particularly in promoting fairness and addressing past discrimination within the Chicago Fire Department. Despite recognizing that affirmative action policies have led to resentment among some white firefighters, the author condemns the racist behavior and bigotry displayed as a response to these policies. The call for the department to move past its history of racism and to ensure that firefighters respect the diverse public they serve indicates a belief in the principles behind affirmative action, even if the author is aware of the discord it has caused. The author's condemnation of racism and support for the goals of affirmative action, without an explicit endorsement of the policy itself, suggests a nuanced view that leans toward favoring affirmative action but with an understanding of its complexities.	"Summary:
The text discusses incidents of racism within the Chicago Fire Department, where racist slurs have been broadcast over department radio frequencies. The author highlights past tensions since the department's integration in 1968 and references a 1997 videotape showing firefighters engaging in racist behavior. The text mentions James McNally, a firefighter who protested affirmative action by appearing in blackface, and who is now the president of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2. Fire Commissioner James Joyce and Mayor Richard Daley have both stated that such behavior could lead to dismissal. The department has faced challenges in disciplining those involved, with some previously fired firefighters winning their jobs back. The author calls for the department to move past its history of racism and for firefighters to lead the way in restoring integrity, suggesting that those who cannot respect the diverse public they serve should find another line of work.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive but acknowledges the complexity and controversy it brings within the department. The author understands that affirmative action aims to promote fairness by accelerating the promotion of minorities, which was long overdue. However, the author also recognizes that this has caused resentment among some white firefighters who feel they are being treated unfairly due to these policies. Despite this, the author condemns the expression of frustration through ""the most vicious bigotry imaginable"" and does not find it acceptable for firefighters to harbor such resentment. The text suggests that while the goal of affirmative action is fairness, it must be balanced with the need to maintain harmony and respect within the department and the community it serves."	0.031049999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as indicated by the critical tone when discussing the misuse of affirmative action contracts by the Duffs and the implication that political motivations may underlie the appointment of Cortez Trotter, rather than a genuine commitment to diversity. The skepticism towards the effectiveness and integrity of affirmative action initiatives, along with the mention of opposition from the union to racial preferences, further supports this categorization.	"Summary:
The text discusses the appointment of Cortez Trotter, a black man, as the new Fire Commissioner of Chicago's predominantly white Fire Department, replacing the outgoing white commissioner, James Joyce. Mayor Richard Daley insists that Trotter's appointment is based on qualifications, not politics or symbolism. Trotter, who has a background as a paramedic and bureaucrat rather than a firefighter, emphasizes the importance of diversity and warns against any discriminatory behavior within the department. The text suggests that Daley's decision is politically motivated to protect his own interests, especially in light of an upcoming trial involving white individuals fraudulently receiving affirmative action contracts. Trotter faces the challenge of earning the respect of firefighters and managing the department's diversity issues, all while navigating the political landscape.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of affirmative action, particularly in the context of the alleged misuse of affirmative action contracts by the Outfit-connected Duffs, who are white. The author implies that these contracts, intended for minority-owned firms, were fraudulently obtained, suggesting a corruption of the affirmative action system. Furthermore, the author hints at skepticism regarding the genuine commitment to diversity within the Fire Department, suggesting that Trotter's promotion may be more about the mayor's political image than actual progress in affirmative action. Trotter's push for affirmative action policies is framed as a necessary response to a union that opposes racial preferences, indicating a contentious environment around the issue. Overall, the author seems to question the effectiveness and integrity of affirmative action initiatives within the political context of Chicago."	0.026750000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical commentary on the exploitation of affirmative action policies by the Duff family, who are white, indicates a stance against the misuse and manipulation of these policies. The author's skepticism about the integrity of the system and the sarcastic tone when referring to the Duffs' exploitation of affirmative action suggest that the author believes in the intended purpose of affirmative action but is against its improper application and the lack of oversight that allows such exploitation. The text does not necessarily argue against the principles of affirmative action itself but rather highlights a case of its abuse, implying that the author is likely in favor of affirmative action when implemented correctly.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, a former purchasing agent for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, and his apparent lack of knowledge or opinion on a controversial affirmative action contract issue. The author highlights the case where the Duff family, who are white and allegedly have connections to organized crime, received $100 million in contracts intended for minorities. The author expresses skepticism about the lack of media coverage, particularly on television, due to the lack of exciting visuals. The author also notes Grzyb's evasion of questions and his previous involvement in deals that benefited Daley's cronies, despite lacking proper credentials. The text ends with a sarcastic commentary on the American dream and the Duff family's exploitation of affirmative action policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical, especially when it is exploited by individuals who do not belong to the minority groups it is intended to support. The author sarcastically questions the fairness and integrity of the system, suggesting that it is absurd for the white Duff family to claim minority status for financial gain. The tone suggests that the author views the situation as a perversion of the affirmative action policy, which is meant to provide opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, not for well-connected white individuals who can manipulate the system. The author's use of irony in discussing the ""miracle"" of the Duffs obtaining these contracts implies a deep cynicism about the implementation and oversight of affirmative action within Chicago's City Hall."	0.02895	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, Clarence Page, presents a perspective that acknowledges the value of individual merit and making oneself indispensable, as illustrated by the story of John H. Johnson and his hiring of Matthew Henson. While not explicitly denouncing affirmative action, the emphasis on individual effort and success based on personal abilities suggests that the author leans towards the importance of personal merit over institutionalized assistance. The author's perspective appears to be that affirmative action may have a place, but it is not the primary factor for success; rather, individual effort is key.	"Summary:
John H. Johnson, the influential black publisher of Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, passed away at the age of 87. His publications were crucial for representing a positive image of black America and proving the economic significance of the black consumer market. Johnson's success story is a testament to his business acumen and resilience, overcoming obstacles like limited educational opportunities and breaking into a market that had underestimated the black audience. His autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" illustrates his problem-solving skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Johnson's advice, ""Make yourself indispensable,"" reflects his approach to business and life. He emphasized the importance of offering value, service, and quality to succeed in a free market, regardless of racial loyalty. His hiring of Matthew Henson, the black explorer who played a key role in reaching the North Pole, exemplifies this philosophy, as Henson was chosen for his skills, not out of charity or affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clarence Page, seems to acknowledge the value of affirmative action but also emphasizes the importance of individual merit and indispensability. By highlighting Johnson's story about Matthew Henson, who was hired for his unique skills and not through an affirmative action plan, Page suggests that true success comes from making oneself indispensable through one's own efforts and abilities. Johnson's own rise to success, despite the lack of affirmative action during his time, further underscores the author's perspective that while affirmative action can play a role in providing opportunities, it is ultimately the individual's responsibility to become indispensable and excel based on their own merits."	0.02792	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary. The summary indicates that affirmative action is mentioned as one of the issues debated by the presidential candidates, but it does not provide any information on the author's personal views or analysis of the policy itself. Instead, the summary focuses on the election dynamics, candidates' debate performances, and their political strategies. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not addressed in the summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the state of the 2004 presidential race, framing it as a contest between those who love President George W. Bush and those who hate him, with a focus on their reactions to his policies and leadership style. John Kerry, the challenger, has not garnered the same level of clear support, and his agenda remains less defined. The debates have highlighted Kerry's strengths as a debater and his ability to point out the flaws in Bush's record, which may influence voters who are motivated by opposition to the incumbent. The debates have drawn sharp distinctions between the candidates on key issues such as abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, and the role of government in healthcare and education. Bush has been on the defensive, particularly on economic issues, while Kerry has played to themes of class warfare. Both candidates attempted to use catchy lines in the debates, but with limited success. Personal connection with voters is also discussed as an important factor in the election, with Bush showing more personal warmth. The final debate is seen as the last major national event before the election, with subsequent campaigning being more focused and localized. Historical precedents suggest that incumbents who do not perform well in debates often do not fare well in the election.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action but does mention it as one of the controversial domestic issues debated by Bush and Kerry. The article indicates that the debate served to outline the distinct differences between the two candidates' positions on affirmative action, along with other social and economic issues, suggesting that voters have a clear choice between the candidates' policies. The author's focus is on the political implications and the candidates' strategies rather than on a personal stance on affirmative action."	0.03258	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author's description of the satirical events planned by students to mock political correctness and affirmative action, as well as the reference to the 'purported silliness' of race-based distinctions, indicates a critical view of affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly state a personal stance, the language used and the focus on the potential for reverse discrimination suggest that the author may be somewhat against affirmative action, at least in the form it is currently practiced in academic settings.	"Summary:
The text discusses the satirical activities being planned by some students at Columbia College Chicago to mock the concept of political correctness on college campuses. These activities include an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" where students would be charged different prices based on their race, and a game called ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant,"" where participants chase a student pretending to be an undocumented immigrant. The author notes that such stunts are not unique to Columbia and have occurred at various elite universities. The text also references the incident involving Don Imus, a radio personality who made offensive comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team, to illustrate the potential harm that such jokes can cause. The author suggests that instead of reacting with outrage and forming committees to address these stunts, it might be more effective to simply ignore them, as the Rutgers team did with Imus.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, particularly of the way it is implemented and perceived in academic environments. The proposed ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale"" is described as a means to confront the college community with what the author implies is the ""purported silliness"" of making race-based distinctions, both favorable and unfavorable. The author's use of language suggests a view that affirmative action, as it is practiced in academia, may lead to reverse discrimination or be seen as an overcorrection that itself merits satire. The author does not explicitly state their own stance on affirmative action but highlights the actions of students who appear to question its logic and application in a university setting."	0.02319	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, Charles Krauthammer, does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. He mentions Barack Obama's comments on affirmative action in the context of the value of extended campaigns for facilitating significant debates and shifts in political ideology. However, Krauthammer's personal view on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and the summary does not provide enough information to categorize his stance.	"Summary:
In the text, Charles Krauthammer discusses the prolonged nature of American presidential campaigns compared to those in Britain, Canada, and other countries. He identifies three functions of the extended campaign process: testing managerial skills, building party consensus and democratic legitimacy, and satisfying the American instinct for egalitarianism by subjecting candidates to physically exhausting and spiritually humbling experiences. Krauthammer notes that while the campaign's length can test patience and seems filled with trivialities, it occasionally provokes significant debates and shifts in political ideology, citing examples such as Barack Obama's comments on affirmative action and Rudy Giuliani's stance on abortion. He also references Bill Clinton's campaign pledge on welfare reform as an example of a campaign promise leading to significant policy change. Despite the grueling nature of campaigns, Krauthammer concludes that they serve critical purposes and fulfill Americans' desire to see their leaders demonstrate humility and commonality with the electorate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Krauthammer touches on affirmative action by mentioning Barack Obama's suggestion to move away from race-based preferences to class-based preferences. While Krauthammer does not explicitly state his own perspective on affirmative action in this text, he seems to acknowledge the value of the extended campaign process in potentially facilitating a historic debate within the Democratic Party on the topic. This indicates that he views the campaign as a platform for important policy discussions and possible shifts in the national consensus on issues like affirmative action. The text suggests that Krauthammer sees affirmative action as a topic worthy of re-examination and debate, possibly leading to a new approach to addressing inequality."	0.02677	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author acknowledges the presence of affirmative action in Lewis Hamilton's career but minimizes its significance, emphasizing Hamilton's talent, dedication, and the support from McLaren as the primary reasons for his success. The mention of affirmative action is brief and is not presented as a major contributing factor to Hamilton's rise in F1 racing.	"Summary:
The text discusses Lewis Hamilton's exceptional start as a rookie in Formula One (F1) racing. At 22 years old, he has achieved remarkable success, with a third-place finish in Australia and a second-place in Malaysia, raising expectations for a possible win in Bahrain. Hamilton is compared to legendary drivers and is noted for his skillful driving, particularly in holding off competitors to support his teammate Fernando Alonso. Hamilton's rise to F1 is attributed to his talent and a developmental contract with McLaren at a young age, with only a slight mention of affirmative action contributing to his opportunity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action in the context of Lewis Hamilton's career is that it played a minimal role. The text states that there is ""but a touch of affirmative action"" in Hamilton's story, implying that while it may have been a factor, it was not the primary reason for his success. Instead, the author emphasizes Hamilton's own talent, dedication, and the early support from McLaren and Mercedes-Benz as the key elements that propelled him into F1 racing. The mention of affirmative action seems to acknowledge that there might have been some measures to promote diversity in the sport, but in Hamilton's case, the focus is on his personal merit and achievements."	0.02382	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt	3
	None	The text provided does not contain a clear discussion or perspective on affirmative action. The summary focuses on President Barack Obama's reaction to the AIG bonus scandal and political strategies related to it. There is a brief mention of Mayor Richard Daley's affirmative action contracts, but it is used as an example of political hypocrisy rather than a direct commentary on affirmative action itself. As such, there is not enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action, and the author's perspective on the topic is not the central concern of the text.	"Summary:
The author criticizes President Barack Obama for a gaffe he made on ""The Tonight Show,"" but argues that a more significant issue was Obama's reaction to the AIG bonus scandal. Obama expressed surprise at the $165 million in bonuses given to AIG executives, although it was revealed that his Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, was aware of the bonuses weeks before the public outcry. The author likens the situation to Chicago politics, where backroom deals and feigned ignorance are common. The text suggests that the Democrats' outrage over the AIG bonuses is a political strategy to cover themselves for the upcoming 2010 elections and maintain their narrative of fighting against ""The Evil Rich Guy."" The author also points out that a New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, questioned Geithner about the bonuses well before they became a public issue, indicating that the administration was well-informed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and sarcastic, as seen in the passage discussing Mayor Richard Daley's affirmative action contracts. The author describes a situation where Daley, apparently stunned, later found out that $100 million in affirmative action contracts went to white men instead of black women. This anecdote is used to illustrate the author's view of political hypocrisy and manipulation surrounding affirmative action, suggesting that it's used as a façade for personal gain rather than genuine social progress. The tone implies that the author is skeptical of the sincerity and effectiveness of affirmative action policies as practiced by certain politicians."	0.028909999999999998	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as evidenced by the positive portrayal of the IMPACT program and the recognition of the need for such initiatives to address the lack of diversity on boards. The author acknowledges the challenges and complexities of affirmative action but also emphasizes its importance in promoting qualified minority candidates to positions of influence. The reference to participants' views that candidates were peers and not just diversity quotas further suggests a nuanced endorsement of affirmative action as a means of ensuring equal opportunity and representation.	"Summary:
Phyllis Lockett is a highly qualified African-American woman with an impressive background in business and civic engagement. Executive recruiter Charles Tribbett III, recognizing the need for greater diversity on the boards of Chicago's largest cultural institutions, approached her to join one such board. This move is part of a broader initiative, called IMPACT, which over three years spent about $400,000 to place nine qualified minority candidates on these boards. The program, funded by the Joyce Foundation, Boeing Co., and The Chicago Community Trust, aimed to expand the diversity of board membership, which has traditionally been lacking. Despite the challenges of finding diverse candidates and the necessity of meeting annual giving requirements, the program succeeded in placing all remaining candidates onto six boards after more than half of the institutions initially declined to participate. The author, Melissa Harris, notes the difficulty of achieving diversity without special programs and expresses a desire for a world where such initiatives are not needed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, as it relates to board diversity in nonprofit organizations, seems to be pragmatic and acknowledges the challenges involved in diversifying boards. The author recognizes the value of affirmative action as a means to address the ""abysmal"" lack of diversity in board membership across Chicago's cultural institutions. The IMPACT program, which the author describes, can be seen as a form of affirmative action, actively seeking to place qualified minority candidates in positions that have been historically dominated by white males.

The use of the term ""affirmative action"" by one of the participants, Lyndon Taylor, is notable. Taylor, who joined the board of Hubbard Street Dance through the IMPACT program, insists that ""everyone we placed was a peer,"" indicating that the candidates were selected based on their qualifications and not solely their minority status. This suggests that the author, through the voices included in the article, views affirmative action not as a lowering of standards but as a proactive effort to include highly qualified individuals from diverse backgrounds who may otherwise be overlooked due to systemic biases.

The author also touches on the complexities of affirmative action, such as the potential for minorities to be perceived as tokens if fundraising responsibilities are not taken seriously. This complexity is acknowledged by Charles Katzenmeyer from the Adler Planetarium, who suggests that the effort put into the recruitment process by firms like Russell Reynolds Associates is meant to ensure that the candidates are not just fulfilling a diversity quota but are genuinely contributing members of the board.

In summary, the author presents affirmative action as a necessary and strategic approach to creating more inclusive and representative boards within Chicago's nonprofit sector, while also recognizing the need for a nuanced understanding of its implementation and effects."	0.036430000000000004	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text does not directly express their own stance on affirmative action. Instead, they focus on the misinterpretation of Martin Luther King Jr.'s views on the subject, criticizing the 'dangerous ideological revisionism' that occurs when historical figures' words are co-opted for modern political debates. The author emphasizes the complexity of King's positions and cautions against simplifying them for contemporary agendas. The text suggests that King's approach to racial justice was multifaceted and cannot be easily categorized. Since the author's primary concern is the accurate historical representation of King's views rather than advocating for or against affirmative action, there is not enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing that while his famous ""I have a dream"" speech is iconic, it has also contributed to a perception of him as an unrealistic idealist. The author argues that King was more than just a dreamer; he was a problem solver, as evidenced in his lesser-known work ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"". The author cautions against misappropriating King's words for contemporary political debates, as was done during the Proposition 209 debate in California, and acknowledges the complexity and contradictions in King's positions and personal life. The text outlines King's multifaceted approach to issues such as the black family crisis, educational neglect, political apathy, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare. Despite some of his proposals being seen as outdated or having been tried and discarded, the author maintains that King's vision remains more compelling than many current leaders' efforts.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that during the debate over Proposition 209 in California, both sides misused Martin Luther King Jr.'s sporadic comments on affirmative action, which was a nascent concept in the 1960s. This misuse is described as ""dangerous ideological revisionism"" and is criticized by the author. The text suggests that King's views on affirmative action and related topics cannot be easily categorized or used to support a particular contemporary political stance. Instead, King is portrayed as having a nuanced approach to racial and class issues, which included advocating for government-funded programs and personal responsibility, as well as corporate and individual initiatives to empower the black community. The author does not directly state their own perspective on affirmative action but seems to advocate for a balanced and historically accurate understanding of King's views on the matter."	0.032159999999999994	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action. While the author acknowledges affirmative action as a recurring social issue and notes that beneficiaries have been targeted in political campaigns, there is no explicit endorsement or condemnation of affirmative action policies themselves. The author's focus is on the cyclical and politicized nature of issues in California, rather than taking a clear stance on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is contextualized within a broader discussion of California's political history and the exploitation of social issues for political gain, rather than as a standalone topic of advocacy or criticism.	"Summary:
The text provides a reflective commentary on the repetitive nature of California's social, political, and environmental issues. The author describes California as a land of constant change, yet paradoxically, certain issues recur with predictable regularity. Water scarcity is a perennial problem, with disputes over the allocation of resources like the Colorado River water being a recurring theme. Politically, the state has a history of campaigns targeting various groups, from Chinese laborers in the 1800s to affirmative action beneficiaries in more recent times. The author predicts that the future will bring more of the same: water wars, social wedge issues, and celebrities remaining in the public eye.

The author also expresses a degree of frustration with the cyclical nature of news, which can lead to cynicism among journalists. Despite the sense of déjà vu, new controversies do arise, such as debates over gambling and the regulation of card rooms and casinos. The author suggests that as long as there is money involved, politicians will continue to engage in endless debates without seeking resolutions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as one of many social issues that have been politicized in California's history. It is mentioned alongside other groups that have been targeted or scapegoated in political campaigns, which implies a recognition of the divisive nature of the topic. The reference to affirmative action beneficiaries being targeted suggests that the author may see this as a political tactic used to garner votes rather than a genuine attempt to address inequality. The tone implies a critical view of the way affirmative action and other social issues are treated in the political arena, seen as part of a cycle of wedge issues that are exploited for political gain rather than being resolved."	0.02935	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not clearly stated in the text. The discussion of affirmative action is limited to its mention as a part of a conservative narrative. The author does not express a personal stance on the policy but instead focuses on the broader context of American optimism and its impact on political discourse. Because the author's own views on affirmative action are not articulated, there is insufficient information to categorize their stance on the issue.	"Summary:
The text is an op-ed piece that reflects on the resurgence of American optimism in the late 1990s after a prolonged period of pessimism about the country's direction. The author notes that despite Americans traditionally being optimistic about their personal lives, their outlook on the nation's future had been grim since the early 1970s. This trend, however, has reversed, with consumer confidence reaching a 28-year high, President Clinton enjoying strong approval ratings, and a majority of Americans now believing the country is on the right track. The author attributes this renewed optimism to a robust economy, reduced unemployment, shrinking federal budget deficit, declining crime rates, and stabilization in divorce and out-of-wedlock birth rates. Additionally, the author points out that America has regained its self-perception as a leader in shaping the future, with influential centers like Seattle, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley driving technological and cultural advances.

The author also discusses how this optimism affects the political landscape, suggesting that it makes it harder for politicians to mobilize the public around ideologically driven agendas. The text argues that in times of optimism, voters prefer incremental changes and convergence over polarization. The author warns, however, that this positive mood could lead to complacency and that there are still significant challenges to address, such as education, low wages, and urban poverty. The author calls for leaders to invest in long-term prosperity and to avoid the pitfalls of complacency, using the post-World War II era as an example of how prosperity can be leveraged to create a stronger, more inclusive society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly touches on affirmative action when discussing the political narratives that have been used to explain American anxiety. Conservatives are said to have blamed various factors for societal problems, including big government, welfare, affirmative action, immigrants, and cultural changes. The author does not explicitly state their own perspective on affirmative action but implies that in the current climate of optimism, such issues are losing their potency as sources of public agitation. The focus is more on the shift in public mood and the political implications of this shift rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.03467	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author presents a perspective that views affirmative action as a necessary tool to address racial inequality and discrimination in the United States. They advocate for stronger enforcement of civil rights laws and support increased funding for these efforts, as proposed by the Clinton administration. The author's reference to Justice Ginsburg's dissent underlines the ongoing reality of discrimination and the need for affirmative action policies to combat it. The criticism of those who oppose affirmative action while also rejecting the enforcement of equality laws indicates that the author believes affirmative action is essential for achieving true equality and providing equal opportunities.	"Summary:
The text addresses the issue of racial inequality in the United States and the need for stricter enforcement of civil rights laws to ensure equal opportunities for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. The author supports the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights funding by 17%, which would aid in reducing the backlog of cases at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and strengthen the enforcement of housing, employment, and education laws. The author highlights the persistence of racial barriers, as eloquently described by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and points out the contradiction in the stance of affirmative action opponents who reject tougher enforcement of equality laws. The Clinton administration's plan includes increasing funding for various departments and employing ""testers"" to reveal discriminatory practices in housing. The author argues that while dialogue on race is important, concrete actions, such as timely enforcement of civil rights laws, are critical to achieving true equality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a necessary measure to combat ongoing racial inequality and discrimination in American society. They reference Justice Ginsburg's dissent to emphasize the reality of discrimination in the workplace, housing, and consumer markets. The author seems to support affirmative action policies as part of a broader strategy to enforce civil rights and provide equal opportunities to all individuals. Moreover, the author questions the logic of those who oppose affirmative action yet also stand against the enforcement of existing laws that promote equality, suggesting that the author believes in affirmative action as a means to level the playing field and ensure fair treatment for historically marginalized groups."	0.02297	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is solely to characterize a political figure's position within the context of a gubernatorial race. Since the author's perspective on affirmative action is not discussed or implied beyond its relevance to the political landscape, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance on the issue.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the importance of having a ""fire in the belly"" in both sports and politics, emphasizing the value of eagerness and determination over mere talent or strength. The context is the California gubernatorial race, where three potential candidates with considerable promise chose not to run, leaving four others who demonstrated the necessary drive and ambition. The author briefly discusses the merits and drawbacks of each candidate, including Republican Dan Lungren and Democrats Gray Davis, Al Checchi, and Jane Harman. The text also touches on the decisions of Dianne Feinstein, Leon Panetta, and Richard Riordan not to enter the race, analyzing their reasons and the potential impact of their candidacies. The author concludes by urging people to focus on the candidates who are running and to make a choice, rather than lamenting those who opted out.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the primary focus of the text, but it is mentioned in a political context. The author notes that L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, who decided not to run for governor, did not support anti-affirmative action initiatives. This is used to illustrate Riordan's political positioning and how it might have made him a less appealing candidate to traditional Republican voters, as well as a potential target for his opponent Dan Lungren. The author does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action; rather, the mention of it serves to characterize Riordan's political profile within the narrative of the gubernatorial race."	0.02704	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, Herschel Rosenthal, does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action, but he expresses concern over the quality of debate surrounding sensitive issues like affirmative action. He believes that the decline in personal relationships among legislators has led to debates that lack sensitivity and understanding. While he does not directly endorse or oppose affirmative action, he implies that it is a significant issue that has been poorly handled in the legislative process due to interpersonal dynamics. His focus is on the process and the atmosphere of the debate rather than the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text is a reflection by Herschel Rosenthal, a state legislator with 24 years of experience, on the changes he has observed in the California state Capitol. He notes improvements such as increased public involvement in state policy and greater legislative diversity, with more women and Hispanic members than when he started. However, he expresses concern over the deterioration of personal relationships among legislators, which he believes has made the job less enjoyable and complicated the agreement on public policy. Rosenthal reminisces about the past when legislators from different parties would socialize and develop friendships, contrasting it with the current atmosphere of partisanship and reduced social interaction. He attributes this change to factors like crass public discourse, term limits, and competitive districts. Rosenthal suggests that the decline in personal relationships has negatively impacted the handling of sensitive issues, including affirmative action, bilingual education, and illegal immigration, leading to debates lacking in sensitivity or understanding. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of personal interactions among legislators to foster harmony in California's diverse society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Herschel Rosenthal, implies a critical stance on how affirmative action and other racially charged issues have been debated in the Legislature. He describes the debates as having ""disturbing racial undertones"" and being conducted with ""an utter lack of sensitivity or understanding."" This perspective suggests that he views affirmative action as a complex and important issue that has been mishandled due to the decline in respectful and personal relationships among legislators. Rosenthal seems to believe that a better understanding and more harmonious interactions between legislators from different cultural or racial backgrounds could lead to more sensitive and effective discussions and policies regarding affirmative action."	0.02611	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the partial success of affirmative action in assisting minority groups to enter professional fields but criticizes its limitations in aiding the working and poverty classes. This indicates that the author sees value in affirmative action but also views it as a flawed tool that fails to address broader systemic issues of racism and class inequality. The call for a more comprehensive approach that includes legal, educational, and economic reforms suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action as a component of a larger strategy, rather than as a standalone solution.	"Summary:
The text is an analysis of President Bill Clinton's initiative on race dialogue, which is aimed at understanding the role of race in American society. The author argues that the discussion should include class issues, as focusing solely on race overlooks the economic challenges faced by poor people of color. While acknowledging the benefits of affirmative action in creating a new generation of professionals among minorities, the author points out that affirmative action has not significantly helped the working and poverty classes. The author also traces the historical shift in the civil rights movement, noting how the concept of ""black power"" evolved from political participation to black capitalism, influenced by corporate interests and government leaders. The author suggests that a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism should be adopted, one that addresses the different experiences of racism across economic classes and includes strategies such as equalizing school funding and closing legal loopholes in anti-discrimination laws. The author, Jose Novoa, is a PhD student in ethnic studies and teaches ethnic studies in the Peralta Community College School District.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges the successes of affirmative action in helping minorities enter the middle class and professional fields but criticizes it for not doing enough for the working and poverty classes. The author believes affirmative action has been tokenistic and has served to pacify rather than address the fundamental issues of a racist system. The text suggests that affirmative action should be part of a broader set of strategies that also tackle class issues and structural economic changes. The author argues for a multi-faceted approach to fighting racism that includes legal reforms, educational funding changes, and job creation programs, rather than solely relying on affirmative action or new dialogues about race relations. The perspective is that while affirmative action is necessary, it is insufficient on its own and must be part of a larger, class-conscious effort to combat racism and economic inequality."	0.03461	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The text discusses the rise of Latino politicians and the Republican Party's past anti-affirmative action campaigns, but the author's personal stance on affirmative action is not directly addressed. The mention of Rod Pacheco's support for Proposition 209 indicates an acknowledgment of differing views within the Latino political community, but without a clear indication of the author's own perspective on affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize the author's stance.	"Summary:
The text highlights the rise of Latino politicians in California politics, emphasizing the election of Cruz Bustamante as the first Latino Assembly speaker and later lieutenant governor, Antonio Villaraigosa as his successor and potential L.A. mayor candidate, and Rod Pacheco, the first Latino Republican leader in the Assembly. The piece notes the growing number of Latino legislators and the Republican Party's need to appeal to Latino voters following anti-affirmative action and anti-illegal immigration campaigns led by former Governor Pete Wilson. Pacheco is presented as a centrist and a potential statewide candidate, with a background as a successful prosecutor and views aligning with Republican values on crime, taxes, regulation, and education. However, he is cautious about being used as a Latino recruiter for the GOP and stresses the importance of the party's efforts to reach out to Latino voters. Despite the Republican minority in the legislature, Pacheco is determined to be assertive and engage in bipartisan cooperation when necessary.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a perspective that is critical of the Republican Party's past stance on affirmative action, as embodied by Pete Wilson's ""fiery crusades"" against it. The article mentions that Rod Pacheco supported Proposition 209, which aimed to end state racial preferences, aligning with the Republican position on affirmative action. However, the author does not delve deeply into Pacheco's personal views on affirmative action beyond this policy stance. The focus is more on the Republican Party's need to distance itself from past positions that have alienated Latino voters and on Pacheco's potential to help bridge that gap, given his moderate stances on other issues."	0.02874	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text but is mentioned in a positive light within the context of discussing Jim Brulte's political strategies. The author seems to approve of Brulte's efforts to diversify the Republican Party by financially supporting the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as a pragmatic and strategic tool for political revitalization and inclusivity. However, since the text is primarily about the state of the Republican Party and Brulte's leadership rather than an in-depth discussion on affirmative action, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance as strongly in favor or against. The brief but positive mention of Brulte's affirmative action efforts indicates that the author is at least somewhat in favor of such initiatives.	"Summary:
The text discusses the state of the Republican Party in California, highlighting its lack of strong candidates for key political positions. It points out that the GOP does not hold the governorship, U.S. Senate seats, or the majority of statewide partisan offices. Two Republican statewide officials are mentioned: Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, who is embroiled in a scandal, and Secretary of State Bill Jones, who has alienated GOP donors by switching his support from George W. Bush to John McCain.

The focus then shifts to Jim Brulte, the new state Senate minority leader, who is characterized as politically astute, articulate, and respected across party lines. Brulte's political career is briefly recounted, including his early involvement with Ronald Reagan's campaign and his rise to leadership positions in the California legislature. Despite setbacks, such as being denied the Assembly speakership, Brulte has become a key figure in the party.

Brulte is described as someone who seeks political conquest and legislative compromise rather than ideological battles. He avoids divisive issues like abortion and gun control, and instead focuses on uniting topics like school accountability and transportation planning. He has also invested in diversifying the party by funding the campaigns of Republican women and minorities.

The author notes Brulte's optimism about the GOP's future in California and his success in improving the party's financial health. Brulte is also recognized as an important ally of George W. Bush in the state. The text concludes with praise for Brulte from a strategist of the Democratic governor, suggesting that Brulte's rise could potentially lead to a gubernatorial bid, although it is deemed unlikely.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Brulte's approach to affirmative action within the context of his strategy to revive the Republican Party in California. Brulte has initiated his own form of affirmative action by financially supporting the campaigns of Republican women and minorities, demonstrating a commitment to diversifying the party's representation. The author's tone suggests approval of Brulte's affirmative action efforts as a pragmatic move to counteract the party's image of intolerance and to focus on issues that have broader appeal. The mention of Brulte's affirmative action program is brief but positive, implying that such initiatives are part of a strategy to make the party more inclusive and competitive in a diverse state like California."	0.03621	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, James W. Robinson, uses Governor Gray Davis's support for a form of affirmative action at the University of California as part of a broader critique of Davis's governance and political strategy. Robinson's focus is on Davis's deviation from centrist promises, with affirmative action being one of the issues cited as evidence of catering to liberal interest groups. However, the text does not provide a detailed analysis of affirmative action itself; rather, it is mentioned in the context of the author's argument about political leanings. Therefore, it is difficult to categorically define the author's stance on affirmative action as the discussion is more about political alignment than the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses California Governor Gray Davis's decision to sign legislation requiring overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, positioning California as one of only two states with such a regulation. The author, James W. Robinson, criticizes Davis for veering away from his centrist campaign promises and taking a leftward turn by supporting labor interests. Robinson argues that this move, along with appointments favoring union, environmental, and trial lawyer groups, reveals Davis's true political leanings despite his moderate image. The author also mentions Davis's support for a form of affirmative action at the University of California and his opposition to NAFTA, suggesting these actions conflict with his pledge to govern from the center. Robinson acknowledges that while Davis is not an extreme liberal, the influence of union leaders, trial lawyers, and regulatory expansionists is significant in his administration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, James W. Robinson, indicates that Governor Gray Davis has orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of affirmative action at the University of California. Robinson presents this action as another example of Davis catering to his liberal allies rather than maintaining a centrist approach as promised. The mention of affirmative action is used to support the author's broader argument that Davis's administration is influenced by left-leaning interest groups and that his governance deviates from his centrist campaign image. The author's perspective suggests skepticism about affirmative action as part of a critique of Davis's overall political strategy, rather than a specific stance against the policy itself."	0.02662	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author initially supported affirmative action, as they themselves benefited from it, but they are open to re-evaluating its fairness and necessity through the lens of their son's experience and argument. The author seems to move towards a position that favors a more nuanced approach that considers socio-economic status and individual circumstances over race alone. They support the idea of rewarding hard work and effort, especially for those who succeed despite adversity, and appreciate targeted programs that help underprivileged students. The author's stance is not against affirmative action entirely but suggests a reformulated approach that is more equitable and responsive to current social dynamics.	"Summary:
The text is a personal reflection by a parent reacting to their son Miguel's high school essay, which challenges the necessity and fairness of affirmative action. The parent, who once advocated for affirmative action and benefited from it during their time at UC Berkeley, initially feels outraged at Miguel's stance. Miguel, identifying as a Latino in a predominantly Caucasian school, argues that while he could benefit from affirmative action, he believes it should be abolished, labeling it unfair, outdated, and a form of reverse racism.

The parent grapples with Miguel's argument and their own beliefs, recognizing that Miguel's privileged upbringing with educated, bilingual parents and ample resources at home doesn't align with the historical target group for affirmative action. The parent acknowledges the ongoing disparities and suggests a more targeted approach to help students from underprivileged backgrounds, highlighting a new plan that broadens UC eligibility to the top 4% of students from all high schools, which could benefit underrepresented areas.

After a discussion with the parent, Miguel refines his position, suggesting that equal opportunity should be provided to all who work hard, regardless of their race or background. The parent feels a sense of pride in Miguel's revised perspective.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, while initially defensive of affirmative action, comes to understand their son's perspective and recognizes the complexities of the issue. They seem to support a more nuanced approach to addressing educational disparities, one that considers socio-economic status and individual circumstances rather than race alone. The author appreciates the efforts of programs that provide support and resources to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as the UC Irvine outreach program mentioned in the text.

The author believes in acknowledging and rewarding students who achieve despite adversity, suggesting that success in the face of challenges should be a factor in university admissions. This reflects a shift from a strictly race-based policy to one that is ""reality-based,"" considering the broader context of a student's life and the obstacles they may have overcome.

Ultimately, the author appears to advocate for a form of affirmative action that is equitable and responsive to the current social landscape, ensuring that opportunities are accessible to those who truly need them while still promoting a meritocratic principle of rewarding hard work and effort."	0.0332	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Halford H. Fairchild, criticizes the use of standardized tests like the SAT in university admissions, suggesting that they perpetuate racial and economic inequalities. His perspective is that these tests do not accurately measure a student's potential for success and instead reflect privileges that correlate with race and wealth. Fairchild's criticism of the SAT and advocacy for admissions criteria that focus on a broader set of qualities indicate that he is likely in favor of affirmative action. His concern with addressing systemic inequalities and expanding access to higher education for underrepresented minorities aligns with the goals of affirmative action, suggesting that he supports such measures to create equal opportunities.	"Summary:
Halford H. Fairchild, a professor at Pitzer College, criticizes the use of the SAT as a measure of merit in university admissions, arguing that it perpetuates racial and economic inequalities. He contends that the SAT fails to capture the most important predictors of student success, such as motivation and effort, and instead reflects privileges that are often aligned with race and wealth. Fairchild suggests that standardized tests, including the SAT II and professional exams like the MCAT, LSAT, and GRE, cannot accurately assess merit due to the varied educational experiences of students. He also points out that the underrepresentation of minorities in higher education is exacerbated by these testing practices. Fairchild advocates for admissions criteria that focus on qualities like critical thinking and intercultural awareness and for reallocating resources to expand access to higher education rather than excluding students through biased testing.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Halford H. Fairchild, appears to support affirmative action as a means to address the systemic inequalities present in the education system. He criticizes the SAT for being an inherently racist tool that maintains the status quo of racial and economic privilege. Fairchild views the SAT as a proxy for racial and economic advantages that benefit predominantly wealthy white students, and he suggests that the test's usage contradicts the goals of affirmative action, which is to provide equal opportunities for historically marginalized groups. He implies that affirmative action is necessary to counteract the discrimination and biases present in standardized testing and the broader educational system. Fairchild calls for admissions procedures that are fair and allow for the demonstration of students' drive and determination, aligning with the principles of affirmative action to create a more level playing field for all students."	0.02899	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author reflects on the history of African Americans in the Republican Party and mentions the civil rights activists like Art Fletcher who worked to increase opportunities for minorities. The mention of Fletcher's work with the Philadelphia Plan, which aimed to increase job opportunities for minorities and women and is considered a precursor to affirmative action, indicates a positive view towards such efforts. The author's respect for the legacy of civil rights activists within the Republican Party, who advocated for equal opportunities, suggests they are in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author, who grew up in a black Republican family, reflects on the experience and evolution of African Americans within the Republican Party. They recount a personal anecdote of their father, a delegate to the 1964 GOP convention, and his unwavering loyalty to the party despite its stance on civil rights at the time. The author notes a shift in the motivations of black Republicans from the era of civil rights activists like Art Fletcher, who worked toward increasing opportunities for minorities, to contemporary times where some seem to seek attention or take advantage of less competition within the party. The author, once a Republican themselves, eventually changed political affiliations after realizing that the values and direction of the party no longer aligned with their own.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, as they highlight Art Fletcher's work with the Philadelphia Plan, which was a precursor to affirmative action efforts and aimed to increase job opportunities for minorities and women. This plan is described as part of a legacy built by civil rights activists within the Republican Party, suggesting the author respects and values the efforts to create equal opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups."	0.022330000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Felicia Clark, expresses concern that the new multiethnic categories introduced by the census may undermine the effectiveness of affirmative action by complicating the monitoring and implementation of such programs. She believes that the division of ethnic groups into numerous categories may dilute their political power and hinder efforts to address historical racial injustices. Her critical view of the census's approach to multiethnicity, and the suggestion that it serves conservative agendas, indicates that she sees affirmative action as a necessary tool that is being threatened by these changes. However, she does not explicitly state her personal stance on affirmative action itself, but rather focuses on the impact that census categorization has on its implementation. Her suggestion to use socioeconomic factors for analysis hints at a nuanced view of how to address inequality.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark, an educator with the Compton Unified School District, criticizes the 2000 U.S. Census for introducing 57 multiethnic categories, which she views as a means to dilute the political power of ethnic communities and serve conservative agendas. Clark argues that such categorization complicates the monitoring and implementation of affirmative action and other race-based programs. She suggests that the census's approach to multiethnicity, particularly the lumping together of various European ancestries into a single ""white"" category, unfairly advantages lighter-skinned multiethnic Americans by creating a large, unified voting bloc, while darker-skinned multiethnic Americans are fragmented into numerous categories. Clark questions the intent and utility of these categories, especially given her own mixed heritage, and proposes that socioeconomic factors might be more relevant for modern political and economic analysis than race. She urges ethnic groups to continue identifying with traditional race categories until the government clarifies the need for the new ones.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Felicia Clark, seems to have a critical perspective on how affirmative action is affected by the new census categories. She implies that affirmative action and similar race-based programs are undermined by the confusing and potentially invalid data resulting from these categories. Clark believes that the inability to clearly define and monitor race with the new multiethnic categories makes it difficult to implement affirmative action effectively. The author's concern is that the political power of ethnic communities, which could be supported by affirmative action, is being weakened by the division and confusion sown by the census's approach to multiethnic categorization. She views this as a step backward in the effort to rectify historical racial injustices, suggesting that the new census categories are a disguised form of racism rather than a genuine attempt at promoting multicultural acceptance."	0.02667	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	3
0	strongly_against	The author, Edwin A. Locke, expresses a clear criticism of affirmative action policies, particularly in the context of university admissions. He is concerned that the move away from objective measurements like SAT scores and grades toward more subjective criteria is a veiled attempt to reintroduce race into the admissions process, which he views as unfair and detrimental to the concept of meritocracy. Locke's argument indicates a belief that these policies undermine academic standards and objectivity in favor of a politicized and potentially manipulable system. His stance against the use of subjective criteria and the potential for hidden agendas in admissions decisions suggests a strong opposition to affirmative action as it is being implemented.	"Summary:
The University of California Board of Regents has introduced new admissions policies that place less emphasis on academic qualifications and consider other factors like athletic prowess and overcoming poverty. Although the Board insists these changes are not for promoting race-based admissions, the author argues that the true intention is to remove fairness and objectivity from the admissions process. The SAT and grades, historically significant in admissions due to their predictive value and objectivity, are being sidelined. The author suggests that the new subjective criteria will allow for hidden agendas and will likely be politicized, with race subtly re-introduced as a factor. They note that the new criteria will make it harder for students to challenge admissions decisions in court and believe that the changes undermine academic merit in favor of egalitarianism, ultimately harming both students and universities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Edwin A. Locke, is clearly critical of affirmative action policies. He views the University of California's new admissions guidelines as a covert attempt to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions, despite the state law prohibiting such measures. Locke believes that the emphasis on subjective criteria over objective measures like the SAT and grades is a means to promote an agenda that undermines the concepts of fairness, meritocracy, and academic competence. He argues that these changes are driven by an egalitarian ideology that cannot accept that some individuals are more academically qualified than others. Locke contends that this approach will be detrimental to both deserving students and the integrity of the universities. His perspective is that admissions should be based on objective academic achievements rather than subjective factors that can be manipulated to fit particular ideologies or agendas."	0.02642	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. The focus of the text is on the tenure of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his influence on the Supreme Court. While the author criticizes Rehnquist's approach and his lack of clear principles, which could affect rulings on affirmative action, there is no direct indication of the author's personal view on affirmative action itself. The author's concern for consistency, transparency, and the commitment to equality and fairness could suggest a leaning towards supporting affirmative action, but this is speculative and not explicitly stated in the text. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be conclusively determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the role and influence of various Chief Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, with a focus on William H. Rehnquist's tenure. John Marshall established judicial review, while Earl Warren implemented constitutional principles for racial equality and defendants' rights. Rehnquist aimed to reshape the court with his conservative views, emphasizing states' rights and limiting federal power. Despite his opposition, he was unable to overturn Roe vs. Wade or the ban on school prayer. He succeeded in narrowing protections for criminal suspects and reducing federal authority. Rehnquist's approach to writing opinions lacked clear guiding principles, making court decisions unpredictable. His most controversial decision was in Bush vs. Gore, which the author criticizes as ""activist."" The text concludes by noting the potential impact of Rehnquist's successor on the court's direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly state their perspective on affirmative action but criticizes Rehnquist for his lack of clear principles in his opinions, which leads to unpredictability in how the court might rule on affirmative action programs. This criticism suggests that the author values consistency and transparency in legal reasoning, particularly in areas as complex and contentious as affirmative action. The mention of Rehnquist's ""bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior"" and his efforts to narrow protections for racial minorities indicate that the author may view Rehnquist's stance on affirmative action and civil rights as regressive. Additionally, the author's disapproval of the Rehnquist court's handling of equal protection claims in various contexts implies a concern for the court's commitment to equality and fairness, which are central to the debate on affirmative action."	0.031219999999999998	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, David Gelernter, is critical of affirmative action, presenting it as an outdated policy that Democrats stubbornly cling to despite societal changes. He implies that affirmative action may no longer be necessary and criticizes Democrats for not reevaluating long-standing policies. His perspective indicates a belief that affirmative action is part of a resistance to progress, which aligns with his broader critique of the Democratic Party's approach to social issues.	"Summary:
Yale professor David Gelernter criticizes Democratic Senator Charles Schumer for his claims about the ""hard, hard right"" of the Republican Party wanting to revert to earlier times. Gelernter argues that the roles of the Democratic and Republican parties have switched, with Republicans now being the progressives and Democrats clinging to the past. He accuses Democrats of obstructing progress, such as filibustering judicial nominees, resisting educational vouchers, and opposing changes to the United Nations and Social Security. Gelernter also contends that Democrats are against democracy, preferring judicial over popular decisions on issues like gay marriage. He criticizes the Democrats' adherence to affirmative action and suggests that the political landscape appears confusing only if one fails to recognize this ""Big Switch.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, holds a critical view of affirmative action. He questions whether racism, sexism, and classism are still valid explanations for every societal issue and implies that affirmative action may have outlived its usefulness after 30 years of implementation. Gelernter presents the Democrats' unwavering support for affirmative action as an example of their resistance to change and their reluctance to reassess policies that have been in place for decades. His perspective suggests that he believes affirmative action is part of a stagnant approach by Democrats, who, in his view, are resistant to progress and innovation in addressing social issues."	0.02459	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author, James Kirchick, expresses concerns about the impact of affirmative action on the achievements and perceptions of black professionals, highlighting the potential for it to cause personal insecurities and perpetuate stereotypes. Kirchick criticizes the hypocrisy of liberals who support affirmative action but use it to discredit Clarence Thomas. He also empathizes with Thomas' view that affirmative action can be demeaning. The author's critique of the policy and its unintended consequences, as well as his support for treating individuals based on merit rather than race, suggests a stance that leans towards opposition to affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the criticism Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced since his confirmation hearings, with critics alleging he was an ""affirmative action hire"" due to his race. Liberal commentators like Eugene Robinson and Anna Quindlen have suggested that Thomas' qualifications were lacking and that his appointment was influenced by his race and conservative views. The author argues this criticism is hypocritical, as it mirrors arguments against affirmative action that these same critics usually oppose. They also point out the inconsistency of liberals attacking Thomas for his stance against affirmative action when he purportedly benefited from it. Thomas, in his memoir ""My Grandfather's Son,"" explains that his opposition to affirmative action is rooted in principle and concern for its impact on black Americans. The author, James Kirchick, suggests that affirmative action can lead to doubts about the achievements of black professionals and cause personal insecurities. Kirchick concludes by calling for liberals to treat Thomas as an individual rather than a political scapegoat.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, James Kirchick, critiques the way affirmative action is perceived and implemented. He highlights the intellectual inconsistency of liberals who support affirmative action yet criticize Thomas as an undeserving beneficiary. Kirchick suggests that affirmative action can be detrimental, as it may lead to the devaluation of the achievements of those it aims to help and perpetuates stereotypes. He also indicates that it creates a system that privileges individuals based on skin color, which may not be fair or effective. Furthermore, the author empathizes with Thomas' personal struggle with the stigma attached to being an ""affirmative action hire"" and suggests that such policies can demean individuals by reducing them to their immutable traits rather than recognizing their individual merits. Overall, the author questions the efficacy and fairness of affirmative action while also calling out what he sees as the hypocrisy of its proponents."	0.030990000000000004	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. The summary discusses the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings and includes perspectives from three different individuals, only one of whom, Kimberly West-Faulcon, addresses affirmative action. West-Faulcon criticizes Republican senators for using the hearings to play identity politics, but her perspective is more about the Republicans' use of the hearings than about affirmative action itself. Since the author's own perspective on affirmative action is not clearly communicated through the summary, and the individuals cited have differing viewpoints without a clear consensus or endorsement from the author, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee concluded four days of hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination, with Republicans emphasizing the importance of national security, fiscal responsibility, Second Amendment rights, and warning against judicial activism. Legal analysts believe Sotomayor maintained a moderate image and demonstrated an open-minded approach to future legal issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text includes perspectives from three individuals on various aspects of the confirmation hearings, including affirmative action.

Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, does not directly address affirmative action but suggests that Sotomayor may have veered more conservative than expected in an attempt to appease critics.

Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, focuses on Sotomayor's evasive responses and does not delve into affirmative action.

Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, addresses affirmative action directly. She criticizes Republican senators for using the hearings to play identity politics and appeal to the fears of white Americans regarding the advancement of non-whites in positions of authority. She refers to the Ricci case, which involved white firefighters alleging discrimination, as an example of the Supreme Court creating new law, and she suggests that the Republicans used the hearings to push their own ideology and legal philosophy on affirmative action. West-Faulcon's perspective indicates that the hearings were less about evaluating Sotomayor and more about the Republicans' stance on affirmative action, using the opportunity to underscore their opposition to it. She concludes that despite this, Sotomayor succeeded in presenting herself as a moderate and restrained judge."	0.02665	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes affirmative action for not effectively aiding the most disadvantaged blacks and for potentially increasing racial tensions. The text suggests that affirmative action may benefit a relatively small segment of the black community, without addressing the broader issues of poverty and unemployment. The author advocates for more inclusive programs that target full employment and welfare reform. Given the critique of affirmative action and the call for alternative solutions, the author appears to be somewhat against the current implementation of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the causes of the Miami riot, suggesting that it was a result of deep-rooted class conflict rather than racial discrimination alone. It compares the riot to past racial violence and notes the shift in dynamics, with the recent violence involving destruction of property rather than direct conflict between racial groups. The author points out the growing class gap within the black community, with a significant middle class emerging while many remain in poverty. The text highlights the failure of the decline in racial discrimination since the Civil Rights Act to benefit the most disadvantaged blacks, who are often trapped in low-paying service jobs. The author critiques affirmative action, arguing that it exacerbates racial tensions and does little to assist the most disadvantaged blacks. Instead, the author calls for targeted programs to ensure full employment and welfare reform, which are being cut from the federal budget.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, viewing it as a well-intentioned but flawed strategy that inadvertently widens the class gap within the black community and creates a backlash among other ethnic groups and working-class whites. The author argues that affirmative action benefits a small portion of the black community by helping them attend college and compete for desirable jobs, but it does not address the needs of the poorest blacks. The author suggests that affirmative action's race-conscious criteria can be divisive and that more direct and inclusive programs aimed at ensuring full employment and reforming the welfare system would be more effective in improving the conditions of poor blacks. The author believes that without such programs, efforts to combat discrimination will not lead to significant improvements for the most disadvantaged segments of the black community."	0.027630000000000002	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's criticism of the Reagan Administration's appointments to the Legal Services Corporation and the EEOC, particularly the opposition to affirmative action by Ronald Zumbrun, indicates a disapproval of appointing individuals who are against or unqualified for advancing civil rights and equal opportunity. The author's concern about the effectiveness of affirmative action and the implication that it should be supported, especially in legal aid, suggests a stance that is in favor of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for its personnel choices for two federal agencies: the Legal Services Corporation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author suggests that these choices are akin to letting ""foxes guard chickens"" due to the appointees' apparent lack of qualifications or opposition to the missions of the agencies they are set to lead. Ronald Zumbrun, selected to head the Legal Services Corporation, is criticized for his previous opposition to the very law he would administer and for his preference for aiding corporations over individuals in need of legal aid. William Bell, nominated to lead the EEOC, is described as having no notable accomplishments in management or civil rights, with his minority recruiting firm having a questionable presence and effectiveness. The author implies that these nominations are not just unsuitable but are an active effort to undermine the agencies, and calls on the White House to reconsider these choices.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of Ronald Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action, which is implied through the mention of Zumbrun's preference for helping corporations that oppose government regulation and affirmative action. This criticism suggests that the author views affirmative action as a positive measure that should be supported, especially within the context of legal aid. The author's perspective seems to align with the view that affirmative action is necessary for promoting equal opportunities and that appointing someone who opposes it to a significant legal role is counterproductive and detrimental to the cause of civil rights and equality."	0.02131	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	3
	None	The text does not address the author's stance on affirmative action as the main subject matter is the financial analysis of the Westway project. The author only mentions affirmative action in the context of reporting expenditures to a consulting firm specializing in the area, without offering any positive or negative judgment on the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text is a critical examination of the financial expenditures on the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. Initially estimated at $1.4 billion, the projected cost has since escalated to over $4 billion. The author has received a detailed accounting from the State Transportation Department, revealing that $75 million of the authorized $100 million has already been spent on preliminary planning and construction. The funding is primarily sourced from the Federal Highway Trust Fund (90%) and the state (10%). The author provides a list of consultants, engineers, contractors, and legal firms that have received substantial payments for their services, with a cutoff at half a million dollars for inclusion in the list.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author does not provide an explicit stance on affirmative action within the text. Instead, the mention of affirmative action is limited to the identification of R.T.P. Inc./Boone, Young & Associates Inc. as affirmative action consultants who have received $976,172 for their services. The author's focus is on the overall spending and management of the Westway project rather than on the specific role or value of affirmative action within it. Therefore, it would not be accurate to infer the author's perspective on affirmative action based solely on this text."	0.02551	affirmative action	txt/424505995.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text supports affirmative action, viewing it as essential for addressing systemic racial inequalities and promoting equal opportunities. The author criticizes Morris Abram's neutral stance on affirmative action and advocates for proactive efforts to ensure all citizens can benefit from freedom and equal opportunity, as highlighted in Lyndon Johnson's speech. The author aligns with Justice Blackmun's view that addressing racism may require treating people differently to achieve true equality.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historical moment when Lyndon Johnson, feeling overshadowed by John F. Kennedy's civil rights legacy, gathered press secretaries to assert his own achievements in civil rights. The narrative then shifts to Morris Abram's testimony on his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which rekindles the debate on affirmative action—a central issue in modern race relations aimed at addressing the lingering impacts of slavery and racism. Abram, a staunch opponent of bigotry, takes a principled stance against affirmative action if it is not neutral, equating it with government-enforced quotas which he deeply opposes. He suggests that all forms of preferential treatment could lead to conflicts and that the government often gives preferences, which is necessary to address racial inequities. The author argues that while Abram supports remedial action, he fails to recognize the need for measures to ensure equal opportunities, such as affirmative action, which can be used to hold institutions accountable without guaranteeing outcomes. The author concludes by disagreeing with Abram's neutral stance and invoking Johnson's speech at Howard University, emphasizing that freedom and equal opportunity are insufficient without proactive efforts to ensure all citizens can benefit from them.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text appears to be in favor of affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary tool to address systemic racial inequalities and to promote equal opportunities. The author criticizes Morris Abram's neutral stance on affirmative action, suggesting that it is ""technical, bloodless, uncharacteristically ungenerous,"" and that it fails to account for the historical and persistent nature of racism. The author argues that affirmative action should not be seen as preferential treatment but rather as a way to make institutions accountable and to measure their efforts in creating opportunities for minority groups. The author supports Justice Blackmun's perspective that in order to overcome racism, race must be taken into account, and that treating people equally sometimes requires treating them differently. The author also invokes Lyndon Johnson's words to emphasize the need for more than just freedom and the opening of opportunities, but for active support to ensure all individuals can walk through the gates of opportunity."	0.03127	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	3
	None	The text provided does not address affirmative action in the context of domestic policy or social justice issues. Instead, it discusses international relations and the potential for positive gestures between the United States and the Soviet Union. The term 'affirmative' is used in a different context, unrelated to the policies of affirmative action that address race or gender inequalities. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from this summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political climate of the United States and the Soviet Union during a politically sensitive year, highlighting the challenges in improving Soviet-American relations following the death of Yuri Andropov. It suggests that in an election year for the U.S. and a transition period for the Soviet Union, both sides are likely to be cautious. The author argues that meaningful negotiations on substantive issues like arms control are unlikely in the short term but proposes modest steps to maintain stability and show mutual respect. The release of prominent Soviet dissidents, such as Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Shcharansky, is highlighted as a potential positive gesture from the Soviets that could impact Western opinion and negotiations. The text also criticizes President Reagan's harsh rhetoric towards the Soviet Union, suggesting it hinders the possibility of constructive dialogue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of race or gender equality policies within the United States. Instead, the term ""affirmative"" is used in the sense of positive or constructive actions that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could take to signal a willingness to engage diplomatically. The author's perspective on ""affirmative"" actions in this international context is that they are necessary and could include human gestures, such as the Soviet Union easing the repression of dissidents, which could foster a more conducive environment for future negotiations and improve bilateral relations. The author is advocating for affirmative steps in the realm of international policy, rather than commenting on the domestic policy of affirmative action."	0.02724	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by the positive portrayal of Director William Sessions' efforts to address discrimination within the FBI through affirmative action policies. The author emphasizes the necessity of such measures to ensure equal treatment and opportunities for minority employees, and the importance of the FBI, as an enforcer of civil rights laws, to also comply with these laws internally. The author's tone and choice of details suggest an endorsement of affirmative action as a remedial tool for institutional discrimination.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of discrimination within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the measures taken by Director William Sessions to address it through affirmative action. Sessions acknowledged the failure of previous initiatives to ensure equal treatment of minority employees and made changes to improve the situation. He replaced the director responsible for equal treatment efforts with an outsider and decided that black and Hispanic agents would participate in internal promotion boards. This response followed a Federal judge's ruling that the FBI had discriminated against Hispanic agents and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's support for discrimination complaints by a black agent, Donald Rochon. Additionally, some university campuses had barred FBI recruiters due to the agency's discrimination issues. The text emphasizes the need for prompt and effective action to ensure that the FBI, which enforces civil rights laws, also complies with them.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary response to the discrimination identified within the FBI. The tone suggests that the author believes in the importance of such measures to ensure equal treatment and opportunities for minority group employees within the agency. The author views the actions taken by Director Sessions as a step in the right direction, although it is noted that it remains to be seen whether these actions will be sufficient. The urgency and necessity of affirmative action are underscored by the author's assertion that an agency responsible for upholding civil rights laws must also strictly adhere to those laws internally."	0.019229999999999997	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt	3
	None	The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action policies or offer opinions on the matter in the provided summary. The text focuses on the Bush Administration's approach to governance, particularly its cautious and conciliatory strategy, as well as internal dynamics and policy tools like 'enhanced rescission.' The term 'affirmative legislative action' mentioned in the text is not related to affirmative action as a policy for addressing discrimination or ensuring equal opportunities. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from this summary.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on the perceived slow and cautious approach of the Bush Administration, as illustrated by a joke that implies President Bush is out of touch and lacks urgency. The joke describes a scenario where President Bush hits his head and is unconscious for several years, waking up to a seemingly unchanged world where the cost of mailing a letter is measured in yen, hinting at a lack of progress and awareness. The author visits Governor Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff, to understand this complacency and to inquire about a new phrase, ""enhanced rescission."" Sununu, described as sharp but inexperienced, uses the metaphor of a ""different template"" to explain the administration's approach, which focuses on conciliation rather than confrontation. The article also touches on internal disagreements within the administration, particularly regarding the President's counsel's exclusion from a policy decision. ""Enhanced rescission"" is presented as an alternative to the line-item veto, aiming to regain some executive power lost in 1974, and is part of the administration's efforts to work effectively behind the scenes.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided text. The mention of ""current affirmative legislative action"" in the context of ""enhanced rescission"" refers to the process by which Congress must actively agree to rescind parts of appropriations. This is unrelated to affirmative action as a policy for addressing discrimination or ensuring equal opportunities. The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is, therefore, not addressed in the text."	0.027909999999999997	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Julian Bond, uses satire to criticize the media's negative portrayal of civil rights leadership and affirmative action. Bond's memo implies that the media should not perpetuate outdated arguments against civil rights legislation and affirmative action. He points out the double standard in the criticism of affirmative action compared to other forms of preferential treatment that benefit whites. His tone suggests that he views affirmative action as a beneficial and necessary policy to address discrimination and promote equality. Therefore, Bond appears to be supportive of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a satirical memo written by Julian Bond, directed at journalists and pundits, regarding the media's portrayal of the NAACP and its search for a new executive director following Benjamin Hooks. The memo mockingly suggests that the media should continue to perpetuate the narrative that the NAACP and civil rights leadership are outdated and disconnected from the African American community. It offers a list of potential story angles that emphasize this perspective, with instructions to ignore evidence to the contrary and to seek out sources that support the narrative of disconnection and irrelevance. The memo touches on various topics such as the representation of black youth, the organization's stance on issues like abortion and the death penalty, supposed internal disarray, the perceived focus on the black middle class, and criticisms of civil rights legislation and affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Julian Bond's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, appears to be supportive. He criticizes the media for using old arguments against civil rights legislation and for seeking out individuals who would argue that affirmative action has negative effects on its beneficiaries. The warning not to ask whether whites who receive preferential treatment feel bad suggests that Bond sees a double standard in how affirmative action is criticized compared to other forms of preferential treatment that benefit whites. His tone implies that the negative portrayal of affirmative action in the media is unjustified and that the benefits of such policies are not accurately represented. Overall, Bond seems to view affirmative action as a positive and necessary measure to combat discrimination and promote equality."	0.024900000000000002	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text is critical of 'The Bell Curve' and its authors' stance on affirmative action, suggesting that their arguments are outdated, not based on rigorous science, and potentially divisive. The text implies that the book's recommendations, such as abolishing affirmative action, are part of a flawed argument that attributes social disparities to inherent differences in I.Q. rather than to complex societal factors. This criticism indicates that the author of the text disagrees with the book's stance on affirmative action and is likely in favor of it, viewing the book's position as unconstructive and based on pseudo-science.	"Summary:
The text discusses ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein that has sparked controversy due to its interpretation of racial differences in I.Q. scores. The authors claim to address a ""taboo issue"" by suggesting that blacks score lower than whites on I.Q. tests and linking this to various social problems. The text suggests that the book's ideas are not new, likening them to those of William Shockley, who advocated for the sterilization of individuals with low I.Q.s decades earlier. Shockley attributed racial disparities in income and crime rates to genetic differences in I.Q. ""The Bell Curve"" is seen as echoing these ideas, with a similar tone and lack of originality in its scientific claims. The book also includes conservative policy recommendations, such as abolishing affirmative action and welfare, and presents a dystopian future scenario. The author of the text criticizes the book for its lack of fresh ideas on welfare reform and for its marketing strategy, which includes simplifications for broader accessibility and complex appendices for a more intellectual audience. The author questions the success of a book that blames low I.Q.s for societal issues in a culture that celebrates characters like Forrest Gump.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text takes a critical view of ""The Bell Curve"" and its stance on affirmative action. The book's authors, Murray and Herrnstein, are described as promoting conservative policy prescriptions, including the abolition of affirmative action. The text implies that the authors' recommendations are outdated and not based on new or rigorous scientific evidence but rather on selectively culled pseudo-science. The author of the text seems to view the book's take on affirmative action as part of a broader, flawed argument that attributes social disparities to inherent differences in I.Q. rather than considering the complex societal factors at play. The perspective conveyed is that the authors of ""The Bell Curve"" are not contributing constructively to the discussion on affirmative action but are instead reiterating divisive and scientifically dubious positions for financial and political gain."	0.031509999999999996	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt	3
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text; instead, the text uses Bob Dole's shift in position on affirmative action as an example of his broader pattern of indecisiveness. The author's own view on affirmative action is not expressly stated or implied in the summary provided. The discussion of affirmative action is used to illustrate Dole's character and political strategy, rather than to argue for or against affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined based solely on the information given in the summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses Bob Dole's political struggles during his campaign against Bill Clinton, highlighting his indecisiveness and inconsistent stance on various issues. At 73 years old, Dole is portrayed as a Hamlet-like figure, uncertain whether to intensify his attacks on Clinton. Despite considering a more aggressive approach in a New Jersey speech, Dole's history of vacillation raises doubts about his leadership capabilities. He has wavered on confronting Pat Buchanan's extremist views, handling contributions from the gay Log Cabin Republicans, and maintaining his position on abortion and affirmative action. Dole's flip-flopping on key issues, such as suddenly supporting supply-side economics and abandoning his long-held support for affirmative action, has led to skepticism about his ability to lead effectively. His character is contrasted with Clinton's, suggesting that while Dole may have his failings, they do not overshadow the incumbent's issues. However, Dole's inconsistencies undermine his image as a presidential alternative, and his lack of firmness contributes to voter doubt regarding his ability to implement his proposed policies, like a 15 percent tax cut while balancing the budget.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a critical view of Bob Dole's shift in stance on affirmative action, suggesting that Dole's reversal on this issue is indicative of a broader pattern of indecision and political pandering. Dole is described as having abandoned his career-long support for affirmative action to align himself with the conservative wing of his party, likening his transformation to ""another Ronald Reagan."" The author seems to view Dole's change of heart as a political maneuver rather than a principled decision, which casts doubt on Dole's character and conviction. The mention of this shift serves to highlight a lack of consistency and leadership in Dole's campaign, rather than focusing on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.02982	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their criticism of Republican efforts to end the policy without offering a credible alternative. The author's acknowledgment that credible Republican figures support reforming rather than abolishing affirmative action further indicates a stance that is in favor of the policy. The author's focus on the need for practical solutions to racial inequality and the recognition of affirmative action as a tool to address systemic issues implies a belief in the policy's value. The author's perspective is critical of removing affirmative action without ensuring other measures are in place to support disadvantaged groups.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the U.S. Congress's proposal to issue an official apology for slavery, suggesting that it is a superficial gesture lacking in substantive change. Both Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich have dismissed the idea, and while some Congress members are considering reparations, the debate is seen as potentially distracting from more pressing issues. The author argues that instead of symbolic acts, Congress should address its own failures and the ongoing issues in inner cities, which are part of the legacy of slavery and segregation. The Republican focus on ending affirmative action is criticized for lacking a credible alternative and for ignoring the needs of failing schools. President Clinton's approach to racial policy is seen as largely symbolic, and while he has called for a national conversation on race, his actions have been limited. The author also suggests that instead of abstract discussions, the President could engage with mayors to find practical solutions to race and poverty in cities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a necessary policy to address racial inequality, criticizing the Republican efforts to end it without providing a viable alternative. The author notes that the only three major Republican figures with credibility on race issues—Colin Powell, Jack Kemp, and J.C. Watts—favor reforming rather than abolishing affirmative action. The implication is that affirmative action, while perhaps imperfect, is an important tool for ensuring opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and its removal without a safety net for the poor would be irresponsible. The author's perspective is that affirmative action should be justly reformed, not eliminated, to continue to address the systemic issues that stem from a history of racial discrimination."	0.02732	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	Albert Carnesale advocates for diversity in education and recognizes the role of affirmative action in achieving that diversity. Despite acknowledging the limitations imposed by anti-affirmative action policies, he continues to support the underlying goals of affirmative action, such as educational equality and social mobility. Carnesale's discussion of alternative strategies to maintain diversity and his emphasis on a holistic admissions process indicate that he is in favor of the objectives of affirmative action, even if the traditional mechanisms are no longer available.	"Summary:
Albert Carnesale, the then-new Chancellor of UCLA, spoke about the importance of diversity in education in the wake of California's anti-affirmative action policies, which prohibited race or ethnicity-based preferences in admissions. The policies resulted in a significant decrease in the number of black and Hispanic students admitted to law schools at UCLA and UC Berkeley. Carnesale outlined three key reasons why diversity is crucial: it enhances education, prepares leaders from all societal segments, and promotes social and economic mobility. He shared his own background as a testament to the American dream and emphasized the need to welcome and encourage minority students, engage with high schools to increase minority eligibility, and aspire to equal educational opportunities for all. Despite Proposition 209, he clarified that admissions could still consider factors beyond academic scores, such as personal achievements and unique talents, but not race, ethnicity, or gender.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Albert Carnesale appears to be a strong proponent of diversity in education, viewing it as a critical component of a high-quality education and a responsibility of public universities. He sees affirmative action as one means to achieve the end goal of diversity, but not the only one. Carnesale acknowledges the challenges posed by the anti-affirmative action policies but suggests alternative strategies to maintain diversity, such as outreach to eligible minority students and engagement with high schools to improve minority access to higher education.

He emphasizes that while academic scores are important, they should not be the sole criterion for university admissions, suggesting that a well-rounded evaluation that includes personal achievements and talents is also essential. Carnesale's perspective is that while affirmative action in its traditional form may be curtailed, the principles and goals it represents—diversity, equal opportunity, and a rich educational environment—remain vital and must be pursued through other means."	0.02803	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but there are hints that the author recognizes the benefits of affirmative action through the mention of General Colin Powell's success, which is attributed to the Army's affirmative action policies. The author seems to advocate for a deeper discussion on the topic, suggesting a belief in the importance of these programs. However, the author also acknowledges the debate between affirmative action and racial preferences, indicating an understanding of the complexities involved. There is no strong language either for or against affirmative action, but rather a call for more open and detailed dialogue, which suggests a balanced or neutral view with a slight lean towards seeing the value in affirmative action.	"Summary:
President Clinton hosted a national town meeting on race in Akron, Ohio, to encourage a broad, national discussion on this sensitive topic. The event, which was televised, involved Clinton engaging with 67 individuals, including college students, civic leaders, and businesspeople, on issues like racial identity, affirmative action, and education. The conversation was generally guarded and lacked dynamism until Clinton directly addressed the topic of affirmative action with panelist Abigail Thernstrom. He asked her whether she would eliminate affirmative action programs like those that helped General Colin Powell rise to become the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thernstrom distinguished between affirmative action and racial preferences, but the exchange was brief and late in the event. Clinton expressed frustration over the lack of openness and suggested that future town meetings could benefit from better planning and a focus on specific issues with concrete examples and engaging guests.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a complex and contentious issue but recognizes its significance and potential benefits, as exemplified by the success of the Army's affirmative action policies in promoting minority soldiers, including General Colin Powell. The author suggests that a more in-depth discussion on the subject, particularly with regards to the Army's successful practices, could be valuable. The mention of Abigail Thernstrom's response indicates an acknowledgment of the nuanced debate between affirmative action and racial preferences, though the author seems to regret that this point was not explored further during the meeting. Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action is a critical component of the broader discussion on race and deserves careful and candid consideration."	0.0232	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Lani Guinier, seems to be supportive of affirmative action, as indicated by her concern over the decrease in minority admissions in California following the ban on race-based considerations. However, she does not advocate for traditional affirmative action policies unconditionally, instead she praises the Texas '10 percent plan' as a more inclusive and effective alternative. Guinier's recognition of the limitations of traditional affirmative action policies and her appreciation for innovative approaches suggest that she is in favor of affirmative action but also believes in the need for evolving its implementation to better address educational disparities and diversity.	"Summary:
Lani Guinier discusses the contrasting outcomes of affirmative action policies in California and Texas. In California, the ban on considering race and ethnicity in public college admissions led to a significant decrease in the admission of black, Hispanic, and American Indian students at top universities, raising concerns about the resegregation of higher education. In contrast, Texas, after a Federal court banned the consideration of race in admissions, adopted the ""10 percent plan,"" which automatically admits students in the top 10 percent of their high school class to the state's most selective public schools, irrespective of their S.A.T. scores. This policy increased enrollment of black and Mexican-American students and also benefited white students from rural areas who typically underperformed on the S.A.T. Texas also implemented measures to improve primary education and accountability, leading to impressive educational achievements among students of various ethnic and economic backgrounds. Guinier suggests that Texas's approach promotes a more inclusive and productive discussion about education and diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Lani Guinier appears to be supportive of affirmative action as a means to achieve diversity and equality in education. However, she also acknowledges the limitations and challenges that come with traditional affirmative action policies, as seen in California. Guinier highlights the innovative approach taken by Texas with the 10 percent plan as a more inclusive and effective alternative. The author appreciates the Texas model, which not only maintains diversity in higher education but also addresses educational disparities at the primary level. Guinier's perspective suggests that while affirmative action is important, it is also necessary to find new ways to foster diversity and equality that can gain broader support and address the root causes of educational inequity."	0.026959999999999998	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Henry Louis Gates Jr., does not directly address affirmative action in the provided summary. However, he acknowledges the historical significance of literacy and education for African Americans and the progress made since the civil rights movement, which includes the growth of the black middle class, partly attributed to affirmative action programs. Gates focuses on the digital divide as a modern barrier to equality and emphasizes the need for community engagement and technological access to overcome this challenge. While he does not explicitly state his stance on affirmative action, his emphasis on the importance of continued efforts to address inequality suggests that he recognizes the value of such programs but also sees them as part of a larger set of solutions required to tackle current issues.	"Summary:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical struggle for literacy among African Americans, starting from the prohibition of reading and writing after the Stono Rebellion in 1739. He emphasizes the importance of literacy as a means of liberation and connection to culture and history, a theme prevalent in slave narratives. Gates points out that despite progress since the civil rights movement, a new form of segregation is emerging: the digital divide. He cites a Commerce Department study showing that African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to own computers or use the internet than whites, a gap that cannot be fully explained by income differences.

Gates argues that the digital divide threatens to disenfranchise a significant portion of the population and that it is crucial for African American children to have access to technology for education and cultural context. He draws parallels between historical segregation and current disconnectedness, including the isolation of middle-class black professionals and the lack of role models for children in the underclass. Gates suggests that creating internet content that appeals to African Americans could help bridge the digital divide, similar to how race records in the 1920s attracted black audiences to the recording industry.

He concludes by calling on the African American community to address this issue by utilizing community centers and churches for after-school programs focused on technology and black history. Gates warns that if African Americans do not embrace information technology, they risk self-imposed cybersegregation as limiting as past enforced segregation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action, it does reference the growth of the black middle class since the inception of affirmative action programs in the late 1960s. Gates highlights the positive impact of these programs in creating opportunities for African Americans. However, he also notes the new challenges that have arisen, such as the digital divide and the social and cultural isolation experienced by some middle-class black professionals. From this, we can infer that Gates views affirmative action as a beneficial but incomplete solution to broader issues of inequality and disconnectedness within the African American community. He seems to advocate for continued efforts to address these challenges, including leveraging technology and community resources to foster connections and opportunities."	0.03493	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author does not directly express their own view on affirmative action, but the text provides contextual cues that indicate a negative portrayal of the anti-affirmative action rally led by Richard Barrett. By contrasting Barrett's white supremacist views and the divisive nature of his rally with the town's celebration of diversity and unity, the author implicitly suggests a preference for the latter. The positive depiction of the town's inclusive response and the negative portrayal of Barrett's protest suggest that the author may be in favor of the principles behind affirmative action, which aim to promote diversity and equal opportunity. However, without an explicit statement from the author, it is not possible to definitively categorize their stance as 'strongly in favor' or 'somewhat in favor.'	"Summary:
Morristown, known for its historical significance during the Revolutionary War, faced a contemporary challenge when a white supremacist, Richard Barrett, held a rally to protest affirmative action and promote white supremacy. Barrett, from Mississippi and leader of the Nationalist Movement, selected Morristown due to its historical context, comparing his rally against minority privileges to George Washington's rebellion against the privileges of the king. The event was met with a strong police presence, counter-protests, and resulted in arrests and conflicts.

In contrast, the town responded with a celebration of diversity at the Calvary Baptist Church, attended by about 1,000 people, including various religious and ethnic communities. The event was peaceful, focusing on unity and rejecting notions of racial superiority. The Mayor of Morristown, John J. DeLaney Jr., encouraged this event as a positive counter to Barrett's divisive message without directly confronting it. The town's racial tensions were acknowledged, referencing a recent incident of a black resident killed by police, which some saw as racial profiling.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal stance on affirmative action in the text. However, they portray affirmative action negatively through the character of Richard Barrett, who is described as a white supremacist seeking to protest what he calls ""the privileges of minorities."" The author contrasts Barrett's divisive and racist stance with the town's celebration of diversity, suggesting a preference for unity and equality over Barrett's ideology. The community's response, which includes a multi-faith and multi-ethnic gathering to celebrate diversity, implies that the author views the town's inclusive approach more favorably than Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance. The overall tone of the article suggests that the author supports the town's rejection of racial superiority and its efforts to promote harmony among its diverse population."	0.03097	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to view affirmative action through a positive lens, as evidenced by the praise given to Dr. Formicola for his work in increasing minority enrollment and expanding access to quality dental care in historically underserved areas. The text describes Dr. Formicola's initiatives as an embodiment of affirmative action's goals and ideals, suggesting that such efforts can lead to significant improvements in community relations and access to services. The author's focus on the broader implications of Dr. Formicola's work for addressing inequality and the underrepresentation of black dentists in the field indicates a belief in the value and efficacy of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the positive impact of Dr. Allan J. Formicola, who is retiring as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery after 23 years. Dr. Formicola has been instrumental in increasing minority enrollment at the dental school and expanding access to quality dental care in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. Despite the strained history between Columbia University and surrounding neighborhoods, Dr. Formicola has been successful in building community relations and establishing health centers and dental clinics. His efforts have also addressed the broader issues of affirmative action and inequality, demonstrating what those in power can do to help underserved communities. The article highlights the challenges that remain in the field of dentistry, particularly the underrepresentation of black dentists and the lack of specialized dental practitioners in Harlem. There is hope that Columbia will continue Dr. Formicola's legacy after his retirement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action in a positive light, using Dr. Formicola's work as an example of its potential benefits. Dr. Formicola's efforts to recruit minority students and faculty and to provide services to minority neighborhoods are seen as a practical application of affirmative action principles. The author implies that affirmative action is not just about quotas or numbers but about meaningful engagement and support for communities that have been historically marginalized. The text suggests that affirmative action can lead to tangible improvements in access to essential services, such as healthcare, and can help bridge the gap between institutions of power and the communities they serve. The author's perspective is that affirmative action, when implemented thoughtfully and with a genuine commitment to equality, can be a powerful tool for social change."	0.028709999999999996	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author, Frank Rich, seems to critique the superficial support for affirmative action by certain politicians, particularly in the context of Trent Lott's scandal. Rich suggests that Lott's sudden advocacy for affirmative action is disingenuous, and he also criticizes the Republican Party's ineffective and PR-driven approach to racial equality policies. The author's focus is on the misuse and insincere support of affirmative action rather than on the policy itself. Therefore, it is difficult to categorize Rich's stance on affirmative action as for or against since his main concern is the authenticity of politicians' support for the policy.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on the political fallout following Trent Lott's controversial remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, where he seemed to support Thurmond's segregationist past. The author, Frank Rich, argues that Lott's attempt to recover his political standing by embracing affirmative action and other left-leaning positions is disingenuous. Rich points out the media and political leaders' hypocrisy for not addressing Lott's association with the racist Council of Conservative Citizens earlier. He also notes that Lott's behavior is not an anomaly within the Republican Party, citing instances of racially insensitive actions by other party members, including the Attorney General John Ashcroft. Rich discusses the party's use of race in politics and criticizes President Bush's ""affirmative access"" and ""compassionate conservatism"" as ineffective and mere public relations strategies. The text ends with a note of sympathy for Lott, suggesting he is a scapegoat for broader issues within the Republican Party.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Frank Rich, appears to view affirmative action as a policy that should be genuinely pursued rather than used as a political tool for damage control. Rich implies that Lott's sudden support for ""across the board"" affirmative action is insincere and a desperate attempt to regain favor after his racially insensitive remarks. The author's perspective suggests a criticism of the way affirmative action is sometimes co-opted by politicians who do not have a history of supporting such measures and who may, in fact, have previously aligned themselves with racist organizations or sentiments. Rich's broader critique of the Republican Party's handling of race issues implies that affirmative action, among other policies aimed at racial equality, should be addressed with sincerity and commitment rather than as a superficial public relations maneuver."	0.03939	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	James O. Freedman's support for affirmative action is evident through his direct involvement in preparing a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court to support the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. His belief that the education of minority men and women is crucial for America's future highlights his commitment to the goals of affirmative action, such as creating opportunities for underrepresented groups and promoting diversity in academia. His advocacy for civil discourse and combating bigotry on campus further reinforces his strong endorsement of policies that advance social justice and equality.	"Summary:
James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth, is an ardent defender of liberal education, which he believes is crucial for developing personal understanding, a moral compass, and an appreciation of how society and democracies function. Despite facing criticism that liberal arts are impractical, Freedman argues in his book ""Liberal Education and the Public Interest"" that such an education provides critical thinking and writing skills that are highly valued in the job market. Battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Freedman remains focused on promoting liberal values and has recently supported affirmative action through his work with the American Jewish Committee. He has a history of fostering diversity and tolerance at Dartmouth, combating bigotry on campus, and advocating for civil discourse. Now living in Cambridge with his wife and surrounded by his book collection, Freedman continues to engage in intellectual discussions and offer guidance in academia.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
James O. Freedman is a strong proponent of affirmative action, as evidenced by his involvement in preparing a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. He believes that the future of America relies on the education of minority men and women, indicating that he sees affirmative action as a necessary tool for creating educational opportunities for underrepresented groups and fostering a diverse academic environment.

3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as evidenced by the portrayal of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's potential sympathy towards the principle of affirmative action. The author highlights O'Connor's personal experiences with gender discrimination and suggests that her understanding of the practical consequences of legal decisions might influence her to support the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies. Additionally, the author draws a parallel between O'Connor's appointment to the Supreme Court and affirmative action, implying that O'Connor might see merit in such policies. The overall tone of the text suggests a nuanced view that recognizes the complexity of O'Connor's position but leans towards a favorable view of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses a pivotal moment in the U.S. Supreme Court where Kirk Kolbo, representing the plaintiffs against the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies, is challenged by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, known for being a swing vote on the court, questions the absoluteness of Kolbo's argument against the use of race in college admissions. The article provides a background on Justice O'Connor's life, her career as a lawyer and judge, and her track record on the Supreme Court, highlighting her conservative stance but also her occasional breaks with conservative ideology. It speculates on how she might rule on the affirmative action cases before the court, given her history and the questions she raised during the oral arguments.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Justice O'Connor as someone who may be sympathetic to the principle of affirmative action, despite her conservative history. O'Connor's own experiences with gender discrimination and her recognition of the real-world impacts of policies suggest she might side with the University of Michigan. The author emphasizes O'Connor's tendency to consider the practical consequences of legal decisions and her reluctance to overturn established precedents, like the Bakke decision, which allowed for race to be considered in admissions. The text also hints at a personal connection for O'Connor, as her appointment to the Supreme Court by President Reagan could be seen as a form of affirmative action. Therefore, the author suggests that O'Connor might view the university's affirmative action policy as a parallel to her own experiences and ultimately rule in favor of upholding it."	0.0296	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text exhibits a nuanced view on affirmative action. They recognize the value of diversity and the importance of providing opportunities to underrepresented groups, suggesting a belief in the principles behind affirmative action. However, they also acknowledge that in the case of Jayson Blair, the push for diversity may have led to a lapse in journalistic standards, indicating an awareness of the potential drawbacks of affirmative action when not carefully managed. The author does not outright condemn or fully endorse affirmative action, instead advocating for a balanced approach that maintains integrity while striving for diversity.	"Summary:
The text is an email from a columnist at The New York Times, discussing the scandal involving Jayson Blair, a reporter who committed journalistic fraud through plagiarism and fabricating stories. The scandal is described as a “low point” in the newspaper's history and a “huge black eye.” The columnist acknowledges the system's failure, partly attributing it to the desire to see a young, ambitious black journalist succeed, which may have led to him being given too many chances despite numerous warnings and corrections. The executive editor, Howell Raines, is focused on transparency and fixing communication issues within the editorial team. The columnist also touches on the reactions in Washington, noting the political schadenfreude from both liberals and conservatives. The author defends The Times' editorial independence and commitment to truth, and suggests that diversity is still a valuable goal, despite the Blair incident. The columnist concludes by urging the newspaper to learn from the incident and continue to be an example for journalists worldwide.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. While acknowledging that Jayson Blair's case has been seized upon by critics as an example of the pitfalls of affirmative action, the author defends the principle of providing opportunities to underrepresented groups, such as black, Hispanic, and Asian journalists. The author implies that diversity is beneficial and necessary for the media world and that The New York Times has the right to support it if it chooses to do so. However, the author also seems to suggest that in this instance, the desire to promote diversity may have contributed to overlooking Blair's professional shortcomings. Despite this, the author does not reject the concept of affirmative action outright but rather seems to advocate for its careful implementation, ensuring that it does not compromise journalistic integrity or standards."	0.02855	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to take a neutral stance on affirmative action. They present multiple perspectives on the issue, acknowledging the arguments and concerns of both liberals and conservatives. The author discusses the complexity of educational disparities and the varying opinions on how to address them, including the role of affirmative action. They highlight the benefits and limitations of affirmative action without expressing a clear preference for or against it. The author's focus on the need for societal commitment to address educational disparities suggests a recognition of the issue's importance but does not indicate a strong stance on affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in university admissions included an expectation from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that racial preferences would not be necessary in 25 years. This statement has sparked questions about the future of affirmative action and the measures needed to eliminate educational disparities. Justice O'Connor, in a rare interview, expressed optimism that progress in education could eliminate the need for affirmative action. However, statistics show persistent gaps in academic success indicators between white and minority students. Discussions about how to close these gaps involve considerations of school financing, social inequality, and student study habits.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author presents a balanced view of the debate surrounding affirmative action, recognizing the complexities and challenges involved in addressing educational disparities. They acknowledge the perspectives of both liberals, who argue for financial parity in education, and conservatives, who suggest that financial resources alone do not guarantee educational equality. The author notes that affirmative action tends to benefit middle-income students more than those from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds and that even middle-class minority students face challenges that perpetuate the test-score gap. The author conveys that while there is a consensus on the need to close the education gap, there is significant disagreement on the role of affirmative action and the strategies to achieve educational equity. The article suggests that unless there is a societal commitment to address these issues, the debate over affirmative action will likely continue beyond the 25-year timeframe mentioned by Justice O'Connor."	0.03739	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as indicated by their approval of the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Michigan's race-conscious admissions policy. They seem to appreciate the Court's moderate stance and its reflection of national consensus, suggesting that the author believes affirmative action is a balanced and mainstream approach to achieving diversity in higher education. While the author does not express a strong advocacy for affirmative action, their support for the Court's decision and concern over an extreme conservative tilt that might dismantle such policies indicates a favorable view towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions and its alignment with public opinion during a particular term. Despite expectations from conservative legal groups that the Court, with a majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents, would strike down affirmative action, it upheld the University of Michigan's race-conscious admissions policy in a 5-to-4 vote. Additionally, the Court ruled 6-to-3 that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected, overturning a previous decision and aligning with changing public sentiment on privacy and discrimination against gays. Furthermore, the Court paused its states' rights crusade, upholding federal protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act for state workers. However, the Court's moderation did not always extend to protecting the marginalized, as evidenced by its refusal to challenge California's ""three strikes"" law in a case involving a disproportionate sentence for a minor theft. The term's decisions highlight the ideological spectrum of the Court, with a far-right faction and a liberal-centrist group, but no equivalent left-wing push. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Court's moderate stance in future appointments, as a single extreme appointment could significantly impact American rights and policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a policy that aligns with a national consensus and believes that the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it reflects a moderate and mainstream approach to the law. They suggest that the Court's decision to endorse the consideration of race in university admissions, without the use of quotas or rigid formulas, is a balanced response that mirrors the prevailing attitudes of the American people. The author implies that the Court's moderation in this matter is preferable to the potential of having an extreme conservative tilt that might dismantle such policies."	0.027710000000000002	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's discussion of affirmative action is limited and does not provide a clear indication of their personal stance on the issue. The mention of affirmative action is used to illustrate the complexity of political positions rather than to advocate for or against the policy. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, contrasting the liberal presidential candidates with the moderate party leaders who are cautious about appearing too extreme. The author, Sam Tanenhaus, argues that Republicans have been successful by energizing their base and selecting candidates that resonate with their core supporters, while Democrats are concerned about repeating past electoral defeats attributed to far-left ideologies. Tanenhaus suggests that ideology may not be as crucial in presidential elections as the passion and energy of ideologues and extremists, drawing parallels with the Republican Party's experience in the 1964 election. He recounts how Barry Goldwater's perceived extremism ultimately laid the groundwork for a conservative resurgence and a shift in Republican strategy, leading to Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980. Tanenhaus concludes by noting the irony of the Republican Party's embrace of its populist activists while the Democratic establishment seems wary of its own base.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author briefly mentions affirmative action when discussing President Bush's political positions, noting that he appears to support ""some types of affirmative action."" This statement suggests that the author recognizes the complexity and nuance in political stances, where a politician can hold seemingly contradictory positions, such as being a small-government conservative who supports certain affirmative action policies. However, the text does not delve deeply into the author's personal views on affirmative action or its broader implications within the political landscape. The mention of affirmative action is used more to illustrate the point that politicians, and by extension political parties, often have multifaceted and sometimes inconsistent policy positions."	0.030119999999999997	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	Ian Haney Lopez demonstrates a clear understanding and support for the original intent behind landmark cases like Brown and Hernandez to combat systematic oppression and group subordination. He criticizes the current judicial approach that impedes affirmative action by treating all race-conscious government actions as inherently racist. Lopez argues for a distinction between race-conscious efforts to redress discrimination and laws that perpetuate racial subordination. His perspective is that affirmative action is a necessary tool to combat historical and systemic racism, indicating that he is in favor of affirmative action policies. Given his critique of the Supreme Court's stance and his support for the principles underlying Hernandez, it can be inferred that Lopez is not just slightly in favor but holds a strong conviction about the importance and legitimacy of affirmative action as a means to address racial inequality.	"Summary:
Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor, reflects on the 50th anniversary of two significant Supreme Court cases: Brown v. Board of Education and Hernandez v. Texas. While Brown is widely known for addressing racial segregation in schools, Hernandez, which preceded it by two weeks, is often overlooked. Hernandez extended constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans by focusing on the broader issue of group-based discrimination rather than race alone. This case set a precedent for protecting any socially defined group facing subordination. Lopez criticizes the contemporary interpretation of Brown, suggesting that it has been misconstrued to challenge all race-conscious government action, rather than addressing systematic oppression. He argues that the Supreme Court's current stance fails to address racism effectively when it is not explicit, citing an example of racial disparities in Georgia's death penalty. Lopez suggests that Hernandez, rather than Brown, should be at the forefront of constitutional antidiscrimination law, as it provides a clearer stance against racial subordination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ian Haney Lopez views affirmative action through the lens of the original intent of cases like Brown and Hernandez, which aimed to combat systematic oppression and group subordination. He criticizes the current Supreme Court's interpretation, which equates all use of race in government action with racism, thereby creating significant obstacles for affirmative action policies. Lopez argues that this interpretation distorts the anti-caste commitment of Brown v. Board of Education, leading to a constitutional framework that opposes race-conscious efforts to address discrimination and inequality. He believes that affirmative action, when used to distribute benefits based on race, is fundamentally different from laws designed to subjugate a race. Lopez contends that affirmative action should be understood as a tool to combat the lingering effects of historical and systemic racism, rather than being seen as equivalent to the racial discrimination it seeks to ameliorate."	0.03282	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's personal perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary. The text is about a quiz that includes various political topics and mentions President Bush's position on affirmative action in the context of selecting Supreme Court justices. However, the summary does not provide any direct indication of the author's own stance on the issue.	"Summary:
This text appears to be a quiz or a set of trivia questions related to political events and figures, mainly focusing on President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry during a period of political campaigns, likely around the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The questions cover a range of topics including statements made by President Bush about Osama bin Laden, Senator Kerry's response to a report on President Bush's IQ, proposals to save Social Security, political advertisements, the disappearance of explosives from a site in Iraq, and celebrity political endorsements. It also touches on the criteria President Bush might use for selecting Supreme Court justices, his consultation with a ""higher father"" regarding the invasion of Iraq, campaign strategies in Ohio, and a comment by a Democratic politician on the Bush family's influence in Florida. Finally, it asks for the identification of Hans Blix.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
Based on question 11, the author of the quiz includes a statement about President Bush's position on a Supreme Court justice. The answer to the question indicates that President Bush would find a pro-affirmative action stance unacceptable in a Supreme Court justice. This suggests that the author is aware of President Bush's perspective on affirmative action, which is not supportive, at least in the context of judicial appointments. However, the quiz itself does not provide an in-depth analysis of the author's personal perspective on affirmative action; it merely presents it as a factual point related to President Bush's criteria for a Supreme Court justice."	0.030760000000000003	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author seems to approach the topic of affirmative action by portraying it as a divisive issue within the context of Harvard University. They reference the institution's historical support for such measures, as well as the contrasting stance of Lawrence Summers, who appears less inclined to follow affirmative action principles. The author's discussion of the topic is more descriptive of the situation at Harvard rather than advocating for or against affirmative action directly. They highlight the tension between liberal and conservative views on the subject within the university. The author's own perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, and they do not seem to take a definitive stance on whether they believe it is beneficial or detrimental. Instead, they focus on how the issue is reflective of broader societal debates and the changes facing Harvard.	"Summary:
The article discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, then-president of Harvard University, after he suggested that men may have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude. The incident sparked protests and debates about Harvard's identity as a liberal or conservative institution. The discussion extends to various issues such as affirmative action, campus expansion, and faculty power. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is seen as a conservative figure within the university context, despite his political background. He has been involved in confrontations, such as with Cornel West and on the topic of grade inflation. The article also touches on Harvard's endowment and accusations of corporatization due to its real estate acquisitions. The author suggests that the real issue is not Summers' presidency but how Harvard will navigate significant changes in the coming years.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action as a contentious issue at Harvard, with liberals advocating for its use to address the low number of tenured women professors and conservatives attributing the gender disparity to different career trajectories. The author references Derek Bok, a previous Harvard president, as a proponent of affirmative action, suggesting that the institution has historically supported such measures. However, Lawrence Summers' presidency is characterized by a departure from this stance, as indicated by his confrontations and the perspective of his critics, who label him as not in favor of affirmative action. The author implies that Summers' approach to hiring, wanting to hire who he pleases without regard to race or sex, contrasts with affirmative action principles. Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action is a divisive and politicized issue within Harvard, reflective of broader societal debates."	0.03432	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt	3
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text seems to view affirmative action critically, especially in the context of John McCain, who is described as an 'affirmative action scion of admirals.' This implies that McCain may have benefited from family connections rather than personal merit. In contrast, the author praises Obama for not disclosing his race on his Harvard Law School application, suggesting a belief that Obama's accomplishments are based on merit alone. The comparison indicates that the author could be against affirmative action when it is perceived as giving unearned advantages, as they seem to favor a merit-based system, as exemplified by Obama's achievements.	"Summary:
The text discusses the apparent envy that several political figures, including Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson, and John McCain, have toward Barack Obama's rise to prominence. Bill Clinton is criticized for not being sincere and for engaging in subtle racial politics. Jesse Jackson's civil rights strategy is framed as manipulating white guilt, now seen as outdated with Obama's approach. John McCain is portrayed as abandoning his principles and engaging in a petty campaign, focusing on trivial attacks instead of substantial issues. McCain's transformation is seen as a betrayal by some of his Senate colleagues, and his envy is suggested to stem from Obama's cool, intellectual image that contrasts with McCain's self-image as a maverick. McCain's campaign has become more aggressive under his strategist Steve Schmidt, moving away from the ""Straight Talk"" approach he was known for.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, at least in the context of John McCain. The text implies that McCain is an ""affirmative action scion of admirals,"" suggesting that he may have benefited from his family legacy rather than merit to get through Annapolis. This contrasts with Obama, who, according to the text, did not even disclose his race on his Harvard Law School application, implying that Obama's achievements are solely based on merit. Therefore, the author appears to view affirmative action negatively in McCain's case, as it may have given him unearned advantages, while highlighting Obama's success as self-made and not reliant on such policies."	0.02818	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appreciates affirmative action for its role in creating opportunities for minorities, as evidenced by the success stories of prominent figures and her own personal experience. While recognizing its benefits, she also discusses the complexities and challenges that come with it, such as the internal conflicts and societal issues that remain unresolved. Her perspective is nuanced, acknowledging both the positive aspects and the limitations of affirmative action. This suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action, but with an understanding of its intricacies and the need for further progress in racial equality.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the impact of affirmative action policies that began in 1969 when prestigious U.S. universities started actively recruiting black and Latino students. This initiative aimed to make these institutions more representative of the nation's demographics in response to the civil rights movement. Notable figures such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett are cited as part of a new elite whose success was facilitated by these policies. The author, Helene Cooper, shares her personal experience as a beneficiary of affirmative action, acknowledging both the opportunities it provided and the self-doubt it sometimes engendered. The text also discusses the complexities and dual consciousness experienced by minority students from this era, balancing their ethnic identities with the cultural assimilation into traditionally white academic environments. The arrest of Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., and President Obama's response, is highlighted as an example of the ongoing challenges faced by even the most successful African Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a positive but complex policy. She acknowledges that it has helped create a more diverse elite in America, allowing individuals like herself and President Obama to attend prestigious universities and succeed in their careers. However, she also recognizes the internal conflicts and societal challenges that come with it. The author suggests that affirmative action beneficiaries often feel a sense of ""double consciousness,"" having to navigate between their ethnic background and the predominantly white world of elite academia. Despite the opportunities affirmative action has provided, the author notes that it does not shield one from racial prejudices and stereotypes, as seen in the incident involving Professor Gates and the subsequent remarks by President Obama. Overall, the author presents affirmative action as a necessary but not entirely sufficient step toward racial equality, implying that there is still much work to be done to address the deeper issues of race in America."	0.03658	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, based on the positive portrayal of Goodwin Liu's support for the policy and the suggestion that his views are within the mainstream. While the focus of the text is on the political process of judicial nominations rather than on affirmative action itself, the author's support for Liu and criticism of the Republican opposition to his nomination suggest a favorable stance towards affirmative action. However, since the text does not explicitly advocate for affirmative action, but rather supports a nominee who does, the author's stance is characterized as 'somewhat in favor' rather than 'strongly in favor'.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to reconsider nominees for federal judgeships, including Goodwin Liu, due to Republican obstruction. Republicans refused to allow a full Senate vote on the nominees and invoked a rule requiring re-nomination. Liu is a well-qualified candidate with a strong educational background and diverse legal views. Despite conservative opposition to his views on issues like same-sex marriage and affirmative action, he has been praised for his openness and independence, even by conservative figures like Kenneth Starr. The author urges Republican committee members to support the nominees and encourages Democrats to continue pushing for their confirmation. The author notes that the confirmation rate for President Obama's nominees is lower than it was for President Bush at the same point in his presidency, attributing the delay to Republican actions rather than the qualifications of the nominees.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to support affirmative action, as they describe Goodwin Liu's backing of affirmative action as falling ""well within the legal and political mainstream."" The author appears to view affirmative action as one of several progressive legal positions that Liu holds, which the Republicans oppose. However, the author suggests that conservative resistance to Liu's nomination is not based on his views being extreme but rather on political maneuvering and perhaps an attempt to prevent a potential future Supreme Court nominee from joining the bench. The author's perspective is that Liu's views, including his support for affirmative action, should not disqualify him from serving as a federal judge."	0.02271	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text deals with Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the sexual harassment allegations made by Anita Hill, and the subsequent developments involving Thomas's wife and a former girlfriend. While the author does mention Clarence Thomas's views on affirmative action, suggesting that Thomas believes it might harm those it is supposed to help, the author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action. The reference to Thomas's views on the policy appears to be more of a contextual detail within the broader narrative of his experiences and the controversy surrounding him, rather than an endorsement or critique of affirmative action by the author themselves. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clear from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the controversy surrounding the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, during which Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment. The author expresses skepticism about the timing and significance of Hill's allegations, suggesting that they were not as scandalous as they were made out to be. The article also discusses the recent actions of Thomas's wife, Ginni, who left a voicemail for Hill asking for an apology, and the emergence of Lillian McEwen, a former girlfriend of Thomas, who has spoken out to corroborate Hill's testimony while promoting her memoir. The author mentions Thomas's personal struggles and transformation as detailed in his memoir and suggests that the renewed attention on the allegations is akin to a ""second lynching"" for Thomas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a critical view of affirmative action by mentioning Clarence Thomas's belief that it might ultimately harm those it intends to help. The author seems to suggest that the real ""offense"" of Thomas was not the alleged harassment but his conservative stance on issues like affirmative action as a black man. The text indicates that the author may share Thomas's skepticism about the efficacy or fairness of affirmative action policies."	0.02561	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The focus of the text is on the political and judicial implications of Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court rather than on specific policy issues like affirmative action. While the author mentions Bork's problematic view of affirmative action rulings, there is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on the matter. The reference to Bork's views suggests that the author might have reservations about affirmative action policies but this is not sufficient to categorize the author's stance definitively.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the rejection of Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination 24 years prior to the date of the article. Bork was a highly qualified candidate with a strong conservative background, advocating for original intent and judicial restraint. His views on Roe v. Wade, affirmative action, and the First Amendment were not considered extreme, and he was respected for his intellectual capacity. The article suggests that the tactics used by Democrats to block Bork's nomination marked the beginning of the end of civil discourse in American politics, leading to an era of obstructionism and hostility between the two major political parties. The author argues that the Democrats' portrayal of Bork as an extremist was unfair and that this strategy has had lasting negative consequences for the political climate and the judicial nomination process.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly provide a personal perspective on affirmative action but does mention Bork's view that the Supreme Court's rulings on affirmative action were problematic. The author's focus is more on the broader political and judicial implications of Bork's nomination rather than on specific policy issues. However, the reference to Bork's criticism of affirmative action rulings suggests that the author may view such policies as contentious and possibly sees merit in Bork's originalist and restrained approach to constitutional interpretation."	0.02597	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the letters express varying degrees of support for affirmative action. Mallory Duncan supports affirmative action as a corrective measure to historical biases and to promote diversity. Michael Farzan advocates for an inclusive approach to affirmative action that considers economic status, indicating support but with a suggestion for improvement. Tom O'Hare's stance is less clear, as he calls for equality without condescension, which might suggest some reservation about affirmative action's current implementation. Tom Barnard criticizes the administration's inconsistent approach to diversity, implying support for maintaining affirmative action in terms of racial diversity. Overall, the authors seem to be in favor of affirmative action but with differing views on its execution.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor address the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize race in college admissions. The first letter argues that prestigious colleges have historically given preferential treatment to legacies, athletes, and those from certain geographic areas, which has benefited mostly white students. The writer suggests that shifting some of this preference towards students of color and the economically disadvantaged was an attempt to create diversity and redress biases. The second letter criticizes President Trump for appealing to white resentment and suggests that affirmative action should also consider economic status. The third letter argues for treating African-Americans and Latinos as equals without condescension, while the fourth questions why the administration targets racial diversity but not gender diversity, noting that men are often admitted with lower scores for gender balance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors of the letters generally support affirmative action, though they have different perspectives on its implementation and focus. Mallory Duncan views affirmative action as a necessary correction to historical biases and a means to achieve diversity in higher education. Michael Farzan suggests that affirmative action should include economic status to address social mobility issues more effectively. Tom O'Hare believes in equality and potential without racial condescension, implying that affirmative action may not be the best method to achieve this. Tom Barnard points out the inconsistency in the administration's stance on diversity, highlighting that gender diversity is seemingly acceptable while racial diversity is not, which suggests a belief in the importance of maintaining diversity in admissions policies. Overall, the authors advocate for the continuation of affirmative action but also call for a more nuanced and equitable approach to its application."	0.02503	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt	3
4	strongly_in_favor	Ibert Schultz, as described in the summary, is deeply concerned about the negative impact that the ban on affirmative action has on students of color, particularly Black students. His work with Black College Success is aimed at mitigating the effects of such policies by providing personalized support and resources to Black students. Schultz's reference to the drop in Black student enrollment following California's Proposition 209, his concern over 'colorblind' admissions, and his emphasis on the need for academic readiness and guidance indicate that he sees affirmative action as a critical component of ensuring equitable access to higher education for underrepresented groups. Therefore, Schultz's perspective can be categorized as strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to ban affirmative action on college admissions, emphasizing the challenges it presents to students of color. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit aiding Black students in South Los Angeles to access higher education. Schultz references California's Proposition 209, which led to a significant drop in Black student enrollment at state schools. He highlights the struggles faced by Black students in Los Angeles, such as low college enrollment and graduation rates, and the socioeconomic barriers they encounter. Despite these challenges, Black College Success has successfully helped many students gain admission to various colleges and universities. Schultz outlines the organization's approach, which includes personalized support, academic planning, mentoring, and assistance with college applications and financial aid. He stresses that a combination of academic readiness, guidance, and personal determination is key to student success. Schultz expresses concern that the move towards ""colorblind"" admissions will reduce opportunities for Black students and have broader negative implications for society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ibert Schultz, views affirmative action as a necessary tool to help level the playing field for students of color, particularly Black students. He sees the ban on affirmative action as a step back, potentially leading to reduced opportunities for these students in higher education. Schultz believes that without considering the unique experiences and challenges faced by Black applicants, colleges and universities will fail to provide equitable access to education, which will be detrimental not only to the students themselves but also to society as a whole. His work with Black College Success reflects a commitment to providing the kind of support and resources that affirmative action aimed to ensure, demonstrating his belief in the value of such policies for achieving racial equity in education."	0.03034	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt	3
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action. They recognize the divisive nature of the policy but ultimately see it as a necessary measure to address historical discrimination and to ensure equal opportunities. By citing the military's approach and referencing General Colin Powell's balanced views, the author advocates for a nuanced application of affirmative action that is temporary and aims to level the playing field without diminishing individual achievements. The author's support for President Clinton's initiative and the call for constructive dialogue further suggest a favorable view towards affirmative action, but the recognition of the need for inclusivity and balance in the conversation indicates a somewhat moderate stance rather than full-throated advocacy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges faced by President Clinton's initiative on race, including the rocky start and the political missteps of key figures involved. Despite these issues, the effort is considered commendable due to the complexity and importance of addressing racial issues in America. The White House is taking steps to control the advisory committee on race and is planning to introduce new proposals focused on youth. There is an acknowledgment of the need to include conservative voices in the conversation, and upcoming meetings with conservative figures are mentioned.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They acknowledge the divisive nature of affirmative action in American society, with public opinion varying based on whether affirmative action is perceived as quotas and rigid preferences or as a means to ensure equal opportunities. The author provides examples of how affirmative action has been implemented, such as in the military, where goals are set to achieve a certain composition of African-American cadets at West Point. The author argues that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for historical discrimination and to level the playing field, citing the military's use of preparatory programs to help African-American candidates meet standards as an example of such actions.

The author also references General Colin Powell's views on affirmative action, noting his balanced approach that recognizes the need for temporary measures to address past discrimination while also cautioning against preferential treatment that diminishes achievements. The author stresses the importance of moving beyond inflammatory rhetoric and engaging in a constructive dialogue about preferences and discrimination.

In conclusion, the author supports President Clinton's initiative on race and the use of affirmative action as a tool to foster equality, while also calling for a more inclusive and less divisive discussion on the subject."	0.03189	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt	3
2	neutral	The author's discussion focuses on the evolution of public interest in various political issues, including affirmative action. However, the author does not provide a personal opinion or analysis of affirmative action's merits or drawbacks. Instead, the author simply observes that affirmative action, like other issues, has seen a decline in public concern following legislative action. The lack of a clear personal stance on the policy itself suggests that the author is reporting on the phenomenon of shifting public interest rather than advocating for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the shifting focus of California voters from education to other issues such as health care and infrastructure. Governor Gray Davis, who emphasized education reform, may find that the issue loses its potency as voters begin to believe that the problem is being addressed following the passage of reform proposals and increased federal funding. Pollster Steve Kinney predicts that as education concerns wane, health care and infrastructure will become more prominent, especially if the economy continues to thrive. However, if there's an economic downturn, voters may shift their attention back to taxes, crime, and jobs. Kinney uses a unique polling method, focusing on the intensity of concern by counting only the respondents who rate an issue a ""10"" on a scale of personal importance. The text also mentions that California ranks poorly in fourth-grade reading skills, another issue that Davis' administration needs to address. Additionally, the text notes that other Democratic leaders, such as Antonio Villaraigosa and John Burton, are already taking the lead on health care and transportation issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that affirmative action, much like illegal immigration and crime, was a hot issue that cooled down after the passage of Proposition 209, which effectively ended affirmative action in public institutions in California. The perspective presented is that once voters feel that an issue has been sufficiently addressed or solved through legislative or electoral means, they tend to move on to other emerging concerns. The author does not explicitly state a personal stance on affirmative action but indicates that it followed a trend where public interest declined after policy action was taken."	0.02774	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	3

3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Clarence Page, does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in depth, but his comments suggest a favorable view of diversity and the benefits it brings to society. He criticizes Goldberg's sarcastic remark about the NBA, which implies a recognition of the importance of creating opportunities for diverse individuals. Although affirmative action is not the central topic, Page's perspective on diversity and the value of a 'mulligan stew of ethnics' indicates that he would likely be somewhat in favor of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
Clarence Page critiques Jonah Goldberg's book ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" where Goldberg challenges political cliches he believes are often used by liberals instead of original thought. Page acknowledges that some cliches are outdated or problematic but also finds value in the succinct truths they can hold. He takes issue with Goldberg's dismissal of certain phrases, such as ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer,"" by highlighting the real-world implications of wrongful convictions. Page also disagrees with Goldberg's view on diversity and the dismissive approach to the phrase ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Additionally, Page lists cliches commonly used by conservatives, suggesting that the use of cliches is not limited to one political side.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Clarence Page does not delve deeply into the affirmative action debate in this particular text; however, he seems to support the notion that diversity has been a strength for the United States. He references the country's history of prospering from its ""mulligan stew of ethnics"" and the general ability of people to work together despite their differences. This suggests that Page likely views affirmative action policies that promote diversity as positive, recognizing the benefits they bring to society. His criticism of Goldberg's sarcastic remark about the NBA having quotas for ""midgets and one-legged point guards"" implies that Page sees value in efforts to create opportunities for a diverse range of individuals."	0.02647	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly towards the manner in which it is implemented within academic institutions. The criticism is aimed at the emphasis on superficial or tenuous ethnic connections to fulfill diversity quotas, rather than on substantial diversity of experiences and perspectives. The author is concerned that affirmative action benefits certain groups over others and that diversity is often only skin-deep, lacking in political and religious variety. The case of Elizabeth Warren is used to illustrate the flaws in the current system. The author's stance suggests a belief that affirmative action, as it is practiced, may not effectively address the intended goals of genuine diversity and equality of opportunity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority, specifically Native American, during her time as a law professor. Warren had cited family lore about high cheekbones and a Native American heritage, which she mentioned in a speech. However, the New England Genealogical Society found no evidence of her claimed Cherokee ancestry. This claim had previously been used by Harvard Law School to showcase its faculty diversity, but has since become a point of contention in Warren's political career. The author reflects on a personal anecdote about believing in a Native American ancestry based on family stories, only to find no such connection upon researching his great-grandfather's autobiography.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author criticizes the academic culture that emphasizes distant and tenuous ethnic connections to fulfill diversity quotas, rather than fostering genuine diversity of experiences and perspectives. The author argues that affirmative action programs sometimes benefit groups, such as West Indian immigrants, over others, like descendants of slaves, and that faculties may be diverse in skin tone but not in political and religious views. The case of Elizabeth Warren is seen as a flawed instance of such diversity efforts, where her supposed Native American ancestry was highlighted instead of her more relevant working-class background. The author suggests that the pursuit of superficial diversity, based on fractional ethnic heritage, is not a serious approach and will become increasingly untenable in a diverse America. The Warren incident is viewed as an opportunity for academic institutions to reconsider their approach to diversity and affirmative action."	0.02803	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Drew Westen, does not directly address his stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. The summary focuses on Westen's critique of the lack of vision in American presidential politics and the influence of Reagan's ideology on both parties. While it mentions Reagan's negative approach to affirmative action, it does not explicitly state Westen's personal views on the policy itself. Therefore, it is not possible to determine Westen's stance on affirmative action based solely on the information given in the summary.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the importance of having a clear vision in American presidential politics, drawing a historical line from Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural address during the Great Depression to the lack of a compelling vision in the 2012 presidential race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. The author, Drew Westen, criticizes both parties for failing to present a resonant vision to the American electorate. He notes that while Republicans continue to espouse a Reagan-era philosophy of small government and fiscal responsibility, their promises are seen as hollow given the past increases in national debt under Republican administrations. Meanwhile, Obama's message is seen as unclear, advocating for stimulus while also proposing significant budget cuts. The text argues that the influence of money in politics and historical shifts since Roosevelt's time have led to a situation where bold, transformative policies are less conceivable. Reagan's legacy, particularly, is said to have undone many New Deal advances and introduced an era of deregulation and inequality. Westen suggests that the current political landscape is still overshadowed by Reagan's ideology, which neither Romney nor Obama has effectively challenged.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Drew Westen, expresses a critical view of the Reagan administration's approach to affirmative action. He describes Reagan's messaging as having a racial component, with the use of terms like ""welfare queens"" to stoke racial tensions and appeal to white working-class males who felt threatened by affirmative action and the social changes of the 1960s. Westen implies that Reagan's policies and rhetoric contributed to a backlash against affirmative action, which was part of a broader critique of government intervention and a push for deregulation. This perspective suggests that the author views affirmative action as a positive force for social change that was undermined by Reagan's strategies, which played on fears and racial divisions."	0.03215	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author criticizes affirmative action policies as discriminatory and paradoxical, suggesting that they are counterproductive and undermine fundamental American principles. The metaphor of 'destroying a village in order to save it' indicates a strong opposition to the policy, as it implies affirmative action does more harm than good in the pursuit of diversity and equality.	"Summary:
The text is a letter to the editor expressing the author's opinion on affirmative action, specifically in the context of the Obama administration's stance urging the Supreme Court to permit universities to consider race as a factor in admissions. The author criticizes this policy, labeling it as euphemistic and obfuscatory, arguing that it essentially allows for racial discrimination under the guise of promoting diversity. He suggests that while the administration claims the goal is to ensure all segments of society have access to important careers regardless of race or ethnicity, the policy itself discriminates based on those very factors. The author concludes with a metaphor that affirmative action, as it is being advocated for, is akin to destroying a village in order to save it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, John S. Rosenberg, views affirmative action negatively. He believes that the policy, as supported by the Obama administration, contradicts fundamental American principles of treating individuals without regard to race. Rosenberg sees the policy as discriminatory, as it involves making decisions—specifically university admissions—based on race or ethnicity. He suggests that the administration's argument is paradoxical: it promotes discrimination in order to combat discrimination. The author's use of the phrase ""destroying the village in order to save it"" implies that he sees affirmative action as a self-defeating approach that causes harm in the name of pursuing a beneficial objective."	0.01792	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Jason L. Riley, seems to approach the topic of affirmative action with a level of skepticism, as evidenced by the language used to describe Chief Justice Roberts' 'aggressive' questioning and the inclusion of viewpoints that suggest affirmative action is at odds with 'true equality and ending discrimination.' The author's decision to present affirmative action as potentially discriminatory, without providing supporting arguments for its benefits, suggests a stance that is critical of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which deals with the issue of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white applicant, alleges that she was denied admission to the university because of her race, while the university maintains that it can consider race to foster a diverse student body. During the oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts, who had previously sided with the liberal wing of the Court in upholding the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), appeared to question the university's policies aggressively. He inquired about the definition of an ""acceptable"" number of minority students and whether there were implicit quotas. Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission both suggest that despite his vote on ObamaCare, Chief Justice Roberts is likely to side with Fisher in this case, based on his history of supporting ""true equality and ending discrimination.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jason L. Riley, seems to view affirmative action, specifically in the context of college admissions, with skepticism. This is evident through the portrayal of Chief Justice Roberts' questioning as ""aggressive,"" suggesting a critical stance towards the University of Texas's policies on race-based admissions. The author also implies that affirmative action may not align with ""true equality and ending discrimination,"" as indicated by Todd Gaziano's comments. Gaziano's perspective, which Riley includes without counterargument, suggests that affirmative action may, in fact, be a form of discrimination that Chief Justice Roberts is poised to oppose. Riley's choice to highlight these points implies that he may share a similar viewpoint, questioning the fairness and legality of affirmative action policies."	0.02222	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced, acknowledging both the historical importance of policies like the VRA in advancing minority rights and the potential drawbacks such policies may have in the current political climate. The author does not explicitly state a position for or against affirmative action, but rather discusses the complexities and dual outcomes of such policies. This suggests a more balanced view that recognizes the benefits of affirmative action in the past while also considering the need for policy evolution to address current challenges.	"Summary:
The text discusses the constitutionality and wisdom of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, particularly focusing on the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5, which mandates certain jurisdictions to have their election rules approved by the Justice Department to prevent discrimination. The author acknowledges the VRA's historical success in securing African American voting rights but points out its unintended consequences, such as increased political polarization and racial gerrymandering. The author notes that the act has arguably both a positive and limiting impact on African American political representation. Despite the fact that minority voters face fewer direct barriers to voting today, the author suggests that the VRA's pre-clearance provisions may no longer be congruent with current political realities. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the VRA is anticipated, and the author suggests that a ruling against pre-clearance might provoke a necessary debate on how to balance the protection of voting rights with the need to reinvigorate the political center.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author draws a parallel between affirmative action policies in universities and the creation of ""opportunity districts"" under the VRA, suggesting that both have played a role in building a middle class and a cadre of black elected officials post-segregation. However, the author also implies that there may be limitations to such policies, as they can lead to political segregation and limit the broader political influence and advancement of minority candidates. The author's perspective seems to acknowledge the historical importance and benefits of affirmative action while also pointing out its potential drawbacks in the context of contemporary politics and the evolving landscape of civil rights."	0.027110000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on the voting patterns and alignments of the Supreme Court justices, mentioning that Justice Ginsburg filed a lone dissent in an affirmative action case, which indicates her support for such policies, but does not provide enough information to determine the author's personal stance. The author appears to be reporting on the justices' positions and the nuances within the liberal wing of the court, rather than advocating for a particular viewpoint on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the voting patterns and alignments of the Supreme Court justices, focusing on the term that just concluded. It highlights that the three female justices—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—voted together at least 93 percent of the time, making them the most cohesive group on the court. Their alignment is attributed to their liberal ideologies rather than gender. The article also notes Justice Stephen G. Breyer's drift from his usual liberal allies in important privacy cases. The conservative justices displayed more fractured voting patterns compared to previous years.

Justice Sotomayor has been in the spotlight due to her memoir and media appearances, and she has become a source of inspiration for many, including lawyers who appear before the court. Justice Ginsburg, while also liberal, filed a lone dissent in an affirmative action case, showing that the votes of the three female justices are not entirely predictable. The article also mentions a friendly relationship between Justices Scalia and Kagan, as well as Scalia's hunting trip with Kagan and his friendship with Ginsburg.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides a factual account of the justices' positions on affirmative action without explicitly stating a personal perspective. However, by detailing the split between Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor on the issue, the author illustrates that even within the liberal wing of the court, there are nuanced views on affirmative action. Justice Ginsburg filed the lone dissent in a case challenging the University of Texas's affirmative action plan, which was sent back to the lower courts for a stricter review, indicating her support for affirmative action policies. Justice Sotomayor's position on the matter is not discussed in detail, but the fact that she did not join Ginsburg's dissent suggests a different viewpoint. The author seems to emphasize the complexity and diversity of opinions on the court regarding affirmative action, rather than promoting a singular perspective."	0.0335	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action. The text includes a discussion on race and the implications of a Supreme Court ruling in relation to affirmative action, but the author's stance is not clearly stated. The mention of societal issues that persist in the context of a debate on affirmative action suggests that the author acknowledges the complexities surrounding the topic. However, without explicit commentary supporting or opposing affirmative action, the author's perspective cannot be determined with certainty.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reaction of Lawrence Tolliver, a South Los Angeles barbershop owner, to the lifetime ban of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Sterling was banned due to racist remarks captured on an audiotape, where he scolded a female friend for associating with black people and instructed her not to bring them to his games. The incident occurred amidst a broader national conversation about race and the direction of affirmative action following a Supreme Court ruling. The barbershop clientele, including Tolliver, expressed their views on race in America, citing progress but also acknowledging persistent issues. The text also touches on the NAACP's retracted plan to honor Sterling and questions his motives for charitable donations. A dissenting perspective is presented by Drew Palmer, who criticizes the focus on Sterling while other societal issues, such as the use of derogatory language in popular culture, are ignored.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. However, the mention of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests a readiness to move beyond affirmative action is juxtaposed with the ongoing issues of racism highlighted by the Donald Sterling scandal. This contrast may imply that despite legal and institutional progress, societal attitudes and behaviors still necessitate a conversation about race and potentially the need for measures like affirmative action. The author seems to suggest that while legal structures might evolve, the underlying social issues that affirmative action aims to address remain prevalent, as evidenced by the sentiments and experiences shared by the individuals in the barbershop."	0.030109999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action, as evidenced by their favorable view of the University of Texas at Austin's program. They recognize the necessity of a nuanced approach to admissions that includes race among its criteria to achieve a diverse educational environment. The author's acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue and the call for clearer guidance from the Supreme Court further suggest a thoughtful and informed stance in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reaffirmed the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action program, which is now set to be reviewed again by the Supreme Court. The University of Texas fills most of its seats through a policy that guarantees admission to students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school class, which indirectly promotes diversity due to racial segregation in Texas schools. The remainder of the admissions are determined through a holistic review where race can be considered as one of many factors. Opponents argue that the top 10 percent rule already achieves sufficient diversity, but the university maintains that a more nuanced approach is necessary to create a diverse educational environment.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective is supportive of affirmative action, specifically the University of Texas at Austin's program. They acknowledge the complexity and sensitivity of using race as a criterion in admissions but argue that the university's approach is a prime example of a permissible, narrowly tailored affirmative-action policy. The editorial board suggests that the university's program complements the race-neutral top 10 percent rule and is a cautious effort to achieve a diverse student body. They also point out the ongoing issue of racial segregation in Texas schools and the need for a more comprehensive tool to consider a wider array of student experiences and contributions. Furthermore, the author calls on the Supreme Court to provide clearer guidance on what constitutes a constitutionally acceptable affirmative-action policy and to affirm the validity of UT Austin's program."	0.02293	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	4
	None	The text summary provided by the user does not mention affirmative action, nor does it provide any indicators of the author's stance on the topic. The discussion is centered around the issue of campus rape and the procedures for handling such cases, which is a separate matter from affirmative action. Therefore, there is not enough information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses the complexities of handling campus rape cases, focusing on the case of Paul Nungesser and Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University. Sulkowicz, who accused Nungesser of rape and carried a mattress around campus in protest, received media attention and was invited by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand to the State of the Union address. However, Nungesser was cleared by a campus tribunal, and subsequent media coverage raised questions about the allegations. The U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.) has instructed universities to handle sexual assault cases internally, which has led to criticism that the guidelines undermine due process and the rights of the accused. The author suggests that universities should demand a rethinking of these guidelines, clarify definitions of sexual misconduct, adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" for guilt, and work with local law enforcement to improve the handling of sexual violence cases.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The text provided does not explicitly discuss affirmative action. Instead, it focuses on the issue of campus rape and the procedures universities use to adjudicate such cases. The author critiques the current system imposed by the Department of Education, which they argue has swung too far in trying to correct past failures to address sexual assault seriously. The author suggests that this has led to a lack of due process for the accused and a loss of credibility in campus procedures. The author's perspective is that universities should push back against government guidelines that conflict with due process and work more closely with the criminal justice system to handle cases of sexual violence."	0.02999	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, William G. Bowen, is characterized as somewhat in favor of affirmative action. While the text does not provide a detailed exposition of his stance on the policies of affirmative action itself, it does indicate that Bowen sees affirmative action as a legitimate and central concern for academic institutions. This is inferred from his view that universities should focus on issues central to their educational mission, which he explicitly includes affirmative action as an example of. However, since the text does not provide specific arguments for or against affirmative action, but merely acknowledges its relevance to academia, the categorization is 'somewhat in favor' rather than 'strongly in favor'.	"Summary:
William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, discusses the rise in campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuel companies. He finds practical objections to divestment, such as the potential negative impact on endowment funds and the effectiveness of divestment, persuasive. Bowen argues that universities should not feel obligated to take a stance on every issue of broad social importance unless it's central to their educational mission, like affirmative action. He believes that taking institutional stands on political issues can threaten the educational mission of the university, which should be a place for open argument and diverse critical perspectives.

Bowen's main concern with the divestment debates is the moral perils associated with it, such as potential hypocrisy, the obligation to honor donor intent, the danger of substituting institutional actions for individual civic responsibility, and the diversion of attention from pressing educational priorities. He emphasizes the need for educational institutions to focus on improving educational outcomes and controlling costs to address affordability. Bowen concludes by stressing the importance of considering how to contribute to the common good, both as institutions and individuals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William G. Bowen, views affirmative action as an issue with a direct and legitimate claim on academia because it affects educational processes and outcomes. He differentiates affirmative action from other social or political issues that may not be as central to a university's core educational mission. Bowen suggests that while universities should be cautious about taking institutional stands on political matters, affirmative action is an exception as it is inherently tied to the functioning and quality of education. This perspective indicates that Bowen sees affirmative action as integral to the academic environment and its commitment to diversity and equal opportunity."	0.028470000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action in the provided summary. Instead, he uses affirmative action as an example in the context of a larger discussion about hate speech policies and the challenges of defining hate speech without infringing on free speech rights. The summary does not provide enough information to determine Chemerinsky's stance on affirmative action itself, as his focus is on the implications of policy-making and the protection of free speech.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, addresses the complex issue of developing a hate-speech policy at the University of California campuses, following recent anti-Semitic incidents. The regents did not adopt proposed ""principles against intolerance"" but instead formed a committee to revisit the matter. Chemerinsky outlines the challenge of crafting a policy that respects the First Amendment's free speech protections while also aiming to curtail hate speech. He critiques the vagueness of past university policies that have been struck down as unconstitutional and highlights the difficulty in defining hate speech. He suggests that universities adopt policies that clearly delineate unprotected speech, such as threats and harassment, without limiting protected speech. He also encourages universities to use their own free speech rights to counteract offensive speech with more speech, in line with their educational mission.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky touches on affirmative action in the context of discussing what might constitute hate speech under proposed policies. He raises the question of whether advocating for affirmative action could be interpreted as stigmatizing racial minorities by suggesting they need preferential treatment to compete. This hypothetical is used to illustrate the potential overreach of hate speech policies and the challenges in defining what counts as stigmatizing or victimizing speech. The author does not explicitly state his own views on affirmative action; rather, he uses it as an example to argue for the importance of protecting free speech and to demonstrate the complexities involved in regulating speech on university campuses."	0.02577	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's text does not directly address affirmative action in a way that would clearly indicate a stance for or against it. The mention of affirmative action is within the context of discussing the broader trend of 'the politics of self-esteem' and how moral issues become politically charged. The text focuses on the impact of this trend on political discourse and the difficulty it creates for political compromise, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, there is not enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the phenomenon of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where people engage in politics to feel morally superior and boost their self-esteem. This trend has contributed to the rise of Donald Trump, whose popularity among Republicans grows as he continues to defy conventional norms and propose controversial policies, such as banning Muslim immigrants, which are often framed in moral terms rather than economic ones. The author argues that Trump's success is due to his ability to tap into the desire of his supporters to assert their moral superiority and defy the judgments of the political establishment and mainstream media. This dynamic creates a dilemma for Trump's critics, as denouncing his ideas can inadvertently increase his popularity. The text concludes that this focus on self-esteem and moral sanctimony in politics makes political compromise more difficult.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly provide a detailed perspective on affirmative action within the provided text. However, affirmative action is mentioned as one of the moral issues that have become politically charged and contribute to the politics of self-esteem. The author suggests that issues like affirmative action are cast in moral terms and are more combustible politically compared to economic matters, as they often do not allow for easy compromise. The implication is that affirmative action, like other moral issues, is part of the broader trend where political engagement is driven by the desire for moral superiority and psychic benefits rather than by a focus on practical policy outcomes. The author's primary focus is on the overall political climate and how self-esteem politics affects political discourse and action, rather than on affirmative action specifically."	0.02685	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The text does not provide an explicit perspective on affirmative action. It only mentions that the Supreme Court's new term included cases dealing with affirmative action, among other issues, without offering any personal commentary or analysis on the matter. Therefore, there is no basis to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text provided is a series of news highlights from various months, covering a wide range of topics. In January 2014, the Chief Justice announced that the Supreme Court would make documents available online by 2016. The same month saw the tragic attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, which raised questions about the limits of free speech. In June, uncertainty surrounded the Republican response to potential rulings against Obamacare, and the horrific shooting by Dylann Roof at a black church in Charleston highlighted ongoing gun control issues. Concerns about Republican candidates alienating women voters, particularly due to Donald Trump's rhetoric, were noted. Reports surfaced about ISIS's treatment of Yazidi women, and Trump was not the only Republican suggesting the construction of a wall to address immigration. The UN's controversial decision to appoint a Saudi Arabian official to a human rights council panel, Speaker John Boehner's resignation, and disagreements between the U.S. and Russia over Syria's leadership were also mentioned. The Supreme Court's new term, with cases on abortion, religious rights, and affirmative action, placed Justice Anthony Kennedy in a pivotal role. The text also touched on the inconsistent media labeling of attackers in the U.S. and Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants following the San Bernardino attacks.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not provide an explicit perspective on affirmative action. It simply states that the Supreme Court's new term in October included cases dealing with affirmative action, among other issues. The mention of Justice Anthony Kennedy being at the center of it all suggests his potential role as a swing vote in these cases. However, without further information or context, the author's personal stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided."	0.022449999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1752156404.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, appears to be strongly in favor of affirmative action, specifically for low-income students. He advocates for a 'poverty preference' in college admissions, which aligns with the principles of affirmative action by aiming to correct the imbalances and disadvantages faced by this demographic. Levy's focus on leveling the playing field, providing equal opportunities, and maintaining ethnic diversity in colleges further underscores his support for affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of the New York City schools, discusses the disadvantages faced by smart, low-income students in gaining admission to selective colleges. A study by the foundation found that only 3% of students at top colleges come from the bottom 25% income bracket, while 72% come from the wealthiest quartile. Levy highlights several barriers, including legacy and athletic preferences that favor the wealthy, the high cost of standardized test preparation, early admissions programs that low-income students can't commit to without knowing their financial aid, and insufficient college counseling for low-income students. He advocates for a ""poverty preference"" in admissions, which would serve as a form of affirmative action for low-income students and also help maintain ethnic diversity in colleges.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy supports affirmative action for low-income students as a means to level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for academically qualified students, regardless of their financial background. He believes that while standardized tests should remain a part of admissions criteria, more credit should be given to low-income students who achieve high levels without the advantages that wealth provides. Levy argues that this would not only increase fairness in the college admissions process but also potentially preserve ethnic diversity, especially if race-conscious affirmative action is limited by the Supreme Court. He emphasizes that having wealthy parents does not make a student more deserving of a college admission, and that all young people should have a fair chance at academic success based on true merit."	0.02639	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors are in favor of affirmative action, specifically when it is used to enhance ideological diversity within academia. They argue that diversity of perspectives is crucial for truth-seeking and civil discourse, and they suggest that affirmative action should be extended to include political diversity, particularly to be more welcoming to conservative viewpoints. Their stance is based on the belief that diversity is valuable and that affirmative action policies should reflect this by encompassing a broader range of diversity, including ideological diversity.	"Summary:
The authors, both conservative professors, acknowledge bias against conservatives in academia, particularly within social sciences, where conservatives are underrepresented compared to other fields like business, engineering, and health sciences. They cite studies indicating that conservative students often avoid social sciences, feel uncomfortable in politically charged classes, and are less satisfied with social science courses. The authors note that conservative PhD students avoid politicized subfields, and that economics is an exception with balanced political representation. They argue that political homogeneity within academia hinders the pursuit of truth and civil discourse. The authors suggest that affirmative action should also consider ideological diversity, referencing Justice Powell's opinion on the importance of diverse perspectives. They propose measures to make academia more welcoming to conservatives, such as inviting conservative speakers, hiring faculty with diverse viewpoints, and offering courses that might attract conservative scholars.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors support the idea of affirmative action when it serves to increase diversity of perspectives, which they believe is essential for discovering truth and fostering civil discourse. They reference Justice Powell's opinion from the Regents of the University of California v. Bakke case to support the notion that a multitude of perspectives is necessary for the pursuit of truth. The authors argue that if diversity is a core value of universities, then ideological diversity should be included. They suggest that affirmative action has moved beyond remedial justice to embrace diversity more broadly, and that extending this to include political diversity, particularly conservative voices, would be consistent with the principles that have guided the expansion of affirmative action in the past. The authors do not endorse preferences in admissions and hiring but suggest that universities should take steps to be more inclusive of conservative viewpoints to improve the academic environment and the legitimacy of universities in a polarized society."	0.030580000000000003	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's description of the Supreme Court's decision and the context of the case suggest a positive view of affirmative action. The text emphasizes the importance of diversity in higher education and the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions processes. The author's recounting of the majority opinion and the rationale behind it indicates approval of the decision and the goals of affirmative action. The mention of the ongoing challenges to affirmative action, along with the defense of its necessity in addressing racial inequalities, further underscores the author's support. The author's perspective is not neutral or against affirmative action; instead, it aligns with the view that affirmative action is essential for promoting diversity and equality, indicating a stance that is 'somewhat in favor' or 'strongly in favor' of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's race-conscious admissions process. The ruling, made with a 4 to 3 majority, reaffirms the constitutionality of considering race as one factor among many in university admissions to achieve diversity. The case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who was denied admission and claimed the policy discriminated against white applicants. The University of Texas employs a dual admissions system: one that automatically admits the top 10 percent of high school graduates statewide, and another holistic review that considers race alongside other factors. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, emphasized the deference universities deserve in defining educational goals like diversity, while also noting the need for those goals to be measurable and policies to be regularly reviewed. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself, and Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away. The court had previously remanded the case to a lower court in 2013. Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito strongly opposed the use of race in admissions, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that even the top 10 percent rule is implicitly race-conscious due to high school segregation in Texas.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text appears to be in favor of affirmative action policies in college admissions. They view the Supreme Court's decision as a strong reaffirmation of the value of diversity in higher education and a necessary measure to reflect the racial and ethnic makeup of contemporary America. The author acknowledges the ongoing attacks on precedent supporting affirmative action but seems to appreciate the court's recognition of the educational and social benefits of a diverse student body. The author also suggests that critics who call for a colorblind society or the cessation of race-conscious policies fail to recognize the existing racial inequalities that such policies aim to address. Justice Kennedy's skepticism of affirmative action is noted, but his vote in the Fisher case is seen as a critical endorsement of the right of universities to shape diverse student bodies. The author's perspective is that affirmative action remains a vital tool for promoting diversity and equality in education."	0.03199	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Marilynne Rudick, expresses frustration with the implementation of medical marijuana being delayed due to issues surrounding affirmative action in the licensing process. Rudick criticizes the use of affirmative action in this context as a distraction from the law's original purpose, which is to provide medical marijuana to patients. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action is seen as a secondary concern that should not interfere with patient access to medical marijuana. Therefore, while Rudick is not commenting on affirmative action as a general policy, the author is critical of its application in this specific scenario.	"Summary:
The text is a letter expressing frustration over the delayed implementation of medical marijuana in Maryland due to controversies surrounding geographic diversity in the awarding of licenses to grow it. The author, Marilynne Rudick, is a person with multiple sclerosis who stands to benefit from medical marijuana. Rudick criticizes Maryland politicians for losing sight of the original purpose of the law, which is to provide medical marijuana to patients, not to serve as an economic development or affirmative action initiative. Rudick urges politicians and regulators to expedite the process of making medical marijuana available to those in need.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Marilynne Rudick, seems to hold a critical view of affirmative action in the context of the medical marijuana program in Maryland. Rudick suggests that affirmative action should not be a consideration in the process of awarding licenses to grow medical marijuana. The focus, according to the author, should solely be on the medical aspect and ensuring that patients who require medical marijuana receive it promptly. The criticism implies that affirmative action is viewed as a distraction or a complication that is contributing to the delays in the implementation of the medical marijuana program."	0.01608	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not directly address affirmative action in the text. The focus is on Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court and the potential implications for progressive causes in general, which may include affirmative action among other issues. The author's primary concern is with Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and how it might impact progressive causes, but there is no explicit stance on affirmative action itself. The mention of Gorsuch's possible effect on progressive causes suggests that the author may be cautious about Gorsuch's impact on affirmative action, but without a direct statement, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined.	"Summary:
The text discusses the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. It suggests that instead of the expected softballs from Republicans and the portrayal of Gorsuch by Democrats as hostile to ""the little guy,"" a more meaningful discussion should be had about Gorsuch's views on the Constitution, the role of precedent, and how the court should adapt to changing times. Democrats, still upset over the blocking of Merrick Garland by Republicans, are under pressure to oppose Gorsuch and are concerned about the impact his confirmation could have on progressive causes. The text also touches on Gorsuch's originalist interpretation of the Constitution and raises questions about how this might influence his decisions on the Supreme Court. The author argues for a thorough inquiry into Gorsuch's judicial philosophy beyond his professional qualifications.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a perspective on affirmative action. However, they do raise concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, which include affirmative action. The text suggests that Gorsuch's originalist approach to the Constitution could influence his rulings on rights and liberties that have been recognized in more recent times, potentially impacting decisions related to affirmative action. The author implies that understanding Gorsuch's views on precedent and the Constitution's adaptation to modern society is crucial, as it will shape the court's role in addressing such issues. Given that affirmative action is one of the progressive causes mentioned, it can be inferred that the author is advocating for a careful examination of Gorsuch's stance on such matters to predict how his confirmation might affect future rulings on affirmative action and similar topics."	0.031119999999999995	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's main focus is on the broader issue of political bias in ballot language, rather than on affirmative action as a policy. The text does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action itself but rather uses it as an example of where political bias can occur in the presentation of ballot initiatives. The author's concern is with the neutrality of ballot titles and summaries, suggesting a preference for nonpartisan drafting of such texts. The mention of affirmative action is incidental to the larger argument about political bias and does not indicate a clear position for or against the policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy over the wording of ballot initiative titles and summaries, particularly when they are written by an attorney general from one political party and the initiative is backed by another. Republicans sued California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for allegedly using a biased title for their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees, claiming it was intentionally opaque to reduce support. The text cites past instances where attorneys general were accused of bias in summarizing ballot measures, including the avoidance of the term ""affirmative action"" in Proposition 209. It suggests that the responsibility of writing ballot titles and summaries should be given to a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), to ensure neutrality. The idea, while supported by some organizations, has not gained traction in the legislature.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action itself is not directly stated, but they do highlight a historical instance where the term ""affirmative action"" was deliberately omitted from the summary of Proposition 209 by then-Attorney General Dan Lungren. This suggests that the author recognizes the sensitivity and potential for bias in how ballot measures related to affirmative action (and other contentious issues) are presented to voters. The example implies that the author may be concerned about how political motivations can influence the framing of ballot initiatives on important social policies like affirmative action. However, the author's main focus is on the broader issue of political bias in ballot language, rather than on affirmative action as a policy."	0.025820000000000003	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Bärí A. Williams, is critical of the tech industry's shift towards emphasizing 'cognitive diversity' at the expense of racial and gender diversity. Williams argues that this trend can serve as an excuse to avoid addressing the significant underrepresentation of Black, Latino, and female employees in the tech industry. She emphasizes the importance of maintaining a commitment to traditional diversity, which includes race and gender, alongside cognitive diversity. Her perspective shows a clear support for affirmative action and a concern that its goals are being undermined by a narrow focus on cognitive diversity.	"Summary:
Denise Young Smith, Apple's VP of Diversity and Inclusion, sparked controversy by suggesting that a group of white men can be diverse if they bring different life experiences and perspectives. After facing backlash, she clarified her statement, emphasizing that diversity at Apple includes women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and all underrepresented minorities. The author, Bärí A. Williams, criticizes the tech industry's trend towards prioritizing ""cognitive diversity"" over race and gender diversity, arguing that this approach dilutes efforts to address the significant underrepresentation of these groups in the sector. Williams points out that focusing solely on cognitive diversity can be an excuse to avoid increasing the low numbers of Black, Latino, and female employees in tech. She warns that this shift may send a discouraging message to potential applicants from underrepresented groups and stresses the need for tech companies to maintain a commitment to traditional diversity.

Author's Perspective:
Bärí A. Williams is critical of the way affirmative action and diversity are being redefined within the tech industry. She believes that the concept of cognitive diversity, while important, should not overshadow or replace efforts to increase race and gender diversity. Williams argues that the focus on cognitive diversity can lead to a complacent attitude where tech companies believe they have achieved diversity without making substantive changes to the composition of their workforce. She views the current underrepresentation of women, Black, and Latino individuals in tech as a serious issue that requires dedicated effort to rectify. Williams is concerned that the redefinition of diversity to prioritize cognitive aspects could result in the neglect of cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability, and especially gender and racial differences that are crucial to creating a truly diverse and inclusive environment. She advocates for a balanced approach where cognitive diversity is sought alongside a strong commitment to increasing identity diversity, ensuring that underrepresented communities are given equitable opportunities in the tech industry."	0.04088	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The text does not explicitly mention the author's stance on affirmative action. However, based on the discussion of the author's views on racism and the need to confront and address it, we can infer that the author would likely be in favor of affirmative action. Kendi's critique of denialism in racism suggests that he recognizes systemic barriers and would likely support measures like affirmative action to address racial inequalities. The author's focus on the need to confront and confess to racism implies a perspective that would align with affirmative action as a tool for promoting racial justice.	"Summary:
The text discusses the pervasive issue of denial in American society, particularly regarding racism. The author, Ibram X. Kendi, argues that Americans of all political stripes and ideologies often deny the existence of racism within themselves and society at large. This denial is a defense mechanism to maintain a sense of superiority and avoid confronting the uncomfortable reality of systemic racism. Kendi cites President Trump's alleged derogatory remarks about African countries as a recent example of this denial. He also points out that Trump's racism is not exceptional but is part of a long history of American presidents who have exhibited racist behaviors and policies. Kendi criticizes the use of coded language to disguise racist sentiments and policies, which allows individuals to deny their racism. He concludes by asserting that being racist is not an identity but a reflection of one's actions and words, and that true anti-racism requires a willingness to confess and confront racism rather than deny it.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action, it can be inferred that Kendi views denial of racism as a barrier to acknowledging the need for policies like affirmative action. Kendi criticizes those who resist affirmative action policies, suggesting that they are part of a group that denies their own racist attitudes while maintaining racist policies. He sees the denial of racism as a significant obstacle to racial progress and suggests that confronting and confessing to racism is necessary to move towards an anti-racist society. Given this context, Kendi likely views affirmative action as a necessary response to systemic racism and a step towards equality, which is often obstructed by the denial of racism's existence and impact."	0.0348	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action within the provided summary. The text focuses on the issue of gun control and the cultural shifts in political discourse, mentioning affirmative action only in the context of ideas that are becoming controversial to oppose in certain circles. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given summary as their primary concern is about the polarization of political debate and the silencing of dissent, not the issue of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The author begins by questioning their initial belief that while public support for moderate gun restrictions is strong, legislative action is weak. They note that since the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, most state laws have further loosened gun restrictions, and nearly all gun-related bills in Congress have failed, except for one that also loosened gun use. The author suggests that to pass any gun restrictions, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue and respect gun owners, drawing a parallel with the bipartisan approach to the opioid crisis.

However, the author observes that the push for gun restrictions has become highly polarized, with left-wing groups supporting student activists from Parkland in a manner that has led to extreme rhetoric and further division. Early legislative responses have rejected gun restrictions, and the author predicts that Democrats may lose seats in pro-gun states in the 2018 elections.

Despite this, the author acknowledges a broader cultural shift where progressives may be succeeding in delegitimizing their opponents, not just on gun rights but on various issues, potentially leading to significant social changes. They highlight two changes: conservatives have marginalized themselves by aligning with Donald Trump, and progressives are increasingly silencing dissenting opinions, with a range of ideas now considered unacceptable in elite circles.

The author warns that these tactics of cultural stigmatization and intimidation could lead to a backlash, as conservatives still hold significant political power. They caution progressives that winning by intimidation rather than persuasion could breed further illiberalism and potentially provoke a political response stronger than the rise of Donald Trump.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly discuss their personal perspective on affirmative action in the provided text. However, they do mention it as one of several ideas that have become controversial and potentially career-ending if opposed. This suggests that the author sees affirmative action as part of a broader cultural debate where certain viewpoints are increasingly being deemed unacceptable by progressive forces within society. The author's concern seems to be more about the methods of cultural enforcement and the potential for backlash rather than the merits or demerits of affirmative action itself."	0.03234	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	Richard Cohen's perspective is critical of affirmative action in the context of Stuyvesant High School's admissions, as he believes the current test-based system is fair and rewards hard work and merit, particularly for poor Asian immigrant families. He is concerned that Mayor de Blasio's plan to scrap the test in favor of increasing diversity would unfairly penalize Asian American students who have earned their place. Cohen's stance suggests he is against affirmative action when it results in disadvantages for those who succeed through effort and merit.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding New York City's Stuyvesant High School, which has a predominantly Asian American student body. Mayor Bill de Blasio considers the lack of Hispanic and black students at the school a ""monumental injustice"" and has proposed changing the admissions system to increase diversity. The current system is based solely on an entrance exam, which the author argues is a fair method that rewards hard work and study, often by children from poor Asian immigrant families. The author, Richard Cohen, criticizes the mayor's plan to scrap the test and expresses limited tolerance for affirmative action, especially when it disadvantages those who have earned their place through effort.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Richard Cohen's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially in the context of Stuyvesant High School's admissions process. He views the current system, which relies solely on entrance exam scores, as fair and merit-based. Cohen suggests that affirmative action should not come at the expense of Asian American students, many of whom are from low-income families and have earned their admission through dedication and hard work. He expresses concern that Mayor de Blasio's plan to increase diversity by changing the admissions process would unfairly penalize these students and undermine a system that rewards merit and effort, which he associates with the American dream. Cohen's tolerance for affirmative action is limited and he opposes it in situations where it would disadvantage individuals who have played by the rules and succeeded on their own merits."	0.0266	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, David Leonhardt, appears to be neutral or pragmatic about affirmative action in the context of political strategy rather than expressing a moral or ideological stance on the policy itself. He advises Democrats to focus on issues with broader public support instead of affirmative action during midterm campaigns, indicating that he sees it as a potentially divisive issue that may not be advantageous in the electoral context. His perspective is more about the strategic value of certain issues in politics rather than a direct support or opposition to affirmative action.	"Summary:
David Leonhardt's opinion piece discusses the Democratic Party's response to President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee and the broader implications for the party's strategy. He outlines a three-step guide for Democrats on how to navigate the situation:

1. Be realistic: Acknowledge that Trump's nominee is likely to be confirmed due to the Republican majority in the Senate, and that court nominations tend to unite political parties.

2. Don’t lose hope: Understand that while the Supreme Court may have a conservative majority, progressives can still win on issues by focusing on local, state, and congressional elections, similar to how conservatives built their movement historically.

3. Know your strengths: Focus on issues where Democrats have public opinion on their side, like health insurance, taxation, and government corruption, rather than social issues like abortion and affirmative action that may not resonate as strongly with the electorate during midterms.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Leonhardt suggests that Democrats should not prioritize affirmative action as a key issue during the midterm campaign. He implies that affirmative action, along with other social issues that inspire liberal passion, might not be the most strategic choice for Democrats to focus on as it may not align with the broader electorate's views. Leonhardt's perspective seems to be that while these issues are important, they may not be the most effective topics for winning elections given the current political climate. He advises Democrats to concentrate on issues where they have a decisive advantage in public opinion."	0.02704	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author initially commends Wilson's early support for affirmative action but later criticizes his efforts to eliminate it, framing this as a betrayal of earlier principles. The criticism of Wilson's reversal suggests that the author believes affirmative action is necessary and beneficial for minorities, and that Wilson's shift is viewed negatively. The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be that it is an important tool for addressing racial inequality, and Wilson's actions to dismantle it are seen as regressive.	"Summary:
The text is a reflection on the career of former California Governor Pete Wilson, who served as an assemblyman, mayor of San Diego, U.S. senator, and governor. The author thanks Wilson for his moderate political approach and early efforts to protect wetlands, implement affirmative action, and address racial injustices, such as co-sponsoring the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. However, the author criticizes Wilson for later actions that undermined his centrist legacy, such as deregulating California's electricity, signing three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted illegal immigrants. These actions, according to the author, had negative consequences but also galvanized Latino political activism and awareness. The piece ends with a sarcastic tone, suggesting that Wilson's legacy serves as a cautionary tale and that he remains out of touch with the current political climate.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author initially commends Wilson for his affirmative action hiring practices during his mayoral tenure, indicating support for such measures as a way to address historical inequalities faced by minorities. However, the author later criticizes Wilson for his efforts to eliminate affirmative action at the University of California and beyond, framing this as a betrayal of his earlier principles. The author suggests that Wilson's reversal on affirmative action radicalized college students and implies that the elimination of these programs was a step backward in the fight for racial equality. The perspective presented is that affirmative action is necessary and beneficial for minorities, and Wilson's shift away from supporting it is seen as a significant flaw in his political career."	0.02883	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, does not directly express a personal stance for or against affirmative action in the provided summary. Instead, he highlights the role of Supreme Court justices' value judgments in determining what constitutes a compelling government interest, using affirmative action as an example of such a case. Chemerinsky's discussion centers on the interpretive role of justices and how their ideologies influence their decisions on complex constitutional questions, including affirmative action. The summary does not contain explicit support or opposition to affirmative action, but rather emphasizes the necessity for justices to make value choices in their interpretations.	"Summary:
Erwin Chemerinsky, a distinguished professor of law, criticizes the analogy used by Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh, that likens justices to umpires who apply rules impartially. Chemerinsky argues that unlike umpires, Supreme Court justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law and that their decisions are influenced by their ideologies. He points out that the Constitution's broad language requires justices to interpret its meaning in the context of modern issues, which inevitably involves their personal ideologies and experiences. Chemerinsky uses examples such as the 2nd Amendment and the 4th Amendment to illustrate how justices' decisions reflect ideological divides. He also discusses the role of value judgments in determining what constitutes a compelling government interest, as seen in cases involving affirmative action and same-sex marriage. Chemerinsky concludes by stating that the notion of justices as neutral umpires is misleading and that the contentious nature of Supreme Court confirmations reflects the public's understanding of the ideological role of justices.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action is that it involves a constitutional question about whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. He suggests that determining whether an interest is ""compelling,"" ""important,"" or ""legitimate"" requires a value choice that cannot be answered solely by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. This implies that Chemerinsky sees affirmative action as a complex issue that necessitates a judgment call by the justices, one that is influenced by their individual ideologies and life experiences rather than a neutral application of the law. His view indicates that he believes affirmative action is a matter where the Supreme Court's role is to interpret the Constitution in a way that reflects contemporary values and societal needs, rather than adhering to a strict originalist perspective."	0.02914	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed through the lens of skepticism regarding Brett Kavanaugh's stance. The author references the concerns raised by Elizabeth Wydra about Kavanaugh's past criticisms of affirmative action policies, as revealed in his White House memos. The use of phrases like 'naked racial set-aside' and 'racial spoils system' in Kavanaugh's memos, as highlighted by the author, suggests a negative view of affirmative action. Although the author does not explicitly state their own stance, the focus on these criticisms and the concern for civil rights progress implies that the author may be somewhat against Kavanaugh's apparent position on affirmative action, which could be interpreted as being against affirmative action itself. However, the author's main intent seems to be to report on the nominee's potential impact on affirmative action rather than to express a personal stance on the policy.	"Summary:
The Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was highly partisan, with Democrats attempting to halt proceedings over withheld documents and Republicans accusing them of political grandstanding. Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican votes. The hearing was seen as less informative about the nominee's views, continuing a trend of nominees revealing little during such proceedings. There has been a decline in bipartisan support for Supreme Court nominees over the years. Kavanaugh's testimony did not reassure women's rights advocates or liberal scholars, particularly regarding his views on abortion, employment discrimination, immigration, healthcare, and affirmative action. While Kavanaugh recognized Roe v. Wade as precedent, he did not confirm if he believed it was correctly decided. He also avoided directly supporting the Obergefell v. Hodges decision on same-sex marriage but acknowledged the importance of equal rights for LGBTQ individuals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author highlights a critical perspective of Kavanaugh's stance on affirmative action through the observations of Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. Wydra points out a concerning contrast between Kavanaugh's public commendation of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling and his private White House memos that criticized affirmative action policies using terms such as ""naked racial set-aside"" and ""racial spoils system."" These memos indicate Kavanaugh's disapproval of affirmative action measures designed to address systemic racism. The author's reporting suggests skepticism about Kavanaugh's commitment to upholding affirmative action policies, reflecting concerns that his confirmation could endanger civil rights progress."	0.036379999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt	4
	None	The text summary provided does not directly address the author's perspective on affirmative action as it is traditionally understood in the context of policies aimed at increasing opportunities for historically marginalized groups. Instead, the term 'affirmative action' is used in a different context related to immigration policy. The author Pierre Bertrand seems to support Angela Merkel's welcoming policy towards Syrian refugees, which could be seen as a form of affirmative action in a broader sense of taking positive steps to help a disadvantaged group. However, since the traditional context of affirmative action is not discussed, and the term is used in a different sense, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action as it is typically defined.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor discuss reactions to Hillary Clinton's comments on European immigration policy. Pierre Bertrand, a former UNHCR director, disagrees with Clinton's stance, arguing that it contradicts human rights principles and the spirit of Europe, as exemplified by Angela Merkel's acceptance of Syrian refugees. Lorna Salzman praises Clinton for recognizing that uncontrolled migration has fueled the rise of right-wing movements due to cultural differences and the left's failure to address them. Jane Carey suggests that the focus on immigration is misplaced and that the root causes, such as Western interference in foreign conflicts and climate change, should be addressed instead.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The first letter by Pierre Bertrand refers to ""affirmative actions"" in the context of Angela Merkel's policy towards Syrian refugees. Here, the term ""affirmative action"" is used to describe Merkel's positive steps to welcome and integrate refugees into Germany. Bertrand seems to view these actions favorably, contrasting them with Clinton's call for stricter immigration controls, which he sees as politically motivated and contrary to human rights.

It's important to note that the term ""affirmative action"" is more commonly used in the context of policies aimed at increasing opportunities for historically marginalized groups within a society, particularly in education and employment. However, in the context of these letters, the term is applied to the acceptance and support of refugees, which the author views as a moral and ethical obligation under international human rights standards. Bertrand's perspective is that affirmative actions in this context are necessary and commendable, aligning with the principles of human rights and European unity."	0.02534	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the article expresses a critical view of affirmative action policies, highlighting their failure to achieve the intended goals and their potential to exacerbate racial and ethnic tensions. The author also suggests that these policies often benefit the wealthier individuals within disadvantaged groups rather than the most underprivileged. The use of examples from Malaysia and the U.S., along with data suggesting socioeconomic progress occurred more significantly before or without affirmative action, indicates a stance that is critical of the effectiveness and implementation of these policies.	"Summary:
The article discusses the issue of affirmative action policies, both in Malaysia and the United States. In Malaysia, 55,000 people protested to defend race-based policies that favor the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These policies, which include advantages in education, housing, government jobs, and access to capital, were intended to create ""racial balance"" but were supposed to end in 1991. Instead, they have been extended for political reasons. Critics argue that these policies now primarily benefit the wealthier Malays, fail the poor, and exacerbate ethnic tensions. 

The author draws parallels with affirmative action in the U.S., where policies intended to help underprivileged minorities are said to often benefit those who are already well-off, and where liberal politicians and courts claim that such policies are temporary. The author cites examples of racial tensions in U.S. education, such as the lawsuit against Harvard for alleged discrimination against Asian applicants and controversy over admissions to New York City's top public high schools.

The author is skeptical about the effectiveness of affirmative action, pointing out that in Malaysia, despite over 50 years of preferential treatment, the Malays have not caught up to the ethnic Chinese in terms of educational and economic achievement. Similarly, in the U.S., the author argues that the growth of the black middle class and professional advancement occurred more significantly before the implementation of affirmative action, and that the University of California system saw improvements for black students after ending race-based admissions.

Author's Perspective:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical. He questions the effectiveness of these policies, suggesting they do not achieve their intended goals and may in fact be counterproductive. He believes that affirmative action tends to benefit those who are already well-off rather than the underprivileged and that it can lead to increased racial and ethnic tensions. The author also implies that affirmative action is often used as a political tool rather than a genuine effort to address inequality. He supports his argument with examples from both Malaysia and the U.S., and by citing data that challenges the notion that affirmative action has been the driving force behind any socioeconomic progress observed among the intended beneficiaries."	0.03138	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Jacob Weisberg, describes Moynihan's nuanced perspective on affirmative action, acknowledging the historical injustices faced by black Americans and the need for government action to support disadvantaged groups. Moynihan's support for affirmative action is presented as part of his broader intellectual approach to politics, which included a deep analysis of historical and social factors. Weisberg does not express his own view on affirmative action but focuses on Moynihan's complex stance. The summary indicates that Moynihan saw affirmative action as necessary but also recognized the challenges in discussing and implementing policies related to family structure and illegitimacy. Weisberg's discussion of Moynihan's views suggests that he sees the value in affirmative action within a larger framework of social policy, but does not provide a strong indication that Weisberg himself is advocating for or against affirmative action. Therefore, Weisberg's stance appears to be neutral, as he is primarily reporting on Moynihan's position without overtly endorsing or opposing affirmative action.	"**Summary:**
Jacob Weisberg provides an in-depth analysis of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's career, highlighting his intellectual prowess, his contributions to political thought, and his role in American politics. Despite his significant insights and critiques, Moynihan is portrayed as someone who struggled with the practical aspects of politics, often prioritizing being right over being effective. Weisberg discusses Moynihan's complex legacy, his personal history, and his influence on various policies and debates, including welfare reform and social policy. The article also touches on Moynihan's relationship with different administrations, his time in the Senate, and his eventual decision to retire.

**Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:**
The author, Jacob Weisberg, discusses Moynihan's nuanced position on affirmative action within the broader context of his views on social policy and racial equality. Moynihan supported affirmative action as part of a range of policies aimed at enhancing the stability and resources of the black American family, recognizing the historical impact of slavery and discrimination on family structures. However, Moynihan also believed that the topic of illegitimacy and family structure was difficult to discuss openly, which complicated the development of effective government responses.

Weisberg portrays Moynihan as someone who was deeply concerned with the structural issues facing black families and saw affirmative action as a means to address some of these challenges. Moynihan's report on the black family, which sparked controversy and debate, advocated for government commitment to addressing the problem, even though he did not delve deeply into specific remedies. His stance on affirmative action was part of his broader belief in the need for government action to support disadvantaged groups, while also being critical of the left's approach to social policy.

Weisberg suggests that Moynihan's support for affirmative action was consistent with his intellectual approach to politics, which often involved a deep analysis of historical and social factors. However, Moynihan's complex relationship with both Democrats and Republicans, as well as his experiences with the backlash from his report, influenced his views on how to effectively implement such policies. Overall, Weisberg presents Moynihan as a figure who grappled with the tension between analysis and action, and whose ideas on affirmative action and other social policies were shaped by his broader critique of government efforts to address social problems."	0.12389	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated. The text provides a balanced view by presenting arguments from both opponents and defenders of affirmative action, particularly in the context of the college admissions scandal. The mention of wealth as a significant factor in college admissions suggests that the author acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the interplay between race and economic status. However, without a clear statement of personal belief or endorsement of one side over the other, the author's stance cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, based on the provided summary, the author should be categorized as neutral on the issue of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses several instances where President Trump and other political figures have been accused of amplifying divisive or discriminatory rhetoric. It mentions Trump’s support for Fox News host Jeanine Pirro after she made comments about Representative Omar's hijab, suggesting Islamophobia. Senator Chris Coons called for Trump to apologize for disparaging the late Senator John McCain on Twitter. The college admissions scandal has reignited debates over affirmative action, with opponents arguing the scandal proves that elite colleges cannot be trusted to fairly assess applicants, while defenders argue that wealth, more than race, gives students an unfair advantage. Senator Amy Klobuchar criticizes Trump for amplifying racial and religious hatred, which she believes is divisive. Chris Wallace of Fox News is noted for attributing blame for the Christchurch mosque shootings to the terrorist, but also for acknowledging Trump’s history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric. The text also mentions an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker who physically retaliated against a teenager who egged him, and Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege while also highlighting his unique perspective as a candidate from the U.S./Mexico border.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to present affirmative action as a contentious issue, especially in light of the college admissions scandal. The scandal is seen as fuel for both sides of the debate. Opponents of affirmative action feel vindicated in their belief that the system is flawed and that elite colleges cannot be trusted to make unbiased admissions decisions. On the other hand, defenders of affirmative action argue that the real advantage in college admissions comes from wealth rather than race. The author's inclusion of the quote, ""There's a lot more kids at elite colleges because their parents are rich than because they're brown or black,"" suggests a perspective that the focus on affirmative action might be overshadowed by the larger issue of economic inequality in college admissions. The author does not explicitly state their own stance, but by presenting both sides, they highlight the complexity of the debate surrounding affirmative action."	0.02648	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, discusses the negative stigma associated with affirmative action and how it affects perceptions of her qualifications and authority in academia. Although she does not explicitly state whether she is for or against affirmative action, her commitment to diversity and representation, as well as her acknowledgment of the policy's intention to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, suggest that she is in favor of the policy's goals. However, she also highlights the negative consequences of the policy's misconceptions. Therefore, it can be inferred that Dr. Berry is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its importance but also acknowledging the challenges it brings.	"Summary:
The text is a personal account by Dr. Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Dr. Berry discusses the challenges she faces in academia due to her race and gender. She emphasizes the importance of being addressed by her title, ""Dr. Berry,"" particularly in the classroom, to establish respect and authority that is often automatically granted to her white male colleagues. Dr. Berry notes that despite her qualifications, some students presume she is less capable or was hired to fulfill diversity quotas, a stigma perpetuated by anti-affirmative-action sentiment. She shares experiences of having her teaching methods and authority questioned, something she believes her male colleagues are less likely to endure. Dr. Berry also highlights the underrepresentation of African-American women in engineering academia and expresses her commitment to changing the face of engineering by being a role model for diversity in the field.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dr. Carlotta Berry, has a critical perspective on how affirmative action is perceived. She acknowledges that anti-affirmative-action ideologues have successfully undermined the legitimacy of the policy and tarnished the reputations of individuals who might have benefited from it. Dr. Berry suggests that these negative perceptions contribute to the skepticism and bias she and others face in the academic world, even though she herself did not benefit from affirmative action in her hiring. She seems to view affirmative action as a policy that, while intended to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, has also led to misconceptions about the qualifications and capabilities of beneficiaries, thus impacting their professional experiences negatively. Despite this, Dr. Berry appears to believe in the importance of diversity and representation in academia and is committed to being a visible and positive example for others, particularly women and African-Americans in engineering."	0.030559999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author relays The Washington Post's endorsement of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policies. By characterizing the University's approach as a 'prime example' and suggesting that it should pass judicial scrutiny, the author indicates that The Washington Post views affirmative action as an effective means to promote diversity within higher education. The text suggests that the Post supports affirmative action, particularly when it is part of a conscientious design that includes race-neutral policies. This perspective aligns with being 'somewhat in favor' of affirmative action, as it acknowledges the need for such policies in achieving diversity but also emphasizes the importance of careful implementation.	"Summary:
The text discusses various editorial perspectives on current political and social issues. The New York Times editorial supports a bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy to end bulk collection of telephone records and increase transparency in government surveillance. The Washington Post editorial backs the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policies. The Boston Globe's editorial addresses the Massachusetts Legislature's response to the Supreme Court's criticism of the state's buffer-zone law at abortion clinics. The Guardian praises Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, for her focus on wage growth. The Globe and Mail editorial is optimistic about the progress against the colony collapse disorder affecting honeybees. Lastly, The Korea Herald editorial criticizes Japan for its response to the U.N. Committee on Human Rights' call for an investigation into wartime sex slavery and an apology to the 'comfort women.'

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents The Washington Post's perspective on affirmative action, specifically regarding the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policies. The Post views the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold these policies as a positive development. The editorial suggests that the University's approach is a ""prime example"" of the kind of affirmative-action program that should pass judicial scrutiny. The University of Texas complements its race-neutral ""top 10 percent program"" with a holistic review process to achieve diversity in its student body. The editorial implies that affirmative action, when conscientiously designed to work alongside race-neutral policies, is an effective and permissible way to promote diversity in higher education. The Post appears to support affirmative action as a necessary and careful effort to foster diversity and suggests that the Supreme Court should affirm the University's policy when the case returns to the justices."	0.03049	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The authors of the text present arguments that are supportive of affirmative action. William Kidder, Rosiland Jordan, Jane McAlevey, and Randal Maurice Jelks all provide reasons for why affirmative action is beneficial or necessary, ranging from the critique of the mismatch theory to the call for continued efforts to address systemic racism and educational inequalities. None of the authors express neutrality or opposition to affirmative action, and their arguments are based on the positive impact of affirmative action policies and the need to address broader societal and educational disparities.	"Summary:
The letters to the editor address the topic of affirmative action and the ""mismatch"" theory, which posits that affirmative action can harm minorities by placing them in schools where they may not be academically prepared. William Kidder criticizes the mismatch theory, citing that the majority of peer-reviewed research does not support it and that attending more selective universities is beneficial for African-American and Latino students. Rosiland Jordan argues that affirmative action is necessary due to societal valuation of degrees from certain institutions and the need to address inequalities in primary education and societal stereotypes. Jane McAlevey suggests affirmative action should remain until a better solution to racism is found and proven effective. Randal Maurice Jelks criticizes the assumptions of mismatch theory and highlights the success of historically black colleges in educating black students.

Author's Perspectives on Affirmative Action:
- William Kidder views affirmative action as a beneficial policy that does not suffer from the shortcomings suggested by the mismatch theory. He supports his view with research indicating that minority students benefit from attending more selective universities.
- Rosiland Jordan supports affirmative action, arguing that it is necessary due to the unequal value placed on degrees from different institutions and the systemic inequalities in education. She believes that the stigma associated with affirmative action for minority students would not exist if educational standards and resources were equalized from primary school onwards.
- Jane McAlevey believes affirmative action should continue until a better solution to systemic racism is found and successfully implemented. She suggests that the focus should be on creating more educational opportunities for young black individuals rather than incarcerating them.
- Randal Maurice Jelks critiques the mismatch theory for its reliance on test scores, which he argues are not a true measure of intellectual ability. He points out that the success of historically black colleges in educating black students indicates that institutional climate and support are significant factors in student achievement.

Overall, the authors express a positive perspective on affirmative action, seeing it as a necessary policy to combat systemic inequalities and to provide fair educational opportunities for minority students. They challenge the mismatch theory and emphasize the importance of supportive educational environments and resources."	0.028999999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appreciates Nixon's progressive policies, including his support for civil rights and affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action as part of Nixon's positive legacy implies that the author views affirmative action favorably. However, since the primary focus of the text is not on affirmative action, but rather on Obama's negotiation tactics and Nixon's overall policy approach, the author's stance on affirmative action is inferred rather than explicitly stated.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on President Obama's negotiation strategy during the debt ceiling agreement, as perceived by a successful Hollywood dealmaker who criticizes Obama for not being more assertive. The Hollywood figure suggests that Obama should have used the 14th Amendment as leverage against the Republicans, a tactic similar to Nixon's ""Madman Theory"" during the Vietnam War, which was meant to intimidate the North Vietnamese into thinking he might take extreme measures. The author reflects on Nixon's presidency, noting that despite his negative reputation, Nixon's policies were quite progressive and left-leaning compared to subsequent presidents. Nixon's domestic policies included the creation of various agencies, support for civil rights and affirmative action, welfare reforms, and détente in foreign policy. The author contrasts Nixon's tactical posturing with the current Republican Party, which is seen as genuinely extreme by the author's late mother and, presumably, by Nixon himself.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action positively, as part of Nixon's progressive legacy. He mentions that Nixon's administration was the first to begin affirmative action in federal hiring, suggesting that the author sees this as a commendable step toward equality and civil rights. This perspective indicates that the author likely supports affirmative action policies and views them as important measures for social justice and equal opportunity."	0.02597	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text. The author recalls the Federalist Society members' past grumbling about affirmative action, which indicates the Society's disapproval, but the author does not explicitly share their own view on the matter. The text is more focused on reporting the perspectives and influence of the Federalist Society rather than providing a personal stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text describes a gathering of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, during their 20th anniversary gala at the Mayflower Hotel. The event was attended by high-profile government officials and celebrated the Society's influence on law and policy. Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor, expressed dissatisfaction with the Bush administration's enforcement of antitrust laws, advocating for their repeal. Other attendees voiced discontent with various legal and political issues. The author reflects on the past when the Federalist Society members were students grumbling about affirmative action and the New Deal, contrasting it with their current power in shaping legal policy and selecting judges. The author notes the presence of grudges and the targeting of liberal figures, even those no longer politically active or alive. The text also comments on Kenneth Starr's speech, which criticized liberals for being result-oriented, a position the author finds ironic given Starr's own praise for conservative judicial activism. The author concludes by warning that Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans should be vigilant in reviewing judicial nominees to prevent a far-right takeover of the courts and to uphold mainstream legal principles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is implied through the mention of past interactions with the Federalist Society members. The author recalls that as law students, the members used to grumble about affirmative action, suggesting a disapproval of the policy. This recollection is presented in a context that contrasts the Society's past grievances with their current influential status, which could imply that their longstanding opposition to affirmative action is now in a position to affect change. However, the text does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action, focusing instead on reporting the Federalist Society's position and activities."	0.029339999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt	4
	None	The author, Michael Teachout, does not express a personal stance on affirmative action. Instead, he uses General Colin L. Powell's support for affirmative action as an example to counter the argument about a lack of ideological diversity in President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet. Teachout's primary concern is addressing the criticism of the cabinet's composition rather than evaluating affirmative action as a policy. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize Teachout's stance on affirmative action based on the provided text.	"Summary:
In the letter to the editor, Michael Teachout responds to the editorial critique that President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet lacks ""significant ideological diversity."" Teachout challenges the notion that diversity in beliefs is not being represented within Bush's cabinet, citing examples such as General Colin L. Powell's stance on affirmative action and Governor Christie Whitman's views on abortion, which differ from Bush's. He argues that the cabinet members align with Bush on issues relevant to their appointed positions and suggests that it is impractical for a president to appoint cabinet members with whom he cannot work effectively. Teachout also reminds readers of the balance of power inherent in the three branches of government.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Michael Teachout, does not explicitly state his personal perspective on affirmative action in the text. However, he does mention General Colin L. Powell's support for affirmative action as an example of ideological diversity within Bush's cabinet. This reference is used to argue against the claim that the cabinet lacks a range of viewpoints. Teachout's focus is on defending the president-elect's cabinet choices rather than on discussing the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.01634	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not directly address their stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The focus of the text is on criticizing the actions of the 106th Congress and Senator Ashcroft's misrepresentation of Justice Ronnie White's record. While the author disputes the false use of affirmative action as a smear tactic, they do not provide a clear opinion on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given text.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the 106th Congress, particularly the Republican leadership, for their cynical and hypocritical actions. The author highlights several instances of this behavior, including the appointment of conferees who oppose a patient rights bill, a vote to increase profits for student loan companies, and the passing of bills that undermine states' rights and environmental protections. The author is particularly appalled by the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White, an African-American Missouri Supreme Court Justice, for a federal judgeship. Republican Senator John Ashcroft led the opposition, falsely accusing White of being ""pro-criminal"" and biased against the death penalty. The author refutes these claims, noting that White has upheld many death sentences and was endorsed by Missouri police for supporting victims' rights. The author suggests that Ashcroft's true motive was to appear tough on crime for his re-election campaign and criticizes the other Republicans for supporting Ashcroft's ""cynical performance.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss their perspective on affirmative action in the provided text. However, the author does mention a case where the topic of affirmative action was falsely used by Senator Ashcroft as a reason to discredit Justice White. Ashcroft incorrectly claimed that White dissented in a case because the trial judge opposed affirmative action, which was not true. The author's focus is on exposing the falsehood and manipulation in Ashcroft's argument rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, while the author is clearly against the misuse of affirmative action as a political tool to misrepresent an individual's record, their specific views on the policy of affirmative action are not discussed in the text."	0.02645	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports the concept of affirmative action, acknowledging the importance of maintaining racial diversity. However, they critique the specific implementation in the Piscataway case as 'clumsy', suggesting a preference for more nuanced or legally sound approaches. The relief expressed over the settlement indicates a concern for the broader implications a Supreme Court ruling could have had against affirmative action. The author's nuanced view shows support for the principle of affirmative action but with caution about its application.	"Summary:
The text discusses the settlement of a lawsuit in Piscataway, N.J., where a white teacher, Sharon Taxman, was dismissed in 1989 to retain a black teacher for diversity reasons. The case had the potential to challenge affirmative-action laws in the United States. Civil rights groups intervened and contributed to the settlement to prevent the case from reaching the Supreme Court, fearing that the Court might not only rule against the specific race-based layoff but also prohibit the use of racial criteria in all employment decisions. The Piscataway case was considered a poor choice for a legal debate on affirmative action due to its unique circumstances: the teachers involved had equal seniority and qualifications, and the school district's method of promoting diversity was seen as flawed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action in principle, recognizing the goal of maintaining racial diversity in the workplace as ""honorable."" However, the author also suggests that the approach taken by the Piscataway school district was ""clumsy,"" implying that there are better ways to achieve diversity without resorting to such direct and potentially legally vulnerable methods. The author seems relieved that the case was settled before reaching the Supreme Court, which indicates a concern that a ruling in this case could have had negative implications for affirmative action policies more broadly. The author also notes that the Clinton Administration reversed its stance on the case, which may reflect the complicated nature of affirmative action and the difficulty in applying it in specific situations. Overall, the author believes that while affirmative action is important, it must be implemented carefully to withstand legal scrutiny and to be effective in promoting diversity."	0.02121	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports the concept of affirmative action but emphasizes the need for it to be applied in a manner that is consistent with legal standards and for compelling reasons. They agree that the Piscataway school board's method was improper but maintain that there are situations where affirmative action is necessary and justified. The author criticizes absolute opposition to affirmative action and highlights its value in certain contexts, such as police departments and educational institutions, for fostering racial diversity and combating discrimination. The author is not unconditionally supportive but believes in the use of affirmative action when it meets strict criteria and serves a significant public interest.	"Summary:
The Clinton Administration shifted its stance in a Supreme Court case involving the Piscataway, N.J., school board's decision to lay off a white teacher over a black teacher for the sake of racial diversity. The Administration previously supported the school board but later conceded that this action violated the white teacher's civil rights. The Administration's new brief suggests a compromise, acknowledging the school board's error while defending the broader concept of affirmative action. The Supreme Court's decision in this case could significantly impact the future use of racial preferences in public employment. The author argues that while racial quotas are not the solution, there is a compelling interest in racial diversity, such as in police departments and educational institutions, and even on the federal judiciary itself.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author supports affirmative action but with qualifications. They recognize that the Supreme Court has set strict standards for when racial preferences can be used, requiring a compelling public interest and a narrowly tailored approach. The author agrees that the Piscataway school board's actions were not narrowly tailored and did not meet the compelling interest test. However, they argue that there are legitimate and necessary cases for affirmative action, such as in police recruitment for effective community relations and in academia to teach students to work across racial lines.

The author is critical of absolutist opponents of affirmative action and warns against a color-blind approach that ignores the realities of racial discrimination. They contend that affirmative action is sometimes the only way to prevent discrimination and that recruitment efforts targeting minorities are essential for this purpose. The author also believes that racial diversity has intrinsic value in the judiciary, where it lends legitimacy to rulings on race-based state action.

In essence, the author's perspective is that while affirmative action should not be used indiscriminately, it remains an important tool for achieving racial diversity and combating discrimination in specific contexts where its use is justified and beneficial for the public interest."	0.030260000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	Timothy R. Cahn advocates for affirmative action, but with a nuanced perspective. He agrees with the need for affirmative action, not just as a response to overt discrimination, but also to correct for systemic imbalances in the university admissions process that lead to unrepresentative racial diversity in university classes. His focus on addressing systemic issues in the admissions process, rather than only overt discrimination, indicates a belief in the broader applications of affirmative action to achieve societal equity.	"Summary:
In a letter to the editor, Timothy R. Cahn addresses an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence regarding affirmative action. Cahn argues that Matsuda and Lawrence have not made the strongest case for the continuation of affirmative action policies. He suggests that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admission based on race, then the lack of proportional racial representation at universities must be due to factors other than merit. Cahn contends that affirmative action is necessary, not solely to address overt discrimination as Matsuda and Lawrence propose, but to amend the admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect the racial diversity of society.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Timothy R. Cahn, supports affirmative action but believes that the justification for it should be based on correcting imbalances in university racial representation that result from a flawed admissions process, rather than solely focusing on redressing overt discrimination. Cahn appears to hold the view that affirmative action serves to ensure that university classes are more representative of society's racial diversity, which implies that there are systemic issues in the admissions process that need to be addressed to achieve this goal."	0.01587	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Evan Edwards, expresses opposition to affirmative action by suggesting that the Republican Party's stance against it is not indicative of being anti-women. This implies that Edwards does not agree with affirmative action policies, viewing them as separate from issues of gender equality. The author's mention of the party's history of appointing women to high positions further suggests that Edwards believes in merit-based achievement without the need for affirmative action. Therefore, the author's perspective can be categorized as 'somewhat against' affirmative action, as there is a clear indication of disagreement with the policy, but the primary focus of the text is not affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The letter to the editor is a response to Frank Rich's column ""Angry White Woman,"" which discussed Tanya Melich's departure from the Republican Party. The author, Evan Edwards, criticizes Melich, calling her a ""fink"" and arguing that the Republican Party in New York City, particularly in Manhattan, is liberal to ultra-liberal, citing the formation of the New York State Conservative Party as a response to liberal Republicans. Edwards also defends the Republican Party's inclusivity by mentioning the allowance of AIDS activist Mary Fisher to speak at the 1992 convention, contrasting it with the Democrats' exclusion of Gov. Robert P. Casey's anti-abortion stance at their convention. The author points out the Republican Party's history of appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court and having women in significant roles during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Edwards argues that the Republican Party is for moderates to conservatives and that opposition to affirmative action and efforts to reduce welfare dependency do not equate to being anti-women. Lastly, Edwards suggests that Melich is better aligned with the Democratic Party, specifically as a supporter of Ruth Messinger.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Evan Edwards, expresses a clear stance against affirmative action, suggesting that the Republican Party's opposition to it does not make the party anti-women. Edwards appears to view affirmative action as a policy that the Republican Party should not support as it moves away from the party's core beliefs. The perspective presented is one that aligns with a conservative viewpoint, which often criticizes affirmative action as unnecessary government intervention or reverse discrimination. Edwards implies that the party's stance on affirmative action is a reflection of its commitment to meritocracy and individual achievement rather than a reflection of any bias against women or minorities."	0.02353	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's discussion of the need for reparations and acknowledgment of ongoing racial discrimination and systemic issues such as wage gaps, healthcare inequities, and environmental injustices indicates a strong belief in the necessity of measures to address racial inequality. The author's frustration with those who dismiss the need for affirmative action suggests a clear advocacy for its continued relevance and importance in achieving racial justice and equity. The author's stance is not neutral or against affirmative action; rather, it aligns with a perspective that strongly supports affirmative action as a crucial part of the struggle for racial equity.	"Summary:
The text discusses a hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties regarding H.R. 40, a proposal to study reparations for slavery. The hearing, which took place on Juneteenth, featured arguments from members of the black community, including Ta-Nehisi Coates. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposed reparations, arguing that measures such as civil rights legislation and the election of President Barack Obama have addressed the ""original sin of slavery"" and that it would be difficult to determine who to compensate. The author of the text challenges this perspective, citing ongoing racial discrimination and systemic issues like wage gaps, healthcare inequities, and environmental injustices, such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The author advocates for reparations as a means to acknowledge and heal the long-standing damage caused by slavery and its aftermath.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses frustration with those who believe affirmative action is no longer necessary, indicating a belief in its continued relevance in addressing systemic racial inequalities. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action is part of the broader struggle for racial justice and equity, and that it remains an important tool for correcting disparities in employment, education, and other areas. By highlighting the ""shrugging of shoulders"" and ""eye rolls"" from opponents of affirmative action, the author conveys a sense of ongoing resistance to measures designed to support the black community and other marginalized groups. The author's stance is that affirmative action, along with reparations and other forms of systemic change, is essential for acknowledging and addressing the legacy of racism and inequality that persists in American society."	0.02827	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt	4
	None	The author of the text does not directly address affirmative action policies in the contemporary sense, but reflects positively on the history of interracial unity and the distribution of leadership roles among ethnic groups in Hawaii, which he refers to as 'proto affirmative action.' This historical note suggests that the author appreciates the value of deliberate efforts to promote racial equality and integration, even though there is no explicit endorsement or critique of affirmative action policies as they are known today. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be definitively categorized based on the provided summary alone.	"Summary:
The text explores the concept of racial identity and the dynamics of diversity through the lens of the author's and Dr. Kristin Pauker's experiences. Dr. Pauker, a mixed-race psychology professor from Hawaii, faced a cultural shock at Dartmouth College due to the stark racial categorization and self-segregation. Her research in psychology investigates children's racial views in Hawaii versus the mainland U.S. and finds that Hawaiian children, including whites, do not hold essentialist views about race. The author, also of mixed heritage, examines Hawaii's history of interracial relations and labor movement, which led to a more integrated society. He discusses the potential positive impacts of diversity and mixing on reducing racism and enhancing cognitive flexibility, drawing on Dr. Pauker's studies. The article also touches on the complexities of Hawaii's racial dynamics, including prejudice against certain groups and the influence of Native Hawaiian culture and the ""aloha spirit"" on the islands' approach to race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the text provided. However, he does address the history of labor organizing in Hawaii, which he describes as ""proto affirmative action,"" where leadership positions were deliberately distributed among ethnic groups to promote interracial unity. This historical context suggests that the author views deliberate efforts to dismantle racial barriers and foster equal opportunities as a way to improve race relations in society. The author seems to support the idea that increased diversity and intentional integration can lead to more positive outcomes in terms of social cohesion and cognitive flexibility."	0.08560999999999999	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	Harry Piotrowski, the author of the third letter, appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as indicated by his critical tone when discussing the irony of Scalia's appointment to the Supreme Court. Piotrowski implies that Scalia, who opposes affirmative action, may have benefited from a similar form of selection based on his ethnic background. The author's perspective suggests that he sees a double standard in Scalia's opposition to affirmative action, but he does not explicitly endorse or oppose the policy himself. Therefore, the categorization is 'somewhat against' due to the critical nature of the comments and the focus on the perceived hypocrisy of Scalia's position on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text consists of three letters to the editor concerning the selection of a Supreme Court justice and the concept of ""ordinary Americans."" Robert B. Newlin suggests that President Obama should nominate someone who can relate to ordinary Americans and proposes non-political figures from various professional backgrounds as candidates. Richard L. Sheffield criticizes the use of the term ""ordinary"" to describe Americans, suggesting it has negative connotations and implies a sense of superiority among certain groups. Harry Piotrowski points out the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court based on ethnic background, given both men's opposition to affirmative action, and implies that Scalia believes he earned his position through merit alone.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Harry Piotrowski, the author of the third letter, expresses a critical view of affirmative action. He highlights the irony in President Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court based on his ""Italian extraction,"" which Piotrowski implies was a form of affirmative action. This is ironic because both Reagan and Scalia are characterized as viewing affirmative action negatively, as a ""wicked plot"" against a merit-based society. Piotrowski's tone suggests skepticism about Scalia's self-perception of deserving his position solely on merit, implying that his appointment was influenced by the same kind of considerations that underpin affirmative action policies. Thus, the author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it is criticized by those who may have benefited from similar considerations, revealing a potential double standard in their opposition to such policies."	0.02308	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The text summary provided does not directly address the author's stance on affirmative action. Instead, it discusses the Supreme Court's decision on the DACA program and touches upon the court's history with issues like affirmative action to illustrate the court's responsiveness to societal expectations. The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be part of a broader discussion on the court's decisions rather than a specific focus on affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined with certainty from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Supreme Court's decision regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which affects nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers. The decision was a close 5-4 vote with Chief Justice John Roberts authoring the majority opinion. The text outlines the uncertainty and anxiety felt by both DACA supporters and opponents prior to the decision, given Roberts' mixed track record on conservative issues. The administration's attempt to end DACA was deemed ""arbitrary and capricious"" due to an inadequate explanation, which did not take into account the reliance interests of the Dreamers and their families, employers, and local governments. The text also mentions other significant decisions made during the week, such as the protection of LGBTQ rights in the workplace, and reflects on the Supreme Court's historical tendency to align with public expectations. The author suggests that the court, particularly Chief Justice Roberts, sent a message that the Trump administration cannot cut corners and must not take the Supreme Court for granted. The text concludes by indicating that it's too early to define the current Supreme Court term, as more decisions on various issues are pending.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author reflects on a previous Supreme Court term under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, where the court upheld affirmative action in higher education. The author suggests that the court's decisions, including those on affirmative action, are not solely based on legal questions but also on societal expectations and the court's engagement with the public. The mention of the court upholding affirmative action is used to illustrate a broader point about the court's adaptability and responsiveness to social change, rather than to offer a detailed critique or endorsement of affirmative action policies specifically. The author seems to view affirmative action as part of a series of progressive decisions that indicate the court's willingness to align with evolving public sentiments and to protect civil rights."	0.03705	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Jennifer Lee, clearly articulates a supportive stance towards affirmative action, evidenced by her arguments against the misconceptions held by some Asian American opponents. She emphasizes that affirmative action does not impose racial quotas, which have been unconstitutional since 1978, and argues that such measures are beneficial rather than harmful to Asian Americans. Lee uses statistical evidence to show that the ban on affirmative action did not increase Asian American admissions and points out the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies in addressing inequality. She also highlights the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in leadership positions and the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes as reasons to recognize the importance of race in addressing systemic issues. Moreover, Lee encourages advocacy for affirmative action among Asian Americans, particularly at the ballot box, which demonstrates her belief in its necessity for achieving equitable opportunities and addressing historical discrimination.	"Summary:
In the text, the author discusses the upcoming vote in California on Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5), which aims to repeal Proposition 209 and restore affirmative action. Proposition 209, enacted in 1996, banned the consideration of race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, contracting, and education. The author argues against the perspective of some Asian American opponents who believe affirmative action will impose racial quotas and disadvantage their children in university admissions. The author counters this by stating that racial quotas have been unconstitutional since 1978 and that affirmative action would not harm but help Asian Americans. The text provides evidence that Proposition 209 did not increase Asian American admissions to the University of California system, and that race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial inequalities. The author also highlights the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in leadership positions across various fields despite their educational achievements. Additionally, the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes is linked to the need for recognizing the significance of race. The majority of Asian American voters, especially U.S.-born and third-generation Asians, support affirmative action, and the author calls for their advocacy at the ballot box.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jennifer Lee, a professor of sociology at Columbia University, is a proponent of affirmative action. She views ACA 5 as a means to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities. Lee argues that affirmative action is necessary to break through career ceilings and blocked mobility that Asian Americans and other marginalized groups face. She provides statistical evidence to debunk the myth that affirmative action harms Asian American admissions rates and emphasizes the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in professional advancement. Lee also points out the ineffectiveness of race-neutral policies in addressing racial realities, as evidenced by the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. She stresses the importance of understanding the origins and effects of systematic discrimination and advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure. Lee believes that affirmative action does not level the playing field but instead reinforces patterns of historic discrimination. She encourages Asian Americans to support affirmative action and to demonstrate this support in the upcoming vote."	0.033100000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of the Trump administration's stance on civil rights, including their support for lawsuits against affirmative action, indicates a disapproval of actions that undermine affirmative action policies. The call for a return to the DOJ's original mission of enforcing civil rights suggests that the author views affirmative action as an important tool within this framework. Therefore, the author seems to be in favor of affirmative action, although the text does not provide enough context to determine the degree of support unequivocally.	"Summary:
The text commemorates the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), highlighting its post-Civil War origins when it was established to professionalize legal representation of the federal government and enforce civil rights for African Americans. The author expresses concern over the DOJ's direction under President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr, criticizing their handling of civil rights issues, interference in department affairs, and leniency toward political allies. The text reflects on historical accusations of the DOJ's partisanship and suggests that reducing the scope of federal criminal law could help prevent politicization. The author calls for a return to the DOJ's founding principles of professionalism and impartiality, especially in civil rights enforcement, and sees the post-Watergate era as a positive model. The author concludes that the Trump administration has failed to uphold these values and that the task of restoring the DOJ's integrity falls to the next president and attorney general.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Trump administration's stance. They specifically mention the administration's reluctance to investigate systemic police violations and its support for lawsuits against affirmative action in college admissions. This indicates that the author views affirmative action as a component of the DOJ's civil rights mission and disapproves of the Trump administration's actions that seem to undermine it. The author advocates for a DOJ that is rededicated to its original mission, which includes the protection of civil rights, implying support for affirmative action as a means to that end."	0.023669999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's discussion of structural racism, criticism of racially polarizing politics, and the negative portrayal of Reagan's opposition to civil rights and affirmative action indicate that the author is critical of Reagan's stance and likely supports affirmative action as a means to address racial inequality. The author implies that affirmative action is necessary to counteract the effects of policies that have historically disadvantaged Black Americans and that Reagan's attempt to abolish it was detrimental to racial equality. The author's perspective aligns with the view that affirmative action is an essential tool in the fight for civil rights. Therefore, the author appears to be in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of structural racism in America, highlighted by the murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on Black Americans. It criticizes President Donald Trump for his racially polarizing approach and traces similar patterns back to former President Ronald Reagan. The author argues that Reagan used racially coded language and campaigned in ways that resonated with white voters and opposed civil rights. Reagan's political strategies included opposing the Civil Rights Act, promoting ""law and order,"" and using the ""welfare queen"" trope to appeal to white voters' fears and prejudices. The text suggests that Reagan's presidency set the stage for the racial politics that would later be seen in Trump's presidency, with Reagan's policies contributing to worsening race relations and the mass incarceration of Black Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a target of Reagan's administration, which sought to abolish it by framing it as reverse discrimination against white men. The author implies that Reagan's stance on affirmative action was part of a broader attempt to roll back the civil rights gains of the 1960s and promote a racially divisive agenda. By opposing affirmative action, Reagan's policies were seen as contributing to an assault on the progress made in achieving racial equality. The author's perspective is that Reagan's opposition to affirmative action was not only a political stance but also a reflection of his administration's overall approach to civil rights, which the author views as regressive and harmful to the cause of racial justice in America."	0.03146	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt	4
	None	The author, Melanye Price, does not directly address the broader concept of affirmative action in a general sense but focuses specifically on the selection of Kamala Harris as a vice-presidential candidate. Price argues that Harris's selection is not a result of affirmative action but rather a recognition of Black women's political power and contributions within the Democratic Party. The author's discussion centers on the political labor, voter turnout, loyalty, and grassroots efforts of Black women, which have led to their growing political influence. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action, in general, is not explicitly stated, and the discussion is confined to the context of Harris's selection, which is viewed as a deserved acknowledgment rather than an outcome of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text emphasizes the significant role Black women have played in shaping the political landscape, particularly within the Democratic Party. It highlights the political labor of Black women, their high voter turnout rates, and their loyalty to the Democratic Party, which have been instrumental in achieving historic electoral victories. Black women's grassroots organizations have been pivotal in registering new voters and motivating electoral participation without significant investment from the party. The selection of Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate is seen as a culmination of this hard work and a recognition of Black women's growing political power. The text also acknowledges the historical struggles of Black women in the fight for voting rights and their ongoing commitment to universal rights for all groups.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melanye Price, argues that viewing Kamala Harris's selection as a vice-presidential candidate through the lens of affirmative action is a mistake. Instead, Price suggests that Harris's selection is the result of the political power and sophistication of Black women within the Democratic Party. The author emphasizes that this moment is not an isolated event or a tokenistic gesture, but rather a recognition of the cumulative efforts and influence of Black women in politics. Price's perspective is that Harris's selection is a significant step forward for Black women's political ascendance and not merely a product of affirmative action. The author highlights the importance of acknowledging the political labor of Black women and their strategic efforts to make their support meaningful, rather than reducing their achievements to race and gender-based selection processes."	0.028249999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's reflection on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's influence and dedication to civil rights and gender equality suggests a positive view of Ginsburg's progressive vision, which included an understanding of systemic discrimination and the historical context of inequality. The text implies that Ginsburg, and by extension the author, appreciated the role of affirmative action in addressing these issues. The author's detailed discussion of Ginsburg's approach to affirmative action cases, which involved meticulous documentation and historical context, indicates a nuanced support for such programs. Therefore, the author likely views affirmative action as a necessary tool for achieving equality, aligning with Ginsburg's judicial philosophy.	"Summary:
The text is a personal reflection on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's influence on the author, who was inspired by Ginsburg's dedication to civil rights and gender equality. Ginsburg's vision was progressive, advocating for freedom from gender-based stereotypes and roles. She had a significant record as an advocate before the Supreme Court and was known for her incremental approach to legal change and respect for precedent. Ginsburg's decisions often included social and historical context, and she was aware of systemic discrimination. The author also discusses Ginsburg's impact on her own judicial thinking and her evolution into a more frequent dissenter as the Supreme Court's composition changed. The text concludes with a personal anecdote about Ginsburg's warmth and humor.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a nuanced supporter of affirmative action. Ginsburg recognized the persistence of racial inequity and the history of law-sanctioned inequality. In her judicial opinions, she would meticulously document the evidence of systemic discrimination, suggesting that she understood and appreciated the role of affirmative action in addressing these deep-rooted issues. Ginsburg's approach to cases involving affirmative action was to provide a detailed account of the social and historical context, indicating that she saw such programs as part of the ongoing effort to rectify centuries of inequality. The author implies that Ginsburg's perspective on affirmative action was informed by her broader commitment to equality and her understanding of the realities of discrimination in society."	0.02817	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be definitively categorized based on the provided summary, as the text primarily focuses on issues of racial injustice and police brutality, not affirmative action policy. The brief mention of affirmative action in the context of racial prejudice and African American experiences suggests an awareness of the stigmatization and misconceptions surrounding the policy. However, without explicit statements supporting or opposing affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately determine the author's stance.	"Summary:
The text discusses the decision by Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, not to charge any police officers for the killing of Breonna Taylor but instead for endangering her neighbors. The author criticizes Cameron's reference to ""mob justice"" in the context of protests against racial injustice and police brutality, highlighting the historical use of actual mob justice in the form of lynchings against African Americans in the South. The author, Melanye Price, expresses disappointment in the lack of accountability for Taylor's death and discusses the broader impact of such events on the African American community, including mistrust in government and the emotional toll of systemic racism. The piece also touches upon the personal experiences of the author with racism and the challenge of preparing for or coping with such incidents.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not directly discuss affirmative action, it does mention the topic briefly in the context of racial prejudice and the experiences of African Americans. The author recounts that African Americans often realize they are Black through negative experiences, such as being told that affirmative action is the only reason they would be admitted to a great college. This suggests that the author is aware of the stigmatization and misconceptions surrounding affirmative action and its impact on the perception of African American achievements. The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred as recognizing its necessity in addressing systemic inequalities while also being cognizant of the complexity and challenges it brings in societal perceptions of race and merit."	0.02865	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's advocacy for race-conscious admissions, criticism of the lawsuit against Yale, and commitment to defending Yale's admissions policies indicate a strong support for affirmative action. The author argues that affirmative action is necessary to maintain diversity and address historical and systemic inequalities in education. This perspective is indicative of someone who is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author, a former student-body president at Yale University, argues that despite accusations from the Trump administration, Yale has not done enough to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. The university has only recently begun to address its historical ties to slavery, and the diversity among its faculty is low. The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Yale, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants in admissions. The author highlights the importance of race-conscious admissions to maintain diversity and points out that without considering race, representation of African American and Hispanic students at elite institutions would significantly decline. The author also references the disparities in educational quality and resources among schools with different demographic compositions, which affect students' future opportunities. The author expresses a commitment to defending Yale's admissions policies and criticizes the Trump administration's actions as an attempt to reverse progress on equity in higher education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is a strong proponent of affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies. He believes that these policies are essential for creating a diverse and excellent student body at Yale and other elite institutions. The author views the lawsuit against Yale as an attack on efforts to achieve equity in higher education. He underscores the necessity of affirmative action by pointing out the historical and ongoing challenges faced by students from underrepresented backgrounds, including systemic racism and unequal access to educational resources. The author is committed to supporting and defending affirmative action, seeing it as a foundation for building a more equitable society and ensuring that underrepresented students have the opportunity to succeed and lead."	0.02612	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be strongly in favor of affirmative action. This is indicated by the reference to affirmative action as an 'equalizer' and the suggestion that it is necessary to combat systemic inequality and promote economic fairness. The author's criticism of efforts to dismantle affirmative action further underscores their support for it as a crucial mechanism to help bridge economic disparities and support the progress of African Americans.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on Donald Trump's claims that he has done more for the Black community than any other president since Abraham Lincoln. The author, an African American, expresses outrage at Trump's implication that Black people should be grateful for his efforts, likening his rhetoric to that of a slave master boasting about being kind to his slaves. The author denounces Trump's portrayal of African Americans as helpless and in need of a white savior. The text also criticizes Jared Kushner for suggesting that Black people do not want to be successful, highlighting the hypocrisy given both Trump's and Kushner's inherited wealth. The author refutes the notion that Trump is a savior by citing statistics showing that the income of affluent African Americans has been increasing since well before Trump took office. The author argues that African Americans have historically achieved success despite systemic barriers and without Trump's help.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as an ""equalizer"" intended to help bridge the economic disparity between African Americans and the rest of society. They suggest that the system has historically provided little assistance to Black people and that efforts to dismantle affirmative action are part of a broader attempt to prevent economic parity. The author's perspective is that affirmative action is a necessary tool in combating systemic inequality and promoting economic fairness, and its erosion is detrimental to the progress of African Americans."	0.0254	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The text directly addresses Richard Rodriguez's perspective on affirmative action in his autobiographical account 'Hunger of Memory.' Rodriguez is depicted as opposing affirmative action based on his personal experience, arguing that it creates a disconnect between his private life and public identity. The summary portrays his stance as nuanced and rooted in his individual cultural integration and educational journey. Therefore, the author's stance can be categorized as 'strongly against' affirmative action, given the clear opposition presented in the summary.	"Summary:

The text is a review by Phillip Lopate of five different essay collections by various authors, highlighting the themes and styles of each author. 

1. ""On the Contrary"" by Mary McCarthy is a collection of essays that challenge the conformity of the era, covering topics from politics to fashion. McCarthy is described as having a ""furiously cool, contrarian intelligence.""

2. ""The Essays of Leonard Michaels,"" edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels, showcases Michaels' fine essay writing, blending autobiographical elements with critical analysis. His Jewish immigrant background and unique English prose are highlighted.

3. ""Speak, Memory"" by Vladimir Nabokov is an autobiographical memoir that recounts his aristocratic upbringing in Russia and his later years of exile and literary development.

4. ""Hunger of Memory"" by Richard Rodriguez is an autobiographical account that presents Rodriguez's opposition to bilingual education and affirmative action, arguing from his personal experience as a ""scholarship boy.""

5. ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" by Susan Sontag includes cultural criticism and personal reflections, with essays on various intellectual figures and a more generous warmth compared to her earlier work.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

Richard Rodriguez, in ""Hunger of Memory,"" presents a perspective on affirmative action that is grounded in his personal experience. He opposes affirmative action, suggesting that it creates a distance between his private life and public identity. Rodriguez believes that while there were losses in his personal life due to his academic pursuits and assimilation into a more cultivated world, these were necessary sacrifices for his educational and professional gains. His position is portrayed as a nuanced personal stance that arises from his own journey of cultural integration and the conflict between his intimate family life and the public persona he developed through education."	0.03225	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author, Devon Westhill, expresses a clear critique of the Marin County UBI program's use of race and sex as criteria for eligibility, which aligns with his role at the Center for Equal Opportunity, an organization known for its stance against race-based affirmative action. Westhill's argument that such criteria are legally dubious and morally unjust, along with his personal anecdote, indicate a strong opposition to affirmative action policies that discriminate based on race or sex. His concern about the potential for such policies to deepen racial discord and his belief in equitable public assistance further underscore his opposition.	"Summary:
Marin County, California, is initiating a ""universal basic income"" (UBI) experiment where 125 low-income residents will receive $1,000 monthly starting in May. This initiative, partially funded by the Marin Community Foundation and the Marin County Board of Supervisors, is designed to help low-income individuals. However, unlike a similar experiment in Stockton, California, the Marin UBI program specifically targets ""mothers of color,"" excluding fathers and white mothers from eligibility. This race and sex-based selection criteria for public assistance raise legal concerns under California's equal-protection clause, which mandates strict scrutiny for racial and sex classifications, as demonstrated in the case Connerly v. State Personnel Board (2001).

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Devon Westhill, who is the president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, is critical of the Marin County UBI program's race and sex-based discrimination. He argues that using public funds to exclude individuals based on race and gender is legally dubious and morally unjust. Westhill shares a personal anecdote about how his white mother, who raised three black children in poverty, would have been excluded from the program, despite facing similar challenges as the targeted demographic. He suggests that such exclusion is the ""very definition of racial injustice.""

Westhill is concerned that the program's discriminatory nature may deepen racial discord and taint well-intentioned policies like UBI with accusations of racism. He implies that these policies, while aiming to address poverty, could be perceived as a means for reparative racial justice, which he views as problematic. Overall, Westhill's perspective is that affirmative action programs should not discriminate based on race or sex, and that public assistance should be provided equitably to all individuals in need, regardless of their demographic characteristics."	0.02631	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not directly address affirmative action in its traditional sense, which aims to support historically marginalized groups, but rather critiques a form of 'affirmative action' that benefits privileged students. The author's focus is on systemic inequities and the failure of certain systems to address racial disparities. The criticism of elite universities' practices suggests a concern for genuine equity and a desire for reforms that more effectively address class and racial disparities. The author's stance on traditional affirmative action is not made explicit, but they are critical of practices that masquerade as affirmative action while perpetuating inequality.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the media's coverage of police violence against Black citizens since George Floyd's murder, acknowledging that other systemic inequities, which also have severe consequences on Black lives, have not been as prominently addressed. The author points out that racial disparities, such as a lower life expectancy for Black men in America, often go unnoticed without viral incidents. The article criticizes the U.S. public education system's reliance on local financing, which perpetuates segregation and inequality, with wealthy, often white, students attending better-funded schools. The author mentions that attempts to address these issues, such as President Biden's proposals to invest in early childhood programs and reduce child poverty, often face reduced public support when framed as efforts to reduce racial rather than class inequality. The author suggests that the awareness raised by the Floyd case should be leveraged to address inequities in other areas, such as education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author offers a critical perspective on affirmative action as it is currently implemented in some elite universities, characterizing it as a system that disproportionately benefits privileged children, including those who are legacies or whose parents are big donors. This form of affirmative action is seen as contributing to the maintenance of an inequitable system where students from the richest 1 percent are overrepresented in comparison to those from the poorest 60 percent. The author implies that this version of affirmative action serves to reinforce existing class and racial disparities, rather than to ameliorate them."	0.03888	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be supportive, as they highlight California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality, which are core principles of affirmative action. The text specifically references the state's evolution in these areas and suggests that the progress made under Governor Newsom's leadership, including reversing discriminatory policies and ensuring equal access, aligns with the goals of affirmative action. The author's concern about the recall potentially undoing this progress further indicates their support for affirmative action policies. The portrayal of Republican recall candidates as denying racial discrimination and inequality implies that these candidates might not support affirmative action, contrasting with the author's apparent endorsement of such policies.	"Summary:
The text argues against the recall of California Governor Gavin Newsom, emphasizing that the state's values are at risk. These values include the protection of natural resources, diversity, tolerance, equality, embracing democracy, and support for the marginalized. The author believes that the leading Republican recall candidates, particularly Larry Elder, do not align with these values. The text highlights California's environmental protection efforts, its evolution into a beacon of tolerance and equality, and its expansive voting rights. Concerns are raised about the potential rollback of progress in these areas if Newsom is recalled, as the Republican candidates may not continue his policies on environmental protection, social justice, and criminal justice reform. The author suggests that the state's values are reflected in the policies enacted by elected officials like Newsom, who have been supported by a majority of Californians, and that the recall election is a test of democracy itself.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is one of support, viewing it as part of California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality. The text mentions the state's history of discriminatory policies, including an assault on affirmative action in 1996, but notes that California has since evolved to inspire the rest of the nation in these areas. The author expresses concern that the progress made under Newsom's leadership, which includes reversing discriminatory policies and ensuring equal access, might be undone if he is recalled. The leading Republican recall candidates are portrayed as denying the existence of racial discrimination and inequality, which suggests they might not uphold affirmative action principles. The author fears the state's position as a fighter against intolerance might end with Newsom's recall, implying that affirmative action and similar policies are at risk."	0.030799999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the text seems to treat affirmative action as a politically problematic issue for Democrats, suggesting that while it is important to the liberal base, it does not resonate as strongly with the broader electorate, including voters of color. The author's perspective appears to align with David Shor's pragmatic approach, which implies that affirmative action, among other issues, may not be the best focal point for winning elections. This perspective indicates a concern for the electoral viability of affirmative action rather than its moral or social merits, placing the author in a position that does not strongly advocate for or against the policy itself but rather considers its political implications.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of perceived liberal media bias and its impact on politics, particularly from a conservative viewpoint. The author reflects on the idea that while Republicans often complain about this bias, it might actually be more detrimental to Democrats. The column by Ezra Klein about progressive election analyst David Shor is cited, where Shor argues that the left-leaning newsrooms and campaign staff focus on issues that excite them but are politically toxic, such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action. These issues do not resonate with the broader electorate, including voters of color, as much as expected.

The author contrasts Shor's pragmatic approach of prioritizing popular ideas with progressive strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio's belief that messaging should aim to make important issues popular. The author suggests that Democrats need to understand what voters already want instead of trying to align diverse voter interests under a single narrative.

The author also points out that the insular nature of left-leaning media could create a bubble that reinforces unpopular progressive slogans and makes it difficult for Democrats to shift away from divisive politics. The media's focus on identity politics during the Hillary Clinton campaign is used as an example. The text concludes by warning that catering to a highly educated class can be electorally risky for Democrats, as it alienates the majority who do not have a bachelor's degree. The media, sharing the same biases, may inadvertently contribute to this disconnect.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents affirmative action as an example of a well-intentioned policy that has not gained the popularity among voters of color that was expected. According to the perspective shared in the text, affirmative action is one of the issues that excites the liberal activist base but does not resonate with the broader electorate, including those it aims to benefit. The author suggests that while affirmative action is championed by the left, it could be politically disadvantageous and contribute to the Democratic Party's challenges in connecting with a wider range of voters. The text implies that the author agrees with Shor's analysis that focusing on issues like affirmative action may not be the most effective strategy for Democrats seeking to win elections."	0.033159999999999995	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to support the concept of affirmative action as a means to correct past injustices and promote equality, aligning with the traditional liberal view of providing equal opportunities. This stance is evident from their reference to Lyndon B. Johnson's policies, which they label as sensible. However, they are critical of what they perceive as a radical shift in the approach to affirmative action, particularly the ideas presented by Ibram X. Kendi, which they argue departs from the original intent of affirmative action by calling for ongoing discrimination as a remedy. The author's support for the original principles of affirmative action suggests they are 'somewhat in favor' of it, but their criticism of the newer interpretations implies a nuanced view that does not fully embrace all forms of affirmative action being discussed in contemporary politics.	"Summary:
The author, who has been a political commentator for over twenty years, expresses deep disillusionment with the current state of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. Initially a Democrat, the author became an independent while working as a reporter and has maintained that stance due to discomfort with increasing political tribalism and skepticism about government as a cure-all. Although the author has voted across party lines, they now feel alienated by the extreme ideologies dominating both parties.

The author criticizes the Republican Party for its alignment with Donald Trump, suggesting it threatens the foundation of the republic by undermining election integrity, condoning insurrection, and promoting an exclusionary definition of Americanism based on race and heritage. On the other hand, the author also condemns the Democratic Party for abandoning traditional liberalism and embracing a radical form of identity politics that prioritizes retribution over equality and free expression. The author references Ibram X. Kendi's book ""How to Be an Antiracist"" as emblematic of this shift, arguing that Kendi's call for discrimination as a remedy is a departure from the affirmative action policies of the past and is not in line with the author's understanding of liberalism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views traditional affirmative action, as exemplified by the policies of Lyndon B. Johnson, as sensible and aligned with their understanding of liberalism. They see it as a means to correct past injustices and promote equality. However, the author disagrees with Ibram X. Kendi's interpretation, which they perceive as advocating for ongoing discrimination as a remedy for both past and present injustices. The author believes that this approach is not constructive and is indicative of a broader issue within the Democratic Party, which they feel has strayed from the core liberal principles of equal opportunity and individual merit. The author implies that affirmative action should be about leveling the playing field rather than perpetuating a cycle of discrimination based on identity."	0.04093	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt	4
	None	The provided summary does not explicitly mention affirmative action, and the focus is primarily on the author's opposition to hate crime legislation and concerns about free speech implications. The author's perspective on hate speech legislation and the potential for government overreach suggests a preference for individual liberties and a wariness of government policies that categorize certain types of speech or beliefs as punishable. While there is an indirect implication that the author might be critical of affirmative action if it were to be associated with hate speech, there is not enough direct evidence in the summary to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action definitively. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers for hate crimes, arguing that punishing individuals for their thoughts or beliefs is a step towards totalitarianism. The author notes that while the murderers' actions were indeed racially motivated, the additional federal conviction for hate crimes is seen as unnecessary and constitutionally dubious, as the state court had already convicted and sentenced them for murder. The author argues against the idea of government punishing individuals for their beliefs, suggesting that doing so could lead to a slippery slope where more types of thoughts or speech could be criminalized. The text also touches on the broader implications of hate speech legislation and the potential for overreach by the government into regulating speech and thoughts, drawing comparisons with European laws that allow for the sanctioning or prevention of speech that spreads hatred.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Although the text does not primarily focus on affirmative action, the author appears to be critical of policies and actions, including opposition to race-based affirmative action, being labeled as ""hate speech."" The author's perspective suggests a disapproval of the concept of hate speech being used to encompass expressions of ideas that may offend certain groups, including those that oppose affirmative action. This indicates that the author likely views affirmative action through a critical lens, especially when its opposition is categorized as potentially offensive or hateful speech. The text implies the author's concern that such categorization could lead to the suppression of free speech and the punishment of individuals for their beliefs or attitudes, which could include those related to affirmative action."	0.028020000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the evolution of Justice O'Connor's stance on affirmative action, from initial opposition to support as evidenced by her majority opinion upholding it. The author views affirmative action positively, emphasizing the potential influence of Judge Jackson's diverse background on the Supreme Court. The discussion of diversity beyond race and the importance of varying perspectives suggests that the author appreciates the role of affirmative action in promoting such diversity within the judiciary. The author's criticism of the conservative focus on race and the positive framing of Judge Jackson's experiences imply a supportive stance toward affirmative action.	"Summary:
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote an essay in 1992 expressing admiration for Justice Thurgood Marshall's storytelling and the inspiration it provided, which was surprising given her initial opposition to affirmative action and federal oversight of state criminal justice. However, by her retirement in 2006, O'Connor's views had shifted, and she authored the majority opinion upholding affirmative action in university admissions. The essay reflects on whether President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, could similarly influence her future colleagues. It highlights Jackson's background, including her public school education, her role as a public defender, and her shared professional trajectory with Justice Breyer. The essay argues for a broader appreciation of diversity beyond race and suggests that Jackson's life story and perspective could potentially influence the conservative majority on the Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author initially presents Justice O'Connor as someone who opposed affirmative action and was aligned with states' rights. However, the author notes that O'Connor's perspective evolved over time, and she eventually wrote the opinion preserving affirmative action, suggesting that she was possibly influenced by Justice Marshall's stories and legacy. The author seems to view affirmative action positively, as evidenced by the discussion of Judge Jackson's potential impact on the Court and the importance of diversity in its many dimensions. The author criticizes the narrow focus on race by conservative groups and underscores the significance of having different backgrounds and experiences, such as Jackson's, represented on the Supreme Court. The author's perspective indicates a belief in the value of affirmative action and diversity in shaping the views and decisions of the judiciary."	0.04965000000000001	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, David Bernstein, does not directly state his position on affirmative action in the provided summary. However, he emphasizes the importance of discussing different perspectives and encouraging open debate on contentious topics, including affirmative action. While he criticizes the right for trying to ban critical race theory and the left for offering a singular perspective, he does not explicitly align with or oppose affirmative action. Instead, he advocates for a balanced educational approach that presents multiple viewpoints. Based on this, we cannot conclusively categorize his stance on affirmative action as he appears to be more concerned with the method of teaching about it rather than the policy itself.	"Summary:
David Bernstein discusses the polarized debate over teaching race and racism in American schools. He criticizes the right for attempting to ban critical race theory (CRT) and the left for teaching a singular perspective on systemic racism without room for debate. Bernstein shares his personal experience with his children's education in Montgomery County Public Schools, which he finds to be prescriptive and closed to alternative viewpoints. His son has expressed frustration with being unable to voice differing opinions in class discussions. Bernstein argues for a balanced educational approach that includes multiple perspectives on American history, including both the ""1619"" and ""1776"" narratives, and the works of various scholars who offer different explanations for racial disparities in America.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Bernstein's perspective on affirmative action is not overtly stated in the text, but he expresses concern about the lack of open discussion and debate on the topic. He criticizes the Virginia governor's executive order for potentially prohibiting teaching about affirmative action due to its vague wording, which could deter important classroom conversations. Bernstein suggests that teaching about affirmative action should involve exploring various sides of the debate, including Supreme Court decisions and the broader discourse surrounding racial preferences. He advocates for an educational approach that exposes students to a range of ideas and allows them to form their own opinions, which implies that he supports a nuanced and critical examination of affirmative action rather than a one-sided portrayal."	0.03029	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt	4
	None	The text does not directly address affirmative action, making it impossible to categorically determine the author's stance on the topic. The authors' concerns focus on the potential rollback of civil rights and protections for marginalized groups following the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade. Michael D. Abell's fear of undoing civil rights legislation could imply a concern for the future of affirmative action, but without explicit statements on affirmative action, it is speculative to assign a definitive stance.	"Summary:
The provided text contains a series of opinions expressed by various authors in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The authors express concerns about the implications of this decision for other rights and legal protections. Linda Linton worries about the future of the country, fearing the rise of a Christian nation and the potential loss of rights for women, LGBTQ individuals, and the impact on states' rights. Michael D. Abell sees the decision as a victory for Southern states and a potential gateway to undoing civil rights legislation, fearing a return to an era of segregation and discrimination. George Miller discusses the potential threat to Title IX, which protects against sex-based discrimination in education, due to the court's rationale in overturning Roe v. Wade. Julie Thostenson, on the other hand, presents a contrasting view on pregnancy and personal responsibility, suggesting that individuals should abstain from intercourse if they do not wish to have children.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action, it is clear that the authors are concerned about the potential rollback of various civil rights, which could include affirmative action. The fear expressed by Michael D. Abell about the potential undoing of civil rights legislation indicates a worry that affirmative action, along with other rights, could be threatened by the current trajectory of the Supreme Court. The overall tone of the responses suggests a belief that the court's decisions may lead to a reduction in protections for historically marginalized groups, which would include the protections offered by affirmative action policies."	0.025619999999999997	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Renu Mukherjee, criticizes affirmative action for not capturing the full spectrum of diversity and suggests that race-neutral admissions policies could be more effective. The emphasis on the limitations of affirmative action and the advocacy for race-neutral alternatives indicates a stance that is critical of current affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court is set to hear challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill. Public opinion on affirmative action is divided, with many states banning the practice and surveys indicating that a majority of Americans oppose considering race in college admissions. Justin Driver suggests a middle path that allows institutions to transition to race-neutral admissions, referencing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion from Grutter v. Bollinger that racial preferences might not be necessary in the future. Linda Greenhouse discusses the enduring debate over the implications of Brown v. Board of Education, while Renu Mukherjee criticizes affirmative action for not recognizing the full scope of diversity and advocates for race-neutral alternatives. These essays provide insight into the future of higher education and the Supreme Court's direction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Renu Mukherjee, takes a critical stance against affirmative action. She believes that affirmative action is not effective in advancing true diversity on college campuses and that it overlooks other forms of diversity not related to race. Mukherjee champions race-neutral admission policies as a better method to create diverse educational environments, drawing from her personal experience to argue that diversity can be multifaceted and not solely dependent on race-conscious programs. Mukherjee's perspective suggests that affirmative action may be outdated and that institutions should focus on broader, more inclusive approaches to diversity."	0.02726	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors express concern over the Supreme Court's potential reversal of affirmative action and imply that such a move would be a departure from the Court's historical commitment to civil rights, including the principles stemming from the Brown v. Board of Education decision. They suggest that the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court may undo gains won for civil rights causes, which indicates that the authors view affirmative action as a positive and necessary remedy for historical injustices. This perspective shows that the authors are in favor of affirmative action, as they are worried about its potential reversal and view it as part of the progress towards civil rights.	"Summary:
The text discusses the 2022 year-end report on the federal judiciary by Chief Justice John Roberts, noting its lack of commentary on several pressing issues surrounding the Supreme Court. The report begins by recalling the historical moment of desegregation in the 1950s and the threats faced by judges at the time, drawing a parallel to the dangers judges face today. Roberts commends Congress for passing a law to protect judges' personal information. However, the report does not address recent controversies, such as the lack of recusal requirements for justices, the leak of a draft decision on abortion rights, or questions about financial disclosure and fundraising. The report also highlights a decline in federal court use, with a significant drop in appellate filings and federal district court civil cases. This decline is attributed to the Supreme Court's decisions over the past decades, which have made it harder for individuals to litigate, especially in class-action lawsuits and cases involving arbitration clauses. An exception to this trend is the litigation by military service members and veterans against 3M for faulty combat earplugs, which was allowed to proceed in court. The authors argue that Congress needs to act to ensure the right to bring cases to court, as it did with the amendment to the 1925 arbitration statute for victims of sexual assault and harassment.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors express concern about the Supreme Court's potential reversal of affirmative action in school admissions. They highlight that affirmative action is one of the remedies that stemmed from the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which the Supreme Court of 1954 fully supported and reaffirmed in 1958. The authors indicate that the current Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roberts appears to be moving away from the principles that once led federal courts to protect civil rights and ensure court accessibility to all. They suggest that the court's conservative majority may extinguish gains won for various civil rights causes, including affirmative action. The authors imply that the Supreme Court's current stance is a departure from its historical commitment to civil rights and opening doors for marginalized groups."	0.03544	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author, William McGurn, is critical of affirmative action policies as implemented in the context of Northern Virginia public schools. He describes these policies as a 'war on achievement' and suggests that they disadvantage high-achieving Asian-American students. McGurn cites the demographic changes at TJ and the suppression of individual achievements in the name of equal outcomes as evidence of the negative impact of these policies. His use of phrases like 'war on achievement' indicates a strong opposition to the current implementation of affirmative action in this context.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding the failure of several high schools in Northern Virginia to notify students of their recognition by the National Merit Scholarship Program. The issue was brought to light by Asra Nomani, and has led to a civil-rights investigation by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares. The context suggests that this oversight might be part of a broader equity agenda in Fairfax County public schools, which has been criticized for discriminating against high-achieving students, particularly those of Asian-American descent. The article highlights a shift in the demographics of admitted students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ) following changes in admissions policies aimed at increasing African-American and Hispanic representation at the expense of Asian-American students. It also references a consultant's presentation that defines equity as ""equal outcomes for every student, without exception,"" which some believe undermines individual achievements.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, William McGurn, appears to be critical of affirmative action policies, particularly as they are implemented in the context of the Northern Virginia public schools. McGurn suggests that these policies have evolved from well-intentioned efforts to prevent discrimination into a ""war on achievement"" that particularly disadvantages high-achieving Asian-American students. He cites the changes in the demographics of the admitted class at TJ following the elimination of a merit-based entrance exam as evidence of this shift. The author also implies that the equity agenda, as pursued by the school officials, is not only about promoting fairness but also about suppressing the achievements of certain groups to achieve equal outcomes. McGurn's perspective is that these policies and practices are not only unfair to high-achieving students but also counterproductive, as they seem to foster resentment and distrust among parents and students."	0.02948	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author, Vivek Ramaswamy, expresses a clear opposition to affirmative action, advocating for its complete elimination and the prosecution of what he considers illegal race-based preferences. He criticizes affirmative action for undermining meritocracy and fostering resentment, and he plans to rescind Executive Order 11246, which mandates race-based hiring preferences for federal contractors. His stance is rooted in the belief that America should focus on merit-based systems to strengthen its national identity and principles.	"Summary:
Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old co-founder of Strive Asset Management and author, expresses his concerns about America's national identity crisis. He argues that traditional values such as faith, patriotism, and hard work are declining, and that people are turning to ""secular religions"" to find meaning. Ramaswamy criticizes the Republican Party for not providing a compelling alternative to the ""woke agenda"" and announces his presidential run to establish a new American Dream centered on the unapologetic pursuit of excellence.

Ramaswamy advocates for a merit-based approach to immigration, education, employment, and governance. He intends to secure the border, end lottery-based immigration, and promote a system that favors skilled and law-abiding immigrants. He is also committed to overturning affirmative action, rescinding Executive Order 11246, and prosecuting illegal race-based preferences. In government, he plans to fire unelected bureaucrats who overstep their authority and reform federal agencies.

He emphasizes the importance of free speech, proposing to protect political expression as a civil right and release government files that show attempts to pressure tech companies into censorship. Ramaswamy also outlines his stance on foreign policy, particularly the need to confront the rise of China by achieving economic independence, energy leadership, semiconductor self-sufficiency, and holding China accountable for its actions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ramaswamy takes a strong stance against affirmative action, viewing it as detrimental to the principle of merit. He criticizes the policy for creating resentment and condescension towards certain racial groups and argues that it disfavors qualified applicants based on race. He believes that affirmative action undermines the pursuit of excellence and meritocracy in America. As president, he would work to eliminate affirmative action across the American economy, starting with rescinding Executive Order 11246, which mandates race-based hiring preferences for federal contractors. He also intends to direct the Justice Department to prosecute what he considers illegal race-based preferences. Ramaswamy's perspective is that by reviving merit-based systems, America can strengthen its national identity and principles."	0.03361	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of the Supreme Court's handling of affirmative action, as part of a broader pattern of judicial activism and subversion of democratic principles, indicates that they are concerned with the Court's approach to this issue. They imply that the Court's decisions on affirmative action are driven by a right-wing political agenda rather than consistent legal reasoning. The author's call for reform measures to reduce the Court's overreach suggests a desire to protect affirmative action policies from being undermined by the Court's current conservative majority. The text does not explicitly state the author's personal stance on affirmative action, but their criticism of the Court's right-wing activism implies they are opposed to the Court's handling of affirmative action cases, which suggests they are likely in favor of affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The author criticizes the current U.S. Supreme Court for its perceived departure from traditional judicial standards and for acting as a partisan political entity rather than an impartial judicial body. They argue that the Court has been overturning established laws, impacting areas such as women's health, college admissions, student aid, and public accommodations, thereby undermining democracy. The author points out that the justices refuse to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which further erodes their legitimacy. The Court is accused of disregarding legal doctrines such as stare decisis, creating standing where there is none, and using the ""major questions doctrine"" as a pretext to enforce a right-wing agenda. The author suggests that the public is aware of the Court's partisanship, citing polls reflecting a belief that the Court's decisions are politically motivated. They advocate for reform measures like term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion, and ethics reform to preserve democracy and reduce the Court's overreach.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as one of several areas where the Supreme Court has made decisions that are offensive to many Americans. They argue that the Court's handling of affirmative action is part of a broader pattern of activism that subverts democratic principles and self-government. The author implies that the Court's approach to affirmative action is not based on consistent legal reasoning but rather on a right-wing political agenda. They criticize the Court for casting aside legal precedents without acknowledging it and for muscling its way to desired outcomes. The author's perspective is that the Supreme Court's actions regarding affirmative action and other policies are illegitimate and representative of the Court's transformation into a supreme right-wing policymaker rather than an arbiter of the law."	0.035019999999999996	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern about the Supreme Court's decision to end affirmative action and its potential negative impact on students of color. They indicate that affirmative action has been beneficial in the past and imply that it continues to be relevant. The mention of the innkeeper's dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's ruling suggests a critical view of the decision to end affirmative action. This indicates that the author is supportive of affirmative action, though they also acknowledge the changing landscape of education and work due to AI. The author does not express an unequivocal, strong support for affirmative action, but rather a nuanced understanding of its role in the current context.	"Summary:
The text discusses the implications of the Supreme Court's decision to end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions, especially in the context of the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market. The author suggests that as AI begins to replace white-collar jobs, the value of a traditional college education is diminishing. They propose that future job preparation might focus more on physical and outdoor work, which AI cannot perform. The author also touches on the emotional and creative aspects that AI lacks, which still gives humans an edge in certain professions. The piece reflects on the impact of AI on various professions, including writing, and how some clients are returning to human writers for quality content. The author expresses concern about the potential effects on academia, particularly on students of color who might have benefited from affirmative action policies, and speculates on the future composition of college enrollments.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a policy that has historically helped students of color gain access to higher education. They express concern about the immediate impact of the Supreme Court's decision on these students, suggesting that it could lead to a decrease in diversity within colleges and universities. The author also implies that the end of affirmative action might contribute to a broader trend of diminishing college enrollments, particularly among young men and potentially among Black and Brown students. The author seems to believe that affirmative action still has relevance and is needed, as evidenced by the closing anecdote where a local innkeeper wishes the Supreme Court was an AI chatbot, indicating dissatisfaction with the ruling. Overall, the author's perspective suggests a belief in the continued importance of affirmative action in an evolving educational and professional landscape shaped by AI."	0.0315	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The text summary does not provide a direct statement or clear opinion from the author specifically on affirmative action. It focuses on reader responses to an op-ed about a Supreme Court case concerning discrimination and religious freedom. While the author mentions the 'gutting of affirmative action' in the context of the Court's decisions, this reference is too vague to determine the author's stance on affirmative action. It only suggests that the author might view recent Court actions as negative towards affirmative action, but without a direct statement or argument from the author about affirmative action itself, we cannot accurately categorize their stance.	"Summary:
The text provided includes various opinions from readers in response to an op-ed by Amanda Katz regarding the Supreme Court's ruling in the 303 Creative v. Elenis case. The case involved a web designer who refused to provide services for same-sex weddings, citing religious beliefs. Michael D. Schattman mocks the Court's decision, suggesting it's based on a hypothetical scenario. Kathy Viney criticizes the use of religious freedom to justify discrimination. Ravin Bhatia expresses fear for the future of LGBTQ+ rights, given the Court's recent decisions. Aimée La Fountain is baffled by the case's basis on a ""what if"" scenario and hopes for legal action against misrepresentation. David Dorsen points out the complexity of the ruling and its potentially broad implications.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context of the Supreme Court's recent decisions, which are mentioned to include the ""gutting of affirmative action."" This suggests that the author likely views the Court's actions as detrimental to the principles of affirmative action, which are intended to promote equal opportunities for historically marginalized groups. The mention of the Court's track record, including the undermining of federal abortion protections, further implies that the author is critical of the Court's conservative rulings and their impact on social justice and equality."	0.02302	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	Ibert Schultz, based on the summary provided, seems to be an advocate for affirmative action, seeing it as a necessary measure to combat systemic inequalities in education. Schultz highlights the challenges faced by Black students in accessing higher education and suggests that the ban on affirmative action has had negative consequences, such as a decline in Black student enrollment. The author's work through a nonprofit that assists Black students further indicates a commitment to addressing educational disparities, which affirmative action aims to mitigate. Therefore, the author's perspective can be categorized as being strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action and the shift to a ""colorblind"" college admissions process, particularly highlighting the experiences in California post-Proposition 209. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit that helps Black students from South Los Angeles access higher education. Schultz describes the challenges faced by these students, many of whom are from low-income families and would be the first in their families to attend college. Despite the odds, the organization has celebrated successes, including helping students gain admission to prestigious universities and win scholarships. The text outlines the comprehensive support provided by Black College Success, from academic planning to college application assistance. Schultz emphasizes that student determination, along with guidance and academics, is crucial for success. However, there is concern that the elimination of affirmative action will reduce opportunities for Black students and be detrimental to society as a whole.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Ibert Schultz appears to view affirmative action as a necessary tool for addressing systemic inequalities in education and ensuring that students from marginalized communities, particularly Black students, have access to higher education opportunities. Schultz cites the decline in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities following the ban on affirmative action in California as evidence of the policy's importance. The author is worried that a colorblind admissions process will overlook the unique challenges and experiences of Black applicants, leading to a decrease in their educational opportunities. Schultz's work with Black College Success is rooted in the belief that targeted support can help overcome the barriers these students face, but there is an underlying implication that such efforts are made more difficult without affirmative action policies in place. Overall, Schultz's perspective suggests that affirmative action is a beneficial and necessary policy for creating a more equitable and diverse educational environment."	0.03005	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author presents a balanced view of the situation at UC Irvine, discussing the institution's efforts to promote diversity and the controversy surrounding affirmative action without revealing a personal stance. The mention of the Diversity Council and the university's engagement with diversity suggests a positive view of diversity initiatives. However, the author's own perspective on affirmative action is not clearly stated. They provide information on both the university's pro-diversity actions and the criticism from figures like Ward Connerly. The text concludes by noting the broader community's support for inter-ethnic dialogue, which might imply a favorable view of diversity efforts but does not directly translate to a stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
UC Irvine has been actively engaging its academic community in discussions about diversity for over eight months under the leadership of Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. The university is preparing to establish a Diversity Council to further support and promote diversity within the institution. This initiative comes at a time when a University of California regent, Ward Connerly, has publicly criticized affirmative action and seeks to end race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. UCI has been recognized for its off-campus diversity efforts, such as engaging with high school students and alumni involvement in community projects like the creation of a cultural mural. On-campus, UCI boasts a high percentage of Asian students and hosts events to celebrate cultural differences. However, the university acknowledges the need for improvement in hiring and promoting a more diverse faculty. Chancellor Wilkening views diversity as a strength and an attractive feature of UCI, a sentiment echoed by Orange County residents who recognize the importance of programs that foster inter-ethnic dialogue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action. However, they report on the current state of affairs at UC Irvine and the broader community's engagement with diversity and affirmative action issues. The author mentions the controversy surrounding these topics, highlighted by Ward Connerly's opposition to affirmative action. The text suggests that while the university values diversity and is taking steps to promote it, there is a recognition that affirmative action and diversity are complex and often intertwined issues that elicit strong opinions and heated debates. The broader community sentiment, as captured in the Orange County Annual Survey, indicates a strong support for programs that increase dialogue among ethnic groups, suggesting a general favorability towards efforts that aim to enhance diversity and potentially affirmative action as a means to that end."	0.024360000000000003	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the focus of the text, and the author does not provide a clear stance on the issue. They simply report on Colin Powell's position, stating that Powell 'supports some affirmative action.' Since the author does not elaborate on their own views or engage in a discussion about the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action, it is not possible to categorize their stance on the topic. The text is more focused on the political climate and Colin Powell's potential candidacy than on the issue of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the lack of public enthusiasm for the major-party nominees in the upcoming presidential campaign, with Bill Clinton and Republican contenders like Bob Dole and Phil Gramm failing to excite the electorate. The author attributes this to a broader dissatisfaction with the political class, ideological oversimplifications, and a sense that the political process is flawed. Amid this backdrop, retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell is gaining attention as he promotes his memoirs, which is also being viewed as a potential political move. Powell, who is yet to outline his political stance fully, appears to hold moderate views on domestic issues, which may not align with the typical GOP base. However, the author notes that there is a public desire for an alternative to the traditional two-party offerings and that Powell's character could be a strong selling point, suggesting that a Powell candidacy could potentially reinvigorate a disenchanted public.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly mentions Colin Powell's stance on several issues, including affirmative action, stating that Powell ""supports some affirmative action."" The author does not delve deeply into the topic or provide their own perspective on affirmative action but instead presents it as one of the various political positions held by Powell. The mention of Powell's support for ""some affirmative action"" implies that Powell may take a nuanced or moderate approach to the policy, which aligns with the author's depiction of Powell as a moderate on the political spectrum."	0.02298	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's positive view of affirmative action is inferred from the context in which it is mentioned—alongside anti-immigration sentiments and as part of the political climate the author criticizes. The author's personal experiences with racism and the appreciation for the contributions of Mexican American leaders suggest support for policies that foster inclusion and diversity. However, since the text does not provide explicit statements of strong advocacy or opposition to affirmative action, the author's stance is best categorized as 'somewhat in favor' rather than 'strongly in favor'.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the celebration of Cinco de Mayo in California, a holiday that commemorates an underdog victory of Mexican forces over the French in 1862. The author notes the irony of celebrating a Mexican holiday in light of California's then-current political climate, with anti-immigration sentiments and challenges to affirmative action. Despite this, the author expresses a deep connection to California, contrasting it with a love-hate relationship with Texas due to overt racism experienced there. The text also touches on the cultural impact of California on Texas, particularly during the 1950s, and the author's admiration for Californian leaders of Mexican descent who have made significant contributions to the state. The author, a Northern California writer, concludes by embracing a Californian identity and the significance of Cinco de Mayo.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action in a positive light and seems to be critical of the initiatives against it. The mention of the ""anti-affirmative action initiative"" alongside Proposition 187, which was known for its anti-immigration stance, suggests that the author sees these measures as regressive and harmful to the social fabric of California. The author's personal experiences with racism in Texas and the appreciation for the contributions of Mexican American leaders in California imply a belief in the importance of policies that promote inclusion and diversity. The author's connection to California's multicultural heritage and the mention of influential leaders of Mexican descent who have shaped the state indicate a belief that affirmative action may play a role in creating opportunities and recognizing the contributions of historically marginalized groups."	0.02872	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critical view of the political maneuvering that has influenced affirmative action policy within the University of California system suggests a supportive stance towards the policy itself. The emphasis on the need for leadership to navigate the university effectively without getting caught up in political disputes, and the highlighting of the negative impacts of these political battles on students and the university's mission to address race bias and support underprivileged students, indicate that the author believes in the principles of affirmative action. The criticism is directed at the political motivations and actions of the UC Board of Regents, Governor Pete Wilson, and Richard C. Atkinson, rather than the concept of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political controversies surrounding the University of California system, particularly in relation to affirmative action policies. In 1967, UC President Clark Kerr was fired by Governor Ronald Reagan, which led to backlash from the Faculty Senate and students. Nearly 30 years later, the UC system faced similar turmoil when the Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring, a move seen as politically motivated to aid Governor Pete Wilson's presidential campaign. The decision was widely opposed by chancellors, student governments, and the Faculty Senate, which argued it violated the principle of shared governance.

Richard C. Atkinson was appointed as the new UC president during this period of tension and was tasked with implementing the new policy. Despite his support for affirmative action, Atkinson delayed the policy's full implementation, leading to a confrontation with the regents who demanded adherence to their directive. Atkinson eventually apologized and agreed to expedite the implementation.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the political maneuvering that has impacted the policy's implementation within the UC system. The author seems to support the idea of affirmative action, emphasizing the need for leaders who can guide the university effectively into the future without getting bogged down in political disputes. The author suggests that the regents' decision, while constitutionally supported, was politically charged, and that Atkinson's response, although also political, aimed to maintain affirmative action principles. The text underscores the negative impact these political battles have on students and the university's ability to address systematic race bias and support underprivileged students.

Author's Perspective:
The author appears to be in favor of affirmative action as a means to address systematic race bias and to support underprivileged students of all races. The author criticizes the political motivations behind the actions of both the UC Board of Regents and Governor Pete Wilson, as well as the bureaucratic resistance from Richard C. Atkinson. The perspective conveyed is that the political infighting is detrimental to the university's mission to educate students and that leadership should focus on creating a fair and effective educational system rather than engaging in power struggles."	0.0337	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action. This categorization is based on the author's critique of the policy's limitations, such as its focus on redistributing existing opportunities rather than creating new ones and potentially benefiting well-off individuals within minority groups over disadvantaged individuals from majority groups. The author also expresses concern that affirmative action does not address the root causes of inequality. Despite the critical view, the author acknowledges the historical context of discrimination and the need for inclusion, suggesting a nuanced critique rather than outright opposition. The call for a balanced debate and a broader discussion of equality of opportunity for all disadvantaged individuals further indicates a perspective that is critical of affirmative action in its current form but not entirely dismissive of its intentions or the need for policies that promote inclusion and address historical injustices.	"Summary:
The text is a critique of affirmative action, highlighting its limitations and the complexities surrounding its implementation. The author argues that affirmative action redistributes existing opportunities rather than expanding them, leading to a zero-sum game. It is contrasted with traditional redistributive programs that target individuals based on their conditions (e.g., unemployment, poverty) rather than their race or gender. The author suggests that affirmative action does not address the root causes of inequality and may not always be just, as it can sometimes benefit the well-off within minority groups over disadvantaged individuals from majority groups. The text acknowledges the historical context of discrimination in the United States and the need for inclusion of African Americans at all societal levels. It also recognizes the potential negative perceptions of dismantling affirmative action. The author calls for a balanced debate that honors both sides of the argument and suggests that a blue-ribbon commission on affirmative action should focus on broader discussions of equality of opportunity for all disadvantaged individuals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical but nuanced. They see affirmative action as a flawed approach that does not address broader socio-economic disparities and instead focuses on reallocating existing opportunities among different demographic groups. The author believes that affirmative action can sometimes lead to unjust outcomes, such as favoring affluent individuals within minority groups over more disadvantaged individuals from majority groups.

However, the author also acknowledges the unique and persistent challenges faced by African Americans due to historical and ongoing discrimination, suggesting that the abandonment of affirmative action could be perceived as a rejection by society. The perspective presented is that while affirmative action has its issues, the debate around it should be thoughtful and considerate of the various ""truths"" held by both supporters and opponents.

The author advocates for a more comprehensive approach to achieving equality of opportunity that addresses the root causes of inequality and supports all those in need, regardless of race or gender. They suggest that any commission on affirmative action should aim to broaden the conversation to include how society can ensure more equitable opportunities for everyone, particularly for those in the inner city and children of modest means."	0.03476	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author appears to have a complex view on affirmative action. They acknowledge both the benefits and the drawbacks of the policy. The author appreciates the positive aspects of affirmative action, such as promoting diversity and addressing past injustices, as seen in their recognition of the program's impact and their admiration for The Washington Post's efforts towards diversity. However, they also express concerns about the potential for creating tension, discomfort, and a sense of unfairness among those who feel they are negatively impacted by such policies. The author's suggestion to move away from numerical goals towards a principle of absolute nondiscrimination indicates a preference for merit-based success without the imposition of quotas. This perspective shows an understanding of the complexities of affirmative action without outright rejecting or fully endorsing it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding an article by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic, which criticized The Washington Post's affirmative action policies. The article suggested that The Post had lowered its hiring and news coverage standards to meet affirmative action goals, leading to ""racial strife."" The Post's editor, Leonard Downie Jr., and publisher, Donald E. Graham, vehemently denied these allegations, defending the newspaper's commitment to quality and diversity without compromising standards. The author reflects on the broader implications of affirmative action in a time of economic insecurity, acknowledging the program's benefits but also recognizing its potential to create tension among different demographic groups. The author admires The Post's efforts towards diversity but suggests that the focus should be on nondiscrimination rather than meeting numerical goals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses a nuanced view on affirmative action. They recognize that affirmative action was conceived in a time of economic growth and that its aim to consider race or sex in hiring and promotion challenges the American ideal of merit-based success. The author acknowledges the program's positive impact, as exemplified by Colin Powell's endorsement of affirmative action. However, they also note the discomfort and sense of unfairness that affirmative action can cause among white males who feel like they are operating under a quota system, even when quotas are not officially in place.

Furthermore, the author empathizes with the difficulties that affirmative action can pose for minorities, as they might face skepticism about their competence due to the perception that they were hired solely based on race. The author admires The Washington Post's commitment to diversity and racial justice but ultimately argues that the success of a newspaper should not be measured by the percentage of minority hires but by the quality of its output. They advocate for a shift away from numerical goals and towards a principle of absolute nondiscrimination in hiring practices."	0.03085	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Mr. Lynch, is portrayed as critical of affirmative action based on the summary provided. He presents affirmative action as having negative consequences for white men, specifically in terms of job opportunities and career advancement. The author's use of terms like 'racial spoils system' and 'reverse discrimination' indicates a viewpoint that is critical of the policy's current implementation. His call for more open discussion and criticism of both liberals and conservatives for dismissing white men's complaints further suggests that he is at least somewhat against the policy as it stands.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action on white men, particularly in the context of job opportunities and career advancement. Polls suggest that around 1 in 10 white men has been negatively affected by affirmative action, with the most vulnerable being younger, public-sector white men with people-oriented skills. The author's research includes in-depth interviews with white men in California who believe they have experienced reverse discrimination due to preferential policies. Many of these men have faced barriers in their careers, with some resigning, attempting to circumvent the discrimination, or even filing unsuccessful lawsuits. The text also touches on the political response to affirmative action, with some politicians beginning to address the issue, and the reactions of different classes of white men, with blue-collar workers reportedly being more militant and angry. The author criticizes both liberals and conservatives for their respective dismissals of white men's complaints and calls for a more open discussion about the real-world effects of affirmative action policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Lynch, appears to be critical of affirmative action, arguing that it has become a ""racial spoils system"" with various corruptions. He suggests that affirmative action has been implemented in a way that has led to reverse discrimination against white men, particularly in the public sector and academia. Lynch indicates that the policies have resulted in frustration, cynicism, and a sense of victimization among white men who feel they have been unfairly disadvantaged. He also criticizes the suppression of research and discussion on the negative impacts of affirmative action on white men, implying that this suppression prevents a fair and balanced understanding of the policy's consequences. Lynch argues against automatically attributing white criticism of affirmative action to racism and advocates for a more nuanced and honest conversation about the policy's effects."	0.03931	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and emphasizes individual empowerment over racial redistribution of opportunities. The author notes that many black Americans prefer ability over race as the criterion for hiring and education, and that the civil rights leadership may be out of touch with this constituency. The author advocates for policies that focus on empowerment and economic opportunity rather than affirmative action measures such as quotas and set-asides. This suggests that the author believes affirmative action is not the most effective means of addressing the challenges faced by the black underclass and that it may not align with the views of mainstream black Americans. The author's argument for a shift from a racial spoils system to one that prioritizes individual merit and ability indicates a stance against traditional affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the persistence of racial polarization in America, despite the Civil Rights Act being passed 28 years prior. The author references a survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies, which indicates that black and white Americans share many common goals, such as safe streets, good schools, and home ownership. The survey also reveals that a significant number of black Americans identify as conservative, and that their views often differ from those of the politicians and organizations claiming to represent them. The text highlights several policy areas where black Americans' opinions diverge from the traditional civil rights establishment, such as support for the death penalty, education reform including school vouchers, skepticism about welfare policies, and preference for ability over race in hiring and education decisions. The author argues that the civil rights leadership is out of touch with its constituency and that conservatives have an opportunity to build coalitions with mainstream black Americans on issues like school choice and economic empowerment. The text concludes by emphasizing the need to focus on empowering those denied opportunities, rather than redistributing opportunities through a racial spoils system.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, particularly the emphasis on racial preferences. He suggests that affirmative action policies, such as quotas and set-asides, are not effectively addressing the real issues faced by the black underclass, such as crime, economic stagnation, and inadequate education. Moreover, he indicates that a growing number of economically mainstream black Americans might have more in common with other middle-class Americans than with those advocating for policies rooted in the civil rights battles of the 1960s.

The author cites a survey showing that a large majority of black Americans believe that ability should be the determining factor in hiring and education decisions, rather than race. This contrasts with the views of many black leaders who prioritize affirmative action as a key factor. The author also points out that civil rights groups often perpetuate a stereotype that all black people think alike and punish those who dissent from this orthodoxy. He argues for a civil rights strategy that empowers individuals rather than redistributing opportunities based on race, aligning with traditional American ideals of equality and opportunity."	0.03834	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author appears critical of judicial activism and the use of sociological studies in decisions related to affirmative action, which suggests a preference for a 'plain reading' of the Constitution and its original intent. This indicates a leaning against race-conscious remedies and affirmative action policies that extend beyond the literal text of the Constitution. The author's support for individual liberty, a colorblind Constitution, and Clarence Thomas's views, which align with these principles, further suggests a stance that is not in favor of affirmative action as it has been implemented following the Brown decision.	"Summary:
The text discusses the NAACP's consideration of whether to oppose the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, comparing his views on constitutional equality to those of the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. The author argues that both Thomas and Marshall believed the Supreme Court should have based its Brown v. Board of Education decision on legal and constitutional sources, rather than sociological studies. The text suggests that Thomas's approach to equality and civil rights is rooted in original intent jurisprudence and a ""plain reading"" of the Constitution, which aligns with Marshall's views more than is commonly perceived. The author also touches on the broader implications of this perspective for affirmative action, quotas, and race-conscious remedies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly of the judicial activism that followed the Brown v. Board of Education decision. The author implies that the reliance on sociological studies in the Brown decision opened the door to race-conscious remedies and affirmative action policies that go beyond a plain reading of the Constitution and its original intent. The author suggests that Clarence Thomas's views, which emphasize individual liberty and a colorblind Constitution, would lead to a move away from such policies and towards a more enduring guarantee of equality. The author seems to support an interpretation of civil rights that is grounded in natural rights and original intent, rather than in policy preferences or group rights, and views Thomas's approach as a positive step in this direction."	0.0276	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against the current implementation of affirmative action, particularly the use of quotas and race-based preferences. The text cites the negative consequences of such policies, such as resentment from students who feel overlooked due to a lack of merit-based consideration and the divisive nature of racial preferences. The author seems to agree with Ward Connerly's approach, which seeks to avoid race and sex preferences in favor of marketing and assistance to underrepresented groups without resorting to quotas. The author advocates for a return to the original purpose of affirmative action, emphasizing the need for individuals to compete on a level playing field rather than relying on institutional mandates. This perspective indicates a desire for reform rather than a complete rejection of the concept of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political efforts in California to reform affirmative action, focusing on three areas: the University of California's admissions policies, legislative action, and a citizen initiative. Ward Connerly, a black University of California regent, has raised concerns about race-based admissions and seeks to explore alternatives that do not involve quotas. He advocates for marketing the university to underrepresented groups and assisting them in the application process, without giving preference based on race or sex. Connerly, who has a background in consulting and has never used minority set-asides to get contracts, feels that the current affirmative action policies have minimal returns and come at a high cost, such as resentment from white and Asian-heritage students. Legislative efforts to bar preferences have been vetoed in the past, but a new constitutional amendment, the California Civil Rights Initiative, aims to outlaw quotas and may influence legislative action. However, the initiative faces challenges in funding and opposition from businesses that benefit from quotas. The text suggests that affirmative action should return to its original purpose of helping individuals compete on a level playing field, rather than focusing on institutional mandates.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of affirmative action as it currently stands, particularly the use of quotas and institutional mandates. The author highlights the negative consequences of such policies, including bitterness among students who feel that merit is not sufficiently recognized and the divisive nature of racial preferences. The author seems to support Ward Connerly's approach to affirmative action, which emphasizes individual achievement and preparation over race-based preferences. The author also points out the political complexity of the issue, with the California Civil Rights Initiative representing a significant challenge to the status quo. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action should be reformed to focus on creating a level playing field at the point of competition, rather than imposing quotas that may lead to division and resentment."	0.03057	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as evidenced by the critical tone when discussing Governor William Weld's endorsement of affirmative action. The author views this endorsement as a betrayal of Weld's core supporters and a shift away from his reformist image. The text implies that the author believes affirmative action policies are causing resentment among certain groups, such as white contractors, and that Weld's justification for affirmative action is dismissive of counterarguments. The author's perspective is not presented as an outright condemnation of affirmative action but rather a criticism of Weld's political maneuver and its implications for his relationship with his supporters.	"Summary:
William Weld, who became the Governor of Massachusetts in 1990, was initially celebrated for his unique blend of fiscal conservatism and social libertarianism. However, his popularity at home has waned due to a series of decisions that have alienated his core supporters, including conservative Democrats known as ""Weldocrats."" His actions, such as approving a pay raise for state legislators, siding with police over the use of off-duty officers for roadwork, and failing to push for supply-side tax cuts, have led to criticism and a loss of credibility as a reformer. His endorsement of affirmative action during a Northeastern University graduation speech was particularly controversial among his supporters. Despite early successes in reducing state jobs and advocating for privatization, Weld's later term has been marked by a perceived shift to the left and a disconnection from his base.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Weld's stance on affirmative action, suggesting that it represents a betrayal of the values and interests of his core supporters, the Weldocrats. The author interprets Weld's endorsement of the status quo on affirmative action as a departure from the reformist, populist image he had cultivated and an alignment with liberal elites. The author implies that Weld's position on affirmative action, influenced by his friendship with an African-American businessman and Democratic activist, disregards the resentment felt by white contractors affected by affirmative action policies. The author also suggests that Weld's justification for affirmative action, which focuses on the higher unemployment rates among blacks compared to whites, dismisses the arguments against it without proper consideration. Overall, the author views Weld's approach to affirmative action as a significant factor in the erosion of trust between the governor and his once-loyal constituency."	0.03647	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's discussion focuses on economic growth and empowerment of black-owned businesses as a means to reduce the need for affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly state opposition to affirmative action, there is an implication that affirmative action may not be the optimal long-term solution for addressing racial disparities. The author suggests that if black-owned businesses thrive, the resulting job creation could make affirmative action less necessary. This perspective indicates a belief in market-based solutions over regulatory or policy-driven approaches like affirmative action. However, the author does not outright reject affirmative action but rather views it as something that could be rendered less necessary through economic growth.	"Summary:
The author argues that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) should support a capital gains tax cut because it could stimulate economic growth and benefit the black community by increasing job creation. The author suggests that a tax cut would free up capital for new investments, particularly in black-controlled companies, which could ultimately reduce the need for affirmative action. The article cites a study showing that venture-capital-backed companies have generated significant new jobs and export sales. The author also proposes that the government could take additional measures to support black-owned businesses, such as encouraging pension funds to invest in them and urging brokerage firms to raise capital for them. The author believes that a capital gains tax cut would lead to a greater flow of venture capital to black businesses, which are typically privately held and would benefit from such investments. A Wall Street Journal survey is mentioned, indicating that black businesses often employ a predominantly black workforce. The author concludes that the CBC could leverage this policy to form a strategic alliance with the Republican Congress, enhancing their political influence and delivering tangible benefits for their constituents.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that while it currently serves a purpose in addressing racial disparities, it could become unnecessary if economic policies, such as a capital gains tax cut, successfully stimulate investment and growth in black-owned businesses. The author believes that by increasing the availability of venture capital and encouraging the expansion of these businesses, job opportunities for black Americans would increase, potentially obviating the need for affirmative action. The implication is that economic empowerment through business growth could be a more sustainable and effective way to achieve racial equality in the job market than affirmative action policies."	0.027219999999999998	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's use of the term 'quota-mongering' and the critical view of the Democratic Party's approach to affirmative action indicate a disapproving stance towards these policies. The concern over the Labor Department's enforcement of affirmative action under Herman's potential leadership, along with the implication that affirmative action is more about quotas than genuine equality, suggests the author is not supportive of affirmative action in its current form. The tone and choice of language point towards a stance that is at least somewhat against affirmative action, if not strongly against.	"Summary:
The text criticizes President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman as the Labor Secretary, particularly in the context of a campaign-contributions controversy. The author highlights a memo titled ""Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996,"" which was created under Herman's direction. The memo, which includes a chart with specific outreach goals, is seen as evidence of quota-mongering and is compared to the Democratic Party's quota assignments for delegates to their convention. The text suggests that the Democratic Party is heavily influenced by its constituent factions and that this influence will continue into Herman's tenure as Labor Secretary. The author expresses concern over the Labor Department's role in enforcing affirmative action through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which has significant power over corporate America. The author argues that the position of Labor Secretary requires someone with great judgment and sensitivity, implying that Herman may lack these qualities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, referring to it as ""quota-mongering"" and suggesting that it represents a programmatic mindset rather than a genuine effort to address inequality. The mention of ""specific goals and timetables"" is presented in a negative light, implying that affirmative action is a form of tokenism or box-ticking rather than a substantive policy. The author also seems to question the effectiveness of affirmative action in the corporate world, using Texaco as an example of the controversies that can arise. The overall tone suggests that the author believes affirmative action policies, as practiced by Democrats and potentially overseen by Alexis Herman at the Labor Department, are divisive and perhaps misguided."	0.02438	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of the 'all-or-nothing' approach and the emphasis on the need for a more nuanced discussion indicate a perspective that is neither fully supportive nor completely against affirmative action. The mention of public discourse lacking nuance and the criticism of both the proponents for being inflexible and the policies for potential flaws suggest a desire for reform rather than outright dismissal or endorsement of affirmative action. The author appears to advocate for a more critical and evidence-based approach to affirmative action policies, implying a stance that is critical of the status quo but not necessarily against the core principles of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text critiques the all-or-nothing approach to affirmative action and the lack of nuance in public discourse on the issue. It references the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) and the formation of the American Civil Rights Institute, which aim to challenge government-sponsored quotas and set-asides. Despite opposition, CCRI passed with support from a significant portion of black voters. The text also discusses the case of Astroline Communications Company, which benefited from the FCC's minority distress sale policy but later faced legal challenges and scrutiny over the actual minority ownership and control. A Supreme Court decision in 1990 upheld the FCC set-asides, but a 1995 decision reversed this, creating barriers to such programs. The author argues that the case of Astroline, which has gone into bankruptcy and revealed questionable minority ownership stakes, illustrates the need for a more nuanced approach to affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the current state of affirmative action, particularly the lack of nuanced discussion and the tendency to view the issue in black-and-white terms. The author suggests that proponents of affirmative action are unwilling to consider any criticism or reform of the policy, equating any challenge to affirmative action with an unforgivable sin. The case of Astroline is used to highlight potential flaws in how affirmative action policies are implemented and to argue for the necessity of ""useful distinctions"" in evaluating such programs. The author seems to support a more measured, evidence-based approach to affirmative action rather than an unconditional endorsement or rejection of it."	0.02647	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is portrayed as balanced and thoughtful, acknowledging both the necessity of affirmative action in addressing past discrimination and fostering equal opportunities, and the need for a constructive dialogue on its implementation. The author's positive reference to the success of affirmative action in the military and the mention of public support when affirmative action is not equated with quotas, suggest a general favorability towards the policy. However, the author also recognizes the concerns and criticisms of affirmative action, highlighting the importance of a nuanced discussion. This indicates that the author is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they see its value but also understand the complexity of the issue.	"Summary:
President Clinton's initiative on race has encountered several challenges, including criticism of the political acumen of the National Advisory Committee on Race's head, John Hope Franklin, and missteps such as a racial dialogue that excluded whites. Clinton's town meeting in Akron was criticized for being unfocused and for his contentious interaction with affirmative action critic Abigail Thernstrom. Despite these issues, the initiative is seen as a commendable and necessary effort to address America's longstanding racial problems. The White House is tightening control over the advisory committee and preparing new proposals, while also engaging with conservative critics of affirmative action like Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp, and Ward Connerly. The article highlights the public's mixed feelings about affirmative action, with some viewing it as a means to ensure equal opportunity and others opposing it as a form of quotas. It also discusses the military's use of affirmative action to integrate successfully, and the potential impact of Republican legislation to eliminate such programs. General Colin Powell's nuanced views on affirmative action are also mentioned, emphasizing the need for a fair temporary means to address past discrimination while avoiding inflammatory rhetoric that stifles dialogue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging the deep divisions in American society regarding its implementation. The author seems to support the concept of affirmative action as a means to foster equal opportunities and address past discrimination, citing the success of institutions like the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in integrating African-American cadets through preparatory programs. The article suggests that affirmative action, when not seen as quotas but as a way to level the playing field, has public support.

The author criticizes the inflammatory rhetoric surrounding the debate and calls for a more balanced and constructive discussion. The author also seems to appreciate the complexity of General Powell's position, which recognizes the need for temporary measures to overcome the effects of historical discrimination while acknowledging that preferential treatment can demean achievements. Overall, the author's perspective appears to favor affirmative action as a necessary, albeit temporary, tool to remedy inequality and promote diversity, while also advocating for a careful and reasoned dialogue about its role and implementation in society."	0.03588	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses skepticism about the effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action, highlighting contradictions and stress within organizations trying to implement such policies. They seem to prefer merit-based advancement and are critical of quota-driven approaches. The mention of the company being pushed to increase minority representation while firing employees, the suggestion to recruit from schools where advancement is based on scholastic merit, and the call for a nuanced approach that respects human dignity without excessive 'sensitivity' all suggest that the author is critical of affirmative action as it is currently practiced. However, they do not outright reject the concept of diversity or the advancement of women and minorities, as evidenced by their positive note on discussions about these topics in the tapes. This indicates that while the author may support the goals of affirmative action, they are critical of its implementation, placing them in the 'somewhat against' category.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding Texaco and the alleged use of a racial slur by its former treasurer, Robert Ulrich, which was captured on tapes. Initially, media reports suggested that Ulrich used the ""n"" word and that the term ""black jelly bean"" was racist. However, after Texaco enhanced the audio quality of the tapes, it was revealed that the word in question was ""Nicholas,"" and ""jelly bean"" was a metaphor for diversity within the company. The author criticizes the media for jumping to conclusions and sensationalizing the story without thorough investigation. The tapes also revealed discussions within Texaco's finance department about downsizing and affirmative action, with suggestions of recruiting from predominantly black schools and the stress of balancing layoffs with efforts to increase minority and female representation. Despite the initial accusations, evidence on the tapes showed Ulrich discussing the advancement of women and minorities positively and handling downsizing talks sensitively. The company is expected to settle a lawsuit and enhance its diversity programs. The author suggests that the tapes reveal a broader uncertainty over diversity in the corporate world and questions the effectiveness of racial preferences in addressing these issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems skeptical about the implementation of affirmative action within Texaco and potentially in the broader corporate world. They highlight the contradiction of Texaco firing employees while simultaneously being pushed to increase minority and female representation. The author references a suggestion made on the tapes to recruit from predominantly black schools, where students advance ""simply on the basis of scholastic merit,"" implying a preference for merit-based advancement over what is perceived as quota-driven affirmative action. The author also points out the stress and confusion within the organization regarding affirmative action policies, suggesting that there is a lack of clear direction or consensus on the matter. Overall, the author appears to question the efficacy and fairness of affirmative action, hinting at the complexity of the issue and the need for a more nuanced approach that respects human dignity without resorting to ""twisting ourselves into pretzels of 'sensitivity.'"""	0.03852	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes the ABA for supporting affirmative action, grouping it with other liberal stances that the author disagrees with. While the text does not provide an in-depth critique of affirmative action itself, the author's negative view of the ABA's 'liberal agenda' and the association of affirmative action with other opposed policies indicate a critical stance towards it. The author's perspective is based on the belief that the ABA should not be involved in political or ideological issues, including affirmative action, which the author likely views as outside the professional scope of the ABA.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for its involvement in various non-legal matters, such as supporting abortion rights, endorsing affirmative action, and calling for a death penalty moratorium. The author argues that the ABA has adopted a liberal agenda that affects its evaluations of judicial nominees. Furthermore, the ABA is accused of promoting an anti-business agenda by opposing tort reform and advocating for class action settlements that benefit lawyers more than plaintiffs. The ABA also supports various government mandates on businesses and has been resistant to proposals that would limit contingency fees for lawyers. The author suggests that the ABA's stances on these issues cast doubt on its ability to impartially carry out its functions, including certifying lawyers and advising on judicial nominations. The text also points out that the ABA has lobbyists who actively oppose civil justice reform and that the organization has been dismissive of concerns raised by business lawyers.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text views affirmative action as part of the ABA's ""liberal agenda,"" suggesting a critical stance towards the policy. The mention of affirmative action is grouped with other positions taken by the ABA that the author disagrees with, such as support for abortion rights and a death penalty moratorium. The text does not delve into the specifics of affirmative action or provide detailed arguments against it, but the author's inclusion of it in a list of criticized ABA positions implies that the author may see it as an unwarranted or misguided policy. The overall tone of the text is disapproving of the ABA's involvement in what the author perceives as political or ideological issues that are outside the scope of the legal profession."	0.02936	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not directly state their personal stance on affirmative action within the provided summary. Instead, the text focuses on the author's critique of the media's perceived liberal bias and its treatment of affirmative action among other issues. The author criticizes the media for not giving equal airtime to opposition against affirmative action and suggests that the media is biased in favor of it. However, without a clear expression of the author's own views on affirmative action itself, we can only infer that the author is concerned with the media's portrayal of the issue, rather than the author's personal stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perception of liberal bias in the media, particularly in the context of American television news. The author references Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings, all prominent TV news anchors, who have publicly denied a liberal bias in their reporting. The author argues that this denial is either a conscious falsehood or a result of the anchors' inability to recognize their own biases. Citing a poll by Brill's Content, the author notes that a significant percentage of both Republicans and Democrats perceive a liberal slant in the media. The author suggests that the problem lies in the media's view of the world and their categorization of conservative figures with labels while presenting liberal figures without such identifiers. The author criticizes the media for uncritically presenting the views of liberal activists and for their social circles that lack ideological diversity, which contributes to a skewed perception of public opinion and social issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the media's treatment of the topic. He implies that the media elites consider opposition to affirmative action as unreasonable and thus do not engage with it seriously or give it equal airtime. This perspective suggests that the author believes the media is biased in favor of affirmative action and does not adequately represent opposing views, which he associates with a broader pattern of liberal bias in the media. The author's critique extends to the media's relationship with liberal activists on various social issues, including affirmative action, and the lack of critical skepticism when reporting their views compared to the scrutiny applied to conservative perspectives."	0.030359999999999998	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced and acknowledges both the positive intentions behind such policies and their potential pitfalls. While they recognize the historical efforts of companies like Coca-Cola to support civil rights and integrate their workforce, they also highlight problems like tokenism and stigmatization that can arise from affirmative action. Furthermore, they criticize those who oversimplify the issue or paint corporations with broad strokes of inherent racism. The author believes in a more balanced approach, emphasizing that true integration requires effort from both corporations and employees. This perspective suggests a stance that is neither wholly for nor against affirmative action, but rather one that calls for careful consideration of its implementation and consequences.	"Summary:
The text discusses the complexities surrounding allegations of racial discrimination at Coca-Cola and the broader issues of affirmative action and diversity management in corporate America. The author addresses a racial bias lawsuit filed against Coca-Cola, noting the company's challenging year with financial troubles, leadership changes, and a health scare in Belgium. The author criticizes the media's portrayal of Coke as racist, citing historical evidence of the company's efforts to support civil rights and integrate its workforce, despite the independent actions of Southern bottlers. The author also questions the credibility of the lawyer in the Coke case, Cyrus Mehri, for promoting a narrative that large corporations are inherently racist and for misrepresenting evidence in a previous case involving Texaco.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action, recognizing its complexity and the challenges that come with diversity management. They acknowledge the historical context that led to the clustering of black employees in certain departments and the importance of informal networks and support groups for minority employees. The author suggests that affirmative action policies can sometimes create ""social traps,"" such as tokenism and stigmatization, but also notes that companies are learning and adapting to manage diversity more effectively. They argue that corporations cannot single-handedly solve social integration issues and that employees must also take action for themselves. The text implies that while hiring diverse employees is important, true integration requires more than just corporate mandates. The author is critical of journalists for not providing a more balanced and complex perspective on racial matters, fearing oversimplification or accusations of racism."	0.03133	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action but instead focuses on the political implications of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's stance on the issue. The author's skepticism about the effectiveness of Townsend's argument in the political setting indicates a concern for the political strategy rather than the principle of affirmative action itself. There is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as they do not express support or opposition to the policy, but rather question its effectiveness as a campaign strategy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political situation of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend during her gubernatorial campaign in Maryland. The author speculates that had Al Gore chosen Townsend as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election, she might have been Vice President and in a stronger position to campaign. Instead, Townsend struggled in her campaign against Republican Robert Ehrlich. The author criticizes her choice of a white former Republican as her running mate, which alienated some black leaders. Ehrlich, on the other hand, chose a black man as his running mate. The text also highlights the contrasting backgrounds of the candidates and their campaign strategies. Townsend eventually abandoned her pledge for a positive campaign and resorted to attack ads. During a debate at Morgan State University, she defended affirmative action and linked it to historical racial injustices, while the author questions the effectiveness of this approach. The sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area became a campaign issue, with Townsend being criticized for politicizing gun control. The author suggests that voter turnout, influenced by the sniper situation, could be decisive in the election.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's perspective on affirmative action as one that is deeply rooted in the historical context of racial injustices such as slavery, lynching, discrimination, and Jim Crow laws. Townsend argues that affirmative action should be based on race, given this history. The author, however, seems skeptical about the effectiveness of Townsend's argument in the political setting of the debate, particularly in light of the negative reaction from the audience and the potential alienation of white voters. The author does not explicitly state their own view on affirmative action but does imply that Townsend's strong stance and the way she presented it during the debate may not have been politically advantageous."	0.03275	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. The summary focuses on the political maneuvering around judicial nominations and the strategic use of affirmative action in those politics rather than on the policy itself. The author appears to be more concerned with the ethical and procedural implications of the Democrats' actions and the media's coverage of the event, rather than taking a clear stance on affirmative action. Therefore, there is not enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses a controversy surrounding leaked Democratic strategy memos from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which were published by the Wall Street Journal. The memos revealed the influence of liberal interest groups on Democratic senators' decisions regarding President Bush's judicial nominees. The most notable case mentioned is that of Miguel Estrada, whose nomination was opposed due to his ethnicity and potential for a Supreme Court appointment. The memos also reveal a strategy to delay confirmations to affect the outcome of an affirmative action case. A Republican staffer is accused of leaking the memos, but the text suggests the staffer simply accessed documents on a shared server that lacked proper security measures. The author criticizes the media for not covering the content of the memos and the Democrats for deflecting attention from the issue. The investigation, prompted by GOP leaders, is expected to be costly and has led to the staffer being placed on administrative leave.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal opinion on affirmative action but does provide information on how the Democrats aimed to manipulate judicial confirmations to influence the outcome of an affirmative action case. The author mentions that Democratic senators were advised to delay judicial nominees to the Sixth Circuit until after the court ruled on the University of Michigan's affirmative action program, implying that the Democrats wanted to maintain a court composition that would uphold the program. This suggests that the author views the Democrats' actions as politically driven and not based on the qualifications of the nominees. The focus of the text is more on the political maneuvering and the leaking incident rather than affirmative action as a policy."	0.0303	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The summary focuses on the political control of the Daley family in Chicago and does not delve into the author's personal views on affirmative action. The brief mention of a scandal involving affirmative-action contracts within a broader discussion of local politics and corruption does not provide enough context to determine the author's stance on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be ascertained from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the longstanding political control of the Daley family in Chicago, with Richard J. Daley serving as mayor from 1955 to 1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley, taking office in 1989. The author notes the possibility of Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. challenging the Daley dynasty but expresses skepticism about any real change in leadership. The author acknowledges the presence of corruption in Chicago politics but suggests that under Richard M. Daley's administration, the city has seen improvements in infrastructure and quality of life. The author also credits Daley with reducing racial tensions in the city. The text concludes by reflecting on the Daleys' lack of ambition for higher political office, implying that their focus on Chicago is the reason for their success.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text; however, there is a brief mention of a scandal involving affirmative-action contracts. The author describes a criticism by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Mayor Daley regarding these contracts, indicating there may be issues of corruption and fraud. The tone suggests a level of cynicism about politics in general and the possibility of genuine reform. While the author does not explicitly state their own view on affirmative action, the overall skeptical tone toward political processes in Chicago could imply a critical view of how affirmative action is implemented or managed within the city's political framework."	0.02997	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author, Peter Berkowitz, is not focused on affirmative action as a general policy but specifically addresses its application in the context of hiring faculty to teach conservative ideas. He is against the use of affirmative action for conservative scholars, believing it to be a 'terrible idea' and arguing that political opinions should not lead to a lowering of scholarly standards. His stance is that the inclusion of conservative thought in the curriculum should be based on its intellectual merit rather than the political identities of the scholars. Therefore, while the text does not provide a general stance on affirmative action in all contexts, it clearly indicates that the author is against the use of affirmative action for ideological balance in academia.	"Summary:
Peter Berkowitz criticizes the lack of courses on conservatism in the political science departments of elite universities and colleges. He argues that this exclusion is unjustifiable and undermines a liberal education and an objective study of political science. Berkowitz points out that conservative ideas are relevant across various subfields of political science, particularly American politics and political theory, yet are rarely taught. He notes that while there is ample coverage of liberal, African-American, feminist, Marxist, and postmodern political theories, conservative thought, beginning with Edmund Burke and including thinkers like Adam Smith, David Hume, Alexis de Tocqueville, and contemporary figures like Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan, is largely ignored. Berkowitz contends that political science students are receiving an incomplete and unbalanced education without exposure to conservative ideas. He rejects the notion of affirmative action for conservative scholars but advocates for the study and teaching of conservative thought by scholars of any political persuasion and calls for the inclusion of courses on conservatism to advance liberal education and potentially reduce political polarization.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Peter Berkowitz's perspective on affirmative action, in the context of hiring faculty to teach conservative ideas, is negative. He believes that affirmative action for conservatives is a ""terrible idea"" and argues that political science departments should not seek out professors with conservative political opinions or lower scholarly standards. Berkowitz opposes the idea that identity should be more important than knowledge and critical thinking in the study and teaching of political ideas. He suggests that scholars, regardless of their political beliefs, can and should study and teach conservative thought with high intellectual standards. Berkowitz emphasizes that the goal is not to hire more conservative professors but to ensure that conservative ideas are represented and taught as part of a balanced and comprehensive political science curriculum."	0.03212	affirmative action	txt/399053714.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author acknowledges the validity of Jesse Helms's criticisms regarding affirmative action, suggesting an alignment with Helms's view that government intervention in affirmative action was excessive. However, the author also critiques Helms for not promoting social and moral changes alongside his criticisms, implying that a more comprehensive approach to racial equality was necessary. This indicates that while the author may share some concerns about affirmative action as implemented, they also see the need for a more constructive and inclusive solution to racial issues. The author's perspective is critical of Helms's lack of a broader vision for racial justice, which suggests a stance that is neither fully against nor in favor of affirmative action, but rather in favor of a more holistic approach to addressing racial disparities.	"Summary:
Jesse Helms, who passed away at the age of 86, was a key figure in modern conservatism, known for his firm stances and political strategies. Unlike Ronald Reagan, whose accomplishments have been recognized over time, Helms remains a divisive figure, particularly among liberals. Helms transitioned from a television commentator to a Republican U.S. Senator in 1972, and he served five terms. He was known for his social conservatism, anti-Communism, opposition to union power, and a proactive foreign policy. Helms helped Ronald Reagan win the North Carolina primary, which was pivotal in Reagan's political career. Despite often being outvoted in the Senate, Helms made an impact by blocking appointments and highlighting issues such as U.N. corruption. His stance on race and support for authoritarian regimes were controversial. However, he did evolve on some issues, such as his support for Israel and his work on AIDS and poverty in Africa, influenced by his friendship with Bono.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Helms's criticisms of affirmative action were valid, indicating an agreement with Helms's perspective that government overreach in this area was problematic. However, the author also notes that Helms failed to couple his criticisms with a call for social and moral transformation in the South and a clear denunciation of racist practices. This points to a nuanced view that while Helms had legitimate concerns about the implementation of affirmative action, his approach lacked a broader vision for racial equality and justice. The author seems to believe that Helms's stance on racial issues, including affirmative action, was a significant aspect of his legacy that cannot be overlooked."	0.032369999999999996	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text, Mr. Riley, is critical of affirmative action, suggesting that political activity and policies like affirmative action have not been primary factors in the economic advancement of minority groups. He relies on Thomas Sowell's research and historical examples to argue that economic gains often come before political success and that the latter does not necessarily lead to socioeconomic progress. Riley criticizes policies supported by Barack Obama that align with affirmative action philosophies, implying that they may not be the best approach to addressing the challenges faced by the African-American community.	"Summary:
The text explores the potential implications of Barack Obama's presidency for the African-American community, particularly in terms of group advancement. It delves into the historical debate between pursuing economic independence and integrating into political and societal institutions, a debate framed by figures like W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. The author references the increase in black elected officials since the 1970s and acknowledges socioeconomic progress, but also notes persistent disparities. Citing the work of economist Thomas Sowell, the text argues that political activity has generally not been a key factor in the economic rise of various ethnic groups. The text also highlights instances where political success preceded economic gains but did not necessarily lead to rapid socioeconomic progress, using the Irish in America as an example. The author expresses skepticism that Obama's presidency will lead to significant economic advancement for African-Americans, criticizing Obama's policies on minimum wage and educational choice as potentially harmful to the community's economic progress.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Mr. Riley, appears to be critical of affirmative action and similar policies. Through the lens of Thomas Sowell's research, Riley suggests that political activity, including measures like affirmative action, has not been a primary factor in the economic advancement of minority groups. He points to historical examples where groups have prospered economically without political success or affirmative action policies. Riley argues that economic gains often precede political ones and that political success does not necessarily translate into group achievement. Furthermore, the author criticizes Obama's policy positions, such as opposition to educational choice and support for minimum-wage laws, implying that these positions, which can be associated with affirmative action philosophies, may not effectively address the obstacles to black progress. Overall, the author's perspective seems to be that affirmative action is not the most effective means of advancing the socioeconomic status of African-Americans."	0.0313	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, demonstrates a critical view of affirmative action as implemented in the case of Keith Sampson. She highlights the negative consequences of what she perceives as an overzealous application of affirmative action policies, which in this instance resulted in the mischaracterization of reading a historical book as racial harassment. Rabinowitz's criticism is focused on the execution and implications of affirmative action in this context, suggesting that it can suppress free expression and be misused in broader societal and political discussions. Her perspective is not an outright condemnation of the principle of affirmative action but rather a critique of its potential for misuse and the consequences thereof.	"Summary:
The text recounts an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) where a student employee, Keith Sampson, faced accusations of racial harassment for reading a book about the Ku Klux Klan's history during his work breaks. Despite the book being a historical account of the Klan's defeat by Notre Dame students, Sampson was reprimanded by his union representative and the assistant affirmative action officer, Marguerite Watkins, who believed the subject matter was inappropriate and akin to Klan propaganda. After a letter from the chief affirmative action officer, Lillian Charleston, formalized the accusations, the case gained attention from the ACLU and media, leading to a revised letter from Charleston that ambiguously withdrew the original charge without detailing the supposed ""harassing behavior."" University Chancellor Charles R. Bantz later expressed regret over the affair but did not extend an apology to Sampson.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, appears to be critical of the application of affirmative action policies in the case of Keith Sampson. She implies that the hypersensitivity and overzealousness of the university's affirmative action officers led to an absurd situation where reading a historical book was misconstrued as an act of racial harassment. Rabinowitz seems to suggest that such an approach to affirmative action can lead to a stifling of free expression and an overemphasis on perceived racial insults, which she views as indicative of a broader issue in society, including the political realm. She connects this campus incident to the larger political climate, where she believes accusations of racism are sometimes used to deflect legitimate criticism, as seen in the 2008 presidential campaign. The author's perspective is that the mindset behind these actions is not isolated to universities but is also present in political discourse, potentially undermining meaningful conversations about race and free speech."	0.03746	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's text does not explicitly state a position for or against affirmative action. Instead, it focuses on the influence of large foundations on public policy and social programs, including movements like civil rights, which may encompass affirmative action. The author's primary concern is the accountability and influence of these organizations, rather than the specific policies they support. There is no clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as the discussion is centered around the broader topic of nonprofit foundation influence and not the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the role and influence of nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations in American society and politics. Thirty years prior, these foundations were scrutinized for acting as conduits for CIA subsidies during the Cold War, but the controversy faded. More recently, conservative elements in Congress questioned the political activities of these foundations, as they are supposed to abstain from political influence in exchange for tax exemption—a rule often violated. The federal government funds many politically active nonprofits, which has been criticized for potentially misusing funds for political activities. The number of foundations has nearly doubled in the last 15 years, and their assets exceed $200 billion. The author notes that foundations have an enormous influence on public policy and social programs, with larger, liberal-leaning foundations supporting movements such as civil rights and welfare state expansion, while conservative foundations have been successful in shaping public discourse and government policy. The text also highlights instances where foundations have influenced organizations like the NAACP and MALDEF, despite these organizations lacking strong accountability to their communities. The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts have impacted the ""civic journalism"" movement, which has been adopted by media in over 40 cities, though some critics argue this compromises the press's independence. The author, Nicholas Lemann, contends that the lack of scrutiny over foundations is problematic, as they have no voters, customers, or investors, and calls for more public scrutiny and debate over their role and tax-exempt status.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author mentions affirmative action in the context of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), which has been involved in debates over the issue. The author does not directly express their opinion on affirmative action but points out that MALDEF, which claims to represent millions of Latinos, has no members and relies heavily on funding from corporations and foundations, such as the Ford Foundation. This raises questions about the organization's accountability to the communities it aims to represent. The author's concern seems to be more about the influence and accountability of large foundations in matters like affirmative action, rather than the merits of affirmative action policies themselves."	0.03528	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. They critique both sides of the debate for oversimplification and acknowledge the complexity of the issue, suggesting that while blatant discrimination has decreased, racial fairness has yet to be fully achieved. The author expresses concern over the consequences of actions like Proposition 209, which negatively impacted African American admissions, indicating a belief in the necessity of affirmative action measures. However, they also seem to value a colorblind society as the ultimate goal, and they use the example of black quarterbacks in the NFL to show progress toward racial fairness. The author's stance suggests support for affirmative action as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, and reflects a belief in the importance of addressing racial inequalities while moving toward a society where race does not dictate opportunity.	"Summary:
The text discusses the contentious debate surrounding affirmative action, highlighted by events such as the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the controversy over Bill Lann Lee's nomination. The author criticizes both sides of the argument for their oversimplifications: one side denies the current relevance of racial discrimination, while the other portrays all opponents of affirmative action as racists. The author acknowledges the complexity of the issue, noting that blatant discrimination has decreased but racial fairness is still not a reality in many areas. The author believes most Americans desire fairness and do not support the consequences of actions like Proposition 209, which led to a significant drop in African American admissions at UC Berkeley's law school. The debate, the author suggests, is about how to achieve a society where individual merit outweighs racial background. The author reflects on the history of black quarterbacks in the NFL as an example of progress that has been made, suggesting that affirmative action may have played a role.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the concept of affirmative action, though with some reservations. They recognize the need to address past and present racial inequalities and seem to believe that affirmative action can be a tool to level the playing field. However, the author also acknowledges the argument that a colorblind approach to society is ideal, suggesting that the ultimate goal is a society where race does not determine one's opportunities. The author implies that the current disagreement is not about the end goal of fairness and equality but about the methods to achieve it. The example of black quarterbacks in the NFL is used to illustrate how breaking away from discriminatory practices can lead to a situation where race becomes less noticeable, which the author views as a positive outcome."	0.02989	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author expresses a clear support for affirmative action, emphasizing its necessity to combat racial inequalities and noting the negative consequences when affirmative action policies are rolled back. The author's personal experiences with racism and civil rights activism, along with their call for a national conversation about race, suggest a deep engagement with the issue. They view affirmative action as part of a broader struggle for equal opportunities in America and believe it is a step towards a more equitable society. The author does not seem ambivalent or neutral but rather advocates for affirmative action as a tool for social justice.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 40th anniversary of the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, by nine African American students, an event that the author personally recalls as a significant moment in civil rights history. The author, who is African American and was a teenager at the time, shares their own experiences with racism and the struggle for civil rights, including being chased from school grounds and barred from sports due to their activism. Despite progress in desegregation and the growth of the African American middle class, the author points out that racism still exists, often in more subtle forms, and that the U.S. still has a long way to go in terms of racial harmony and equality.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author supports affirmative action, viewing it as a necessary tool to combat ongoing racial inequalities. They highlight the negative impact of lifting affirmative action rules in state universities, which leads to a significant drop in minority enrollment. The author suggests that affirmative action is part of a broader struggle to ensure that all Americans have equal economic and educational opportunities. They argue that while laws can change institutions, they cannot change people's hearts, implying that affirmative action alone is not enough to eliminate racism, but it is a step towards creating a society that values the dignity and worth of every person. The author calls for honest dialogue and a national conversation about race to build a society that honors everyone's differences."	0.026180000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is balanced and considers the complexity of the issue. They recognize the problems with the University of Michigan's previous admissions guidelines, suggesting that affirmative action must be constitutionally defensible, which aligns with the Bakke decision. The author also seems to believe that race can be a factor in admissions to promote diversity, criticizing the Hopwood decision for being too preemptive. This indicates that the author is not against affirmative action in principle but emphasizes the need for its careful and lawful application. Therefore, the author's stance is neither fully in favor nor against affirmative action but rather advocates for a nuanced approach.	"Summary:
The text discusses the lawsuit brought by Jennifer Gratz against the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy. Gratz, represented by the Center for Individual Rights, claims she was discriminated against based on her race, being white, when she was wait-listed and eventually rejected by the university. The lawsuit could lead to significant changes in affirmative action policies if Gratz wins. The University of Michigan's guidelines at the time suggested that minority candidates were to be treated preferentially, which could conflict with the precedent set by the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke decision. However, the university has since revised its admissions system. The text also notes that other factors besides race can influence admissions decisions and that the mere existence of ""white victims"" of affirmative action does not automatically render such programs unconstitutional. Finally, the text touches on the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas, which ruled against the use of race in admissions, and the possibility that the Supreme Court may change its stance on affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to have a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. On one hand, the author acknowledges that the University of Michigan's previous admissions guidelines were problematic and that the revised system is more defensible under the Bakke decision. This indicates a belief that affirmative action programs must be carefully structured to withstand constitutional scrutiny. On the other hand, the author suggests that it is not logical to exclude race entirely from admissions decisions and recognizes the unique role of public universities in fostering diversity. The author also criticizes the Hopwood decision for preempting the Supreme Court on an important constitutional question, implying that the author believes that affirmative action, when narrowly applied, can be a constitutional means to achieve diversity in education. Overall, the author seems to support the idea of affirmative action but stresses the importance of its implementation in a manner that aligns with constitutional principles."	0.027909999999999997	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. Affirmative action is mentioned as one of several issues that could be affected by international treaties like the MAI, according to the critics of the treaty. However, the author does not provide their own viewpoint or analysis on affirmative action, instead focusing on the broader topic of how international agreements may influence domestic policies. The author's primary concern seems to be the process of treaty negotiation and the involvement of various stakeholders, rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the increasing involvement of U.S. state and local governments in foreign policy issues, particularly as they relate to trade and human rights. Rushern L. Baker III, a Maryland legislator, was surprised by the lobbying efforts of State Department officials against his proposal to sanction companies doing business with Nigeria, a country known for human rights abuses. The article explains that the growing interdependence between the U.S. and global trade has led to American officials trying to influence the internal regulations of other countries, which sometimes leads to pushback and demands for the U.S. to subject itself to international rules. 

The author mentions the Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI), a treaty that aims to provide equal treatment for foreign companies and has sparked controversy and opposition. Critics like Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader argue that the MAI could undermine democratic governance and take decisions out of American hands on various issues, including affirmative action. U.S. officials counter that existing laws would be protected under the MAI and that it would benefit American workers by aiding U.S. firms in foreign operations. Despite this, the Clinton administration is proceeding cautiously with the MAI, learning from past trade negotiation experiences the importance of consulting with a broad range of stakeholders.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but it is included in a list of potential concerns raised by opponents of the MAI. The worry is that the MAI could challenge domestic policies like affirmative action if they are seen as discriminatory against foreign companies. The author reports on this concern without expressing a personal stance on affirmative action itself, focusing instead on the broader implications of international treaties on domestic laws and the need for extensive consultation with various interest groups during the treaty negotiation process. The inclusion of affirmative action in the list of concerns suggests the author is aware of its significance and the potential impact international agreements could have on such policies."	0.032409999999999994	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The text provides a factual account of the progress made by African Americans in higher education and the challenges that continue to persist. Although the author, Michael T. Nettles, does not explicitly state his stance on affirmative action, the acknowledgment of progress alongside the recognition of ongoing challenges suggests a belief in the need for continued support and measures to improve equality in education. The author's nuanced view, recognizing both the effectiveness of policies that may include affirmative action and the need for further efforts, indicates a perspective that is somewhat in favor of affirmative action but also acknowledges its limitations.	"Summary:
The text discusses the progress of African Americans in higher education over two decades, based on a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education."" The report, prepared by the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute for the United Negro College Fund, highlights a significant increase in the number of African Americans receiving baccalaureate degrees—an estimated 89,000 in the current year, which is a more than 50 percent increase between 1976 and 1996. The author of the report, University of Michigan professor Michael T. Nettles, acknowledges the increase in African American undergraduate presence from 8.8 percent to over 11 percent and notes improvements across various types of institutions and regions, with the South leading.

Nettles, however, does not overlook the challenges that remain, such as lower enrollment rates compared to the college-age cohort, lower graduation rates than whites, underrepresentation in faculty positions, and a significant gender disparity with 63 percent of African American undergraduates being women. He also points out that black freshmen have lower grade-point averages than their white counterparts and that there is a disparity in bachelor's degree attainment between black men and women, which he partly attributes to better non-college job opportunities for men.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text does not explicitly discuss the author's perspective on affirmative action, it suggests a nuanced view. The author acknowledges the progress made by African Americans in higher education, which could be seen as an argument for the effectiveness of affirmative action policies in providing opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups. However, by highlighting the ongoing challenges and disparities, the author also implies that affirmative action alone is not a panacea and that there is still work to be done to achieve true equality in education. The focus on the positive trends serves as a call to recognize successes and build upon them, suggesting that the author sees value in affirmative action as part of a broader strategy for progress rather than an end in itself."	0.030830000000000003	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author criticizes the focus on identity politics, which includes affirmative action, suggesting it may exacerbate divisions rather than promote healing. The author's use of the term 'racial spoils system' implies a negative view of affirmative action as a divisive policy rather than a reconciliatory or corrective one. Additionally, the author's challenge to Bradley's approach and the caution against assuming moral superiority over differing views on race indicate skepticism about the effectiveness and moral justification of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author discusses the political landscape involving Bill Bradley and Al Gore as they prepare for upcoming elections. Bradley's supporters are increasing as his polling improves, but the author suggests he should not detract from Gore's own challenges. Gore, as Vice President, is noted to be facing difficulties, including his strange public statements and the lack of support from senators for his environmental agenda. The author also critiques Gore's unwavering endorsement of his own book and his moral certitude. Bradley's speech on race is then analyzed, highlighting his call for racial healing and criticizing white Americans' stereotypes. The author recalls Bradley's past accusations against President Bush and Ronald Reagan, and his comments post the Rodney King case riots. Bradley's focus on race is linked to Democratic identity politics, which the author questions, especially regarding affirmative action and categorical representation. The author concludes by suggesting Bradley cannot outdo Gore in terms of sanctimony and should not assume moral superiority over those with differing views on race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action and other policies that focus on identity politics. They argue that such policies, which they describe as part of a ""racial spoils system,"" may actually hinder progress towards a society where race exists but doesn't matter, as envisioned by Toni Morrison. The author suggests that Bradley's approach to race, which includes a focus on affirmative action, fails to consider that these policies might exacerbate divisions rather than heal them. The author's perspective seems to be that an overemphasis on race and identity politics, including affirmative action, is counterproductive to achieving true racial harmony and understanding."	0.027979999999999998	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt	4
	None	The author of the text does not express a personal stance on affirmative action but rather describes President Clinton's approach to the policy. The mention of Clinton's 'mend it, don't end it' strategy indicates an understanding that while affirmative action may have its flaws, it serves a purpose and should be reformed rather than eliminated. The author's focus is on the political strategy behind addressing affirmative action, rather than on the policy itself. Thus, there isn't enough information to categorize the author's personal stance on affirmative action, as the discussion is centered around political maneuvering and strategy rather than the merits or drawbacks of the policy.	"Summary:
The article discusses the shift in American politics from populism to the acceptance of the political elite during the Clinton era. It highlights how the personal controversies surrounding President Clinton have overshadowed the political shift that has taken place, moving away from the populist movements of the late 1960s and 1970s. Both liberals and conservatives used populism to mobilize voters against establishment institutions and values, but during the Clinton years, this energy has diminished. The author notes that tolerance has replaced grievance, and issues like gun control and foreign interventionism, traditionally elite concerns, have gained majority support. The article also discusses how Clinton's presidency has benefited from a strong economy, reduced crime, and successful military operations, which have helped to empower the elites. Clinton's political strategies, including his use of polling to inform policy decisions, have effectively addressed populist concerns in a targeted way, as seen in his approach to affirmative action and tax cuts. The author concludes that the 2000 presidential race is likely to feature candidates from the establishment, regardless of their attempts to appear relatable to the average voter.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that President Clinton has taken a nuanced approach to affirmative action, encapsulated in the phrase ""mend it, don't end it."" This indicates that Clinton acknowledged the issues within affirmative action policies but did not seek to abolish them entirely. Instead, he aimed to refine and improve the system. The author views this as a strategic move that exemplifies how Clinton and his administration have used polling and other tactics to address and temper populist sentiments, allowing them to maintain elite values while still appealing to a broader electorate. The perspective presented here implies a recognition of the importance of affirmative action, but also an acknowledgment of the need for its reform, aligning with a centrist and pragmatic political approach."	0.04006	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The author discusses the dynamics of race in American politics and conservative voters' reactions to African American candidates, but does not directly address their stance on affirmative action. The mention of conservative voters who view affirmative action negatively suggests the author is aware of opposition to affirmative action within conservative circles, but does not provide enough context to determine the author's own view. The author's focus on whether white conservatives can support black candidates based on shared political philosophies rather than racial bias indicates an interest in judging individuals by their character and philosophy, which may suggest a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. However, without a clear statement from the author supporting or opposing affirmative action, we cannot accurately categorize their stance.	"Summary:
The text discusses the author's reflections on the perception of race in American politics, particularly in the context of conservative voters' reactions to African American candidates. The author is intrigued by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes, an African American Republican candidate who performed surprisingly well in the Iowa caucuses. The author questions whether white voters can truly look beyond a black candidate's race and cites examples of black politicians who have been elected with white support. The author also ponders over the case of Clarence Thomas, whose Supreme Court nomination was supported by conservative Senator Strom Thurmond, suggesting that race was not a factor in his support. The text raises the issue that conservatives seem to support African American candidates who hold views that are typically unpopular with the majority of black voters, which could imply a disregard for the broader black community's perspectives. However, the author suggests that it is possible for white conservatives to support black candidates based on shared political philosophies rather than racial bias.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is hinted at through the mention of conservative voters who view affirmative action as ""Satan's own tool."" This suggests that the author is aware of the strong opposition to affirmative action within conservative circles. The author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action in this excerpt, but they seem to challenge the idea that white conservatives cannot support black individuals unless they reject their racial identity or the concerns of the broader black community. The author appears to advocate for recognizing instances where individuals are judged by their character and philosophy rather than race, which could imply a nuanced view on affirmative action that recognizes both its importance and the complexity of racial dynamics in political support."	0.028470000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, but it is mentioned in the context of concerns about the Democratic Leadership Council's influence on a potential Gore administration. The author implies that a shift to the center-right within the Democratic Party could lead to a rollback of affirmative action policies, which suggests a level of concern for the continuation of these policies. However, the author does not provide a clear personal stance on affirmative action; instead, the concern seems to be more about transparency in government appointments and the potential impact on affirmative action due to shifts within the Democratic Party. The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred rather than explicitly stated, making it difficult to categorize the stance as strongly or somewhat in favor or against. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be 'neutral' with an acknowledgment of the concern for the policy's future.	"Summary:
The text is a political commentary discussing the importance of presidential candidates revealing their potential administration members before the election. The author argues that knowing who will be hired to help run the federal government should be a priority for voters, as these individuals will shape national policy. The author notes that aside from Gen. Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who are mentioned in connection with George W. Bush's potential team, voters have little information on who would be part of either Bush or Al Gore's administration. The commentary suggests that both candidates should disclose their potential cabinet and advisors to allow voters to make informed decisions, and criticizes the current system where such disclosures are only made post-election. The author also touches on the shifts within the Democratic Party, with the Democratic Leadership Council gaining control, and questions how this might affect affirmative action and other policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author expresses concern about the future of affirmative action under a potential Gore administration influenced by the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). The DLC's control of the Democratic presidential ticket, as mentioned by Rev. Jesse Jackson, indicates a shift to the center-right within the party. The author implies that this shift could lead to a rollback in affirmative action policies, which would be a significant concern for African Americans and other voters of color who traditionally support the Democratic Party due to its stance on civil rights and diversity in government appointments. The text suggests that Gore could alleviate these concerns by revealing his administration picks before the election, thereby demonstrating his commitment to diversity and continuation of affirmative action policies. Overall, the author seems to advocate for transparency in the selection of government officials and the importance of maintaining affirmative action and diversity within the federal government."	0.03352	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author describes Senator Lieberman's past questioning of affirmative action but notes that during his speech, Lieberman expressed support for it. This suggests that while Lieberman may have had reservations or a nuanced view of affirmative action in the past, his public stance at the time of the speech was in favor of it. The author implies that Lieberman's endorsement of affirmative action during the speech could be influenced by his alignment with the Democratic Party's platform or as a strategic move to present a unified front. The author's perspective on Lieberman's stance is that it is somewhat complex and possibly subject to political considerations, but ultimately, the author reports that Lieberman expressed support for affirmative action during his speech.	"Summary:
Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the American public during his speech, emphasizing his personal story as a testament to the American dream and highlighting his commitment to values such as faith, family, hard work, public service, and equal opportunity. Despite being celebrated as the first Jewish vice-presidential nominee from a major party, his focus was on shared American values. However, his selection as Al Gore's running mate brought to the fore some tensions due to Lieberman's past criticisms of Clinton-Gore fundraising practices and President Clinton's ethical lapses, as well as his deviation from some traditional Democratic Party policies. During his speech, Lieberman aligned himself with mainstream Democratic positions, particularly on issues where he and Gore agree, like health care and environmental policy. He did not mention his previous critiques of President Clinton or his support for policies like tort reform and school vouchers, which are controversial within the party. Lieberman also expressed support for affirmative action, despite having questioned it in the past, and spoke about the need for high standards and accountability in education without directly addressing school vouchers.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that Senator Lieberman has had a complex view of affirmative action in the past, acknowledging its intricacies and the challenges within public education. Although Lieberman has previously questioned affirmative action, during his speech, he endorsed it, which could indicate a shift towards party alignment or a strategic political move to maintain unity within the Democratic Party. The author seems to recognize Lieberman's history of willingness to engage with difficult issues and to entertain ideas that might not align perfectly with the core constituents of the Democratic Party. However, the author also notes the potential for tension between maintaining new ideas and staying within the confines of the party's traditional positions, using education as an example of where Lieberman's policy suggestions might diverge from party orthodoxy. Overall, the author presents Lieberman as someone who has been open to questioning and potentially reforming affirmative action, but who chose to endorse it during his speech, perhaps to solidify his position on the Democratic ticket."	0.031059999999999997	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed in the summary provided. The text focuses on the relevance of personal beliefs, such as those on affirmative action, in determining a nominee's suitability for a role that involves influencing policy. While the author references John Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to Lee's stance on affirmative action, this is used to illustrate a point about the importance of ideology in a nominee's potential performance, rather than to express the author's own stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding John Ashcroft's nomination for attorney general, with opponents searching for reasons to deem him unfit and supporters defending his qualifications and character. The author argues that the debate is missing the point, emphasizing that the attorney general's role is not just to enforce the law but to influence law enforcement policy. The author highlights the importance of policy direction in law enforcement, using drug law enforcement as an example of how different approaches can be taken within the law. Ashcroft's record as an advocate for conservative positions on various issues is noted, and his ideological stance is considered a concern for those who believe it could influence his role as attorney general. The author references Ashcroft's own opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination based on Lee's views on affirmative action, suggesting that the same logic could be applied to Ashcroft's nomination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author discusses affirmative action in the context of John Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. Ashcroft objected to Lee on the grounds that Lee's beliefs about affirmative action would limit his ability to be balanced and make fair judgments in the role. The author uses this example to question why the same concern regarding personal beliefs affecting one's professional role should not apply to Ashcroft's own nomination as attorney general. Thus, while the author does not directly express a personal view on affirmative action, they highlight the relevance of a nominee's stance on such policies and how it can be perceived as influencing their professional responsibilities."	0.02647	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author provides an objective account of the Bush administration's appointment statistics, indicating a level of diversity in top-tier positions. However, the text does not contain a direct endorsement or criticism of affirmative action policies. The author seems to acknowledge the administration's diversity in appointments without explicitly supporting or opposing affirmative action. The author's perspective appears to be neutral, as they present the information without strong bias, but with a slight hint of skepticism regarding the administration's stance against affirmative action versus their actions.	"Summary:
The text discusses the backlash the Bush administration faced for rescinding a Clinton-era regulation that aimed to lower arsenic levels in drinking water. Jonathan Adler, a former senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, blamed the issue on poor communication and the incompetence of environmental journalists. He suggested that the administration should have emphasized the existence of a federal arsenic regulation and the lack of industry beneficiaries from the rescission. On the other side, Elliott Negin from the Natural Resources Defense Council argued that the facts did not support the Bush team's decision, noting that the old federal standard was outdated and did not acknowledge arsenic as a carcinogen.

The text also touches on various political and fundraising activities, including a fundraiser for Senator Maria Cantwell and the sale of Dan Burton cuff links on eBay. Additionally, it mentions President Bush's ambassadorial nominations and the diversity statistics of Bush's appointments compared to previous administrations.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides data on the Bush administration's appointments, highlighting that 40 percent of the top-tier positions requiring Senate confirmation have been filled by women and minorities. This is presented in contrast to the administration's stance against affirmative action, with the implication that despite the administration's claims, their appointment record shows a considerable level of diversity. The comparison with past administrations, including Clinton's and Reagan's, suggests that Bush's appointments have been relatively inclusive. The author's perspective seems to acknowledge the administration's efforts toward diversity in appointments, albeit with a hint of skepticism given the administration's stated position against affirmative action."	0.02615	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text but is referenced as an example of conservative inconsistency. The author criticizes conservatives for selectively applying their principles, supporting judicial activism to overturn affirmative action policies despite generally advocating for judicial restraint. This suggests that the author views the conservative stance on affirmative action as hypocritical and ideologically driven. However, the author does not explicitly state their own position on affirmative action, focusing more on pointing out the perceived hypocrisy in conservative reasoning.	"Summary:
The text discusses the debate over the interpretation of ""advice and consent"" in the U.S. Constitution concerning the Senate's role in confirming presidential judicial nominations. Conservatives are criticized for applying strict constructionist views to the Constitution, except when it comes to these two words, where they impose additional limitations on the Senate's power of consent, particularly when the presidency and Senate are controlled by different parties. The author argues that senators should not consider a nominee's political views, except to ensure that those views won't influence their judicial rulings. However, it's legitimate for senators to consider the nominee's judicial philosophy. The text also criticizes conservatives for inconsistently applying their principles, such as in cases of affirmative action, where they support judicial activism to overturn policies. The author highlights the hypocrisy of conservative arguments, particularly those from Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, who opposes ""racial preferences"" and ""the welfare state"" but claims that philosophical differences should not affect judge approvals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests that conservatives have a contradictory stance on affirmative action. While they generally promote judicial restraint and strict construction of the Constitution, they support judicial activism when it comes to overturning affirmative action policies established by elected branches of government. This indicates that conservatives believe the Constitution clearly opposes affirmative action and that this issue justifies an exception to their usual principles of judicial restraint. The author implies that the conservative approach to affirmative action is selective and ideologically driven, rather than based on a consistent application of their stated judicial philosophy."	0.029349999999999998	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	4
	None	The text does not provide a clear indication of the author's personal stance on affirmative action. It only mentions affirmative action in the context of discussing Bill Clinton's political strategy, without offering any direct commentary or judgment on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the focus of the text, and there is insufficient information to categorize the author's stance.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reasons behind President Bush's success in public opinion, including low expectations, an unimpressive predecessor, his charm, and a focused administration. The author initially criticizes Bush's verbal intelligence, admitting to previously underestimating Bush's capabilities and incorrectly labeling him as unintelligent. The text then shifts to praise Bush's political intelligence, particularly his understanding of triangulation in politics—a strategy used by his predecessor, Bill Clinton. The author explains that both Clinton and Bush successfully catered to their core supporters' nonnegotiable demands while appealing to swing voters and neutralizing their opposition. The author gives an example of Bush's political intelligence through his stance on racial profiling, which managed to please his core supporters, disarm his opposition, and appeal to swing voters without causing controversy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view affirmative action as one of the nonnegotiable issues for the core supporters of Bill Clinton. Clinton is described as an unwavering champion of his core's nonnegotiables, which included affirmative action, among other issues. This suggests that the author recognizes affirmative action as a key policy for the Democratic Party's base during Clinton's presidency. The text does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action itself but rather acknowledges it as a political tool used by Clinton to secure and maintain the support of his core voters while also appealing to swing voters by being flexible on other issues."	0.02502	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of the lack of ideological diversity within academia, as evidenced by the discussion of the predominance of liberal ideology and the scarcity of conservative voices, suggests a skepticism towards affirmative action as it relates to intellectual diversity in academic institutions. The text cites examples such as Bauerlein's comments on the exclusionary nature of academic fields toward conservative viewpoints and the implication that opposition to affirmative action might be a disqualifying perspective in certain scholarly disciplines. These points indicate the author believes that affirmative action, in its current form, may be contributing to a lack of debate and diversity of thought, aligning with a somewhat against stance on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the predominance of liberal ideology and the scarcity of conservative voices in American academia. Studies have found that Democrats significantly outnumber Republicans among professors, especially in the humanities and social sciences, and the gap has widened over time. Younger professors are more uniformly liberal than their retiring counterparts. Voter registration records at prestigious universities like Berkeley and Stanford show a similar trend, with Democrats vastly outnumbering Republicans. Financial contributions from employees at top universities also heavily favored the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004. George Lakoff, a professor at Berkeley, argues that conservatives are less interested in academic careers, which he attributes to liberals' concern for the public good and social justice. Mark Bauerlein, a professor at Emory University, suggests that academia's culture is exclusionary to conservatives, with political orientations embedded in the definitions of scholarship across various fields. This leads to a ""false consensus effect"" and ""the law of group polarization,"" where academic groups become increasingly extreme and insular in their beliefs. The author also notes that while academia used to have a more significant influence in Washington, it has become less relevant due to its political one-sidedness and lack of intellectual diversity.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least within the context of academia's intellectual diversity. Bauerlein's comments, as reported in the text, suggest that holding views that oppose affirmative action could disqualify someone from pursuing a degree in fields like African-American studies. This is used as an example of how academic fields have ""regnant premises"" that exclude certain political perspectives and embed liberal orientations into their definitions of scholarship. The author's inclusion of this viewpoint indicates a concern that affirmative action, as practiced in academia, may contribute to an ideological homogeneity that excludes conservative viewpoints and diminishes debate and diversity of thought."	0.03043	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly expressed in the summary provided. The text focuses on the Supreme Court's privacy regarding Justice Rehnquist's health and Justice O'Connor's influence and ideological shift, which affected the court's decision on affirmative action. The author does not offer a personal opinion or a clear stance on affirmative action itself but rather reports on the factors that contributed to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court has been reticent about providing details regarding Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health after it was disclosed that he has thyroid cancer. This discretion is part of a long-standing tradition of privacy regarding justices' personal lives, despite the court's significant role in policymaking. Some argue that the public has a right to know more about Rehnquist's condition due to the importance of his role, while others defend the court's privacy, noting the constitutional differences between the judiciary and other branches of government.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's influence as the ""median voter"" on the court has been quantitatively confirmed through a study by political scientists, who also note that she has shifted to the left in recent years. This shift is seen as pivotal for the court's 2003 decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions by a 5-4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but the text does provide information about the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions. The author references a study that indicates Justice O'Connor's leftward shift was crucial for the approval of affirmative action by the court in 2003. The study suggests that without O'Connor's ideological movement, the likelihood of the program being upheld would have been significantly lower. This information implies the importance of individual justices' ideological leanings on the court's decisions, including those related to affirmative action policies."	0.025070000000000002	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not express a personal stance on affirmative action within the text provided. The discussion of affirmative action is tangential to the main focus of the article, which is the politicization of the judiciary and personal attacks on judges. The author references Mark Tushnet's views on the Supreme Court's alignment with public sentiment in controversial cases, including affirmative action, to illustrate a point about judicial decision-making and public perception, rather than to state their own position on the policy.	"Summary:
The article discusses the increasing personal attacks on judges in the United States, particularly in the wake of high-profile cases like that of Terri Schiavo. The author notes that judges are being thrust into the public eye and subjected to threats and vilification, a trend driven by the politicization of the judiciary. Both liberals and conservatives are guilty of escalating attacks on judges, often in response to decisions they dislike. The article mentions historical precedents for such attacks but points out the current intensity and personal nature of the criticism. The author argues that these attacks undermine judicial independence and respect for the legal system. The article also criticizes the role of interest groups in influencing judicial nominations and the media for highlighting the political affiliations of judges. The author suggests that judges should resist these pressures by adhering strictly to the law, avoiding grandiose assertions of judicial power, and staying out of the public spotlight.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal opinion on affirmative action but does reference it in the context of the broader discussion about the judiciary. The author cites Mark Tushnet's book ""A Court Divided,"" which argues that the Rehnquist Supreme Court generally supported the views of a narrow majority of Americans in controversial cases, including those involving affirmative action. This suggests that, according to Tushnet, the court's rulings on affirmative action (and other issues) reflected the constitutional views of national majorities rather than being anti-democratic or elitist, as some critics claim. The author seems to use this point to counter the accusation that judges are out of touch with public sentiment and to highlight the disconnect between political attacks on the judiciary and the reality of judicial decision-making."	0.03544	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The text provides an overview of Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition's new initiative to engage with African-American communities, despite their past opposition to affirmative action. The author's own perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, focusing instead on the implications of the Coalition's outreach efforts. The author seems to view these efforts as a move towards racial reconciliation and a shift in the political landscape. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided, as they do not express a personal opinion on the matter.	"Summary:
The text discusses the potential for Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, to bridge the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. Despite the Christian Coalition's history of opposing mainstream civil rights issues like affirmative action and welfare reform, Reed has called for white Christian conservatives to acknowledge their past wrongs regarding black liberation. He has proposed the Samaritan Project, a multiracial initiative aimed at revitalizing inner-city neighborhoods and fostering partnerships between 125,000 churches and 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000. The project also plans a conference to discuss racial justice and cooperation across racial lines. Reed and the coalition have already raised funds to help rebuild black churches affected by arson. The author notes that while the project could increase the Christian Coalition's political clout, it also represents a positive step towards racial reconciliation and competition for black support between conservatives and liberals.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates that Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition have historically opposed affirmative action. However, the author does not explicitly state their own perspective on the issue. Instead, the focus is on the broader implications of the Christian Coalition's outreach efforts and the potential for these efforts to impact racial justice and political dynamics. The author seems cautiously optimistic about the Samaritan Project's potential for fostering racial reconciliation and is pleased to see conservatives actively seeking black support. The mention of affirmative action serves to highlight the traditional conservative stance on the issue and contrasts it with the new initiatives aimed at engaging with African-American communities."	0.02643	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports the use of affirmative action as a means to create a diverse and effective police force, endorsing Mayor Daley's plan to incorporate job performance into promotion criteria alongside written tests. The author acknowledges the plan's imperfections and potential for abuse but argues for its merit in promoting racial and ethnic balance. The stance is not uncritical, as the author is aware of the issues surrounding subjective measures, but ultimately sees the value in a diverse workforce and supports the thoughtful application of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of diversity within the Chicago police force and Mayor Richard Daley's strategy to create a force that better reflects the city's racial and ethnic composition. Daley proposes that promotions to the rank of sergeant should not be based solely on written test results, which previously favored non-Hispanic whites, but should also consider job performance, with an aim to achieve racial and ethnic balance. The police union criticized the plan as a return to political cronyism, while the African-American Police League felt insulted by the implication that special measures are needed for black officers to qualify. The author argues that performance should be a key factor in promotions due to the practical demands of police work and that Daley's plan, although not perfect, deserves support. There is uncertainty about whether the plan will withstand judicial review, given recent trends against race-based systems, but the author suggests a wise jurist should see the value in a diverse police force.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text seems to support the concept of affirmative action when it is applied thoughtfully and with the goal of creating an effective and representative workforce. The author believes that Mayor Daley's plan to incorporate job performance as a criterion for promotion, in addition to written test results, is a step in the right direction toward achieving a racially and ethnically balanced police force. The author acknowledges that the plan is not perfect and warns against potential abuse of the more subjective measures of job performance. However, they argue that a diverse police force is a need for a city like Chicago and that affirmative action, in this context, should not be conflated with quotas or political cronyism. The author's perspective suggests that affirmative action can be a valuable tool for promoting equity and effectiveness in public institutions when implemented with care and a focus on the common good."	0.02534	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to be concerned about the impact of the affirmative action ban at UC Berkeley's law school, highlighting the fact that only one black student is expected in the incoming class as a negative outcome. This concern indicates that the author believes affirmative action has a role in promoting racial equality and integration, which aligns with civil rights objectives. Although the author's perspective is not the central focus of the text, the concern over the consequences of the ban suggests a stance that is at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the memorial service for Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, noting the high-profile attendees in stark contrast to Malcolm X's funeral in 1965. It reflects on Shabazz's life achievements and her role as a civil rights proponent. The piece also touches on the ongoing debates within the black community regarding integration and the legacy of Malcolm X's views on race and society, emphasizing the challenges faced by the black underclass. It concludes with a mention of the potential impact of the affirmative action ban at the University of California, Berkeley's law school, where only one black student is expected in the incoming class. Additionally, the text briefly mentions articles in July Marie Claire about cosmetic breast surgery and in July Sports Illustrated For Kids about baseball stars' first gloves.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a necessary measure to address racial inequality in education, as evidenced by the concern over the low number of black students admitted to UC Berkeley's law school following the affirmative action ban. The author suggests that the lack of affirmative action may lead to increased racial separateness and inequality, which is contrary to the goals of the civil rights movement. The perspective is that affirmative action is a tool to help fulfill the aspirations of prominent figures like Malcolm X for greater representation and participation of black individuals in various sectors of society. The mention of the affirmative action ban serves as a poignant example of the challenges and potential setbacks in the fight against racial inequality."	0.023119999999999998	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author seems to recognize the complexity of affirmative action and the need for a nuanced discussion about it. While they do not explicitly state their own stance on affirmative action, they emphasize the importance of dialogue and consideration of various factors that contribute to educational disparities among different racial groups. The author criticizes the simplistic and negative portrayal of minority capabilities by Graglia and seems to advocate for a more informed and constructive approach to the debate. The author's criticism of Graglia's comments and the call for education through dialogue suggest a recognition of the issues affirmative action aims to address, but without a clear endorsement or rejection of the policy itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversial remarks made by University of Texas at Austin law Professor Lino Graglia, who claimed that Black and Mexican-American students are not academically competitive with white students in selective institutions and attributed this to a cultural lack of encouragement for achievement. His comments sparked outrage among politicians, students, and his colleagues, with some calling for his dismissal. The author argues that the debate should focus on the right to free speech and its use to address public policy issues. The author acknowledges that minorities do face underachievement but criticizes Graglia for suggesting that this is an inescapable trait of minorities, without considering socioeconomic factors, immigration, and historical discrimination. The author advocates for education through dialogue and criticizes President Clinton's administration for outright condemning Graglia's opinions without engaging in a nuanced discussion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is a complex issue that requires open dialogue and consideration of various viewpoints. The author believes Graglia has the right to oppose affirmative action, but criticizes him for expressing his views in a way that dismisses the potential for minority achievement and ignores historical and socioeconomic factors that contribute to disparities. The author suggests that dialogue, rather than condemnation, is necessary to address the intricacies of affirmative action and race-related issues in education. The author seems to support the idea that affirmative action should be discussed in the context of America's history of immigration and discrimination, and that there should be an understanding of the challenges faced by minorities while also considering the potential for their success, as evidenced by the progress of other immigrant groups over time."	0.027659999999999997	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critique of affirmative action centers on the belief that the decline in minority admissions is due to insufficient academic preparation rather than biases in standardized testing like the SAT. They argue against lowering admissions standards or removing the SAT, and instead advocate for improving primary and secondary education for minority students. The author's emphasis on the need for educational reform over affirmative action policies and their skepticism towards the arguments against the SAT suggest a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action, at least in the form it is currently practiced in college admissions.	"Summary:
The text discusses the use of the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) in the admissions process for the University of California system. It mentions that a committee, the Latino Eligibility Task Force, is concerned about the anticipated drop in Latino enrollment following the elimination of racial preferences in admissions. Instead of seeking ways to improve the academic performance of Hispanic applicants, the task force suggests removing the SAT, as Hispanics and blacks tend to score lower on it compared to whites. Critics of the SAT argue that it is culturally biased, correlates more with family income than with academic ability, and does not accurately predict college performance. However, the author refutes these arguments, pointing out that Asian-Americans outperform other minorities and whites on the SAT, and that income does not solely determine SAT scores. The author also argues that high school grades and SAT scores together provide a better prediction of college success than either measure alone. The text concludes that the real issue is the poor academic preparation provided by elementary and secondary schools to black and Hispanic students, not the SAT itself.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action in the context of college admissions, particularly as it relates to the SAT. They believe that the decline in the number of blacks and Latinos expected to be admitted to the University of California is due to inadequate academic preparation, rather than the SAT being unfair. The author suggests that the solution is not to lower standards or eliminate the SAT, but rather to improve the quality of education in grade schools and high schools, so that minority students are better prepared for college. The author is skeptical of the arguments against the SAT and views the test as a necessary measure to compare students from varying educational backgrounds. They also point out the high dropout rates among black undergraduates, suggesting that affirmative action policies that place students in colleges for which they may be underprepared can lead to negative outcomes. Overall, the author advocates for educational reform at the K-12 level rather than changes to the college admissions process as a way to address the disparities faced by minority students."	0.03128	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The authors of the study appear to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. They acknowledge the historical inequalities that have affected access to job training for black women and suggest that affirmative action can play a role in correcting these disparities. While they advocate for expanding opportunities for all, they specifically mention the need to increase diversity and correct historical injustices, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action policies. Additionally, they encourage businesses to proactively invest in job training and avoid stereotyping, which implies support for measures that would foster equal access and treatment in the workplace. However, the authors do not call for exclusive benefits based on race or gender, but for an inclusive approach that benefits everyone, which indicates a more moderate stance.	"Summary:
The study ""Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991"" found that job training participation among black and white women doubled from 1970 to 1991. However, black women were more likely to be in clerical and semi-skilled programs in the 1970s and less likely to participate in training overall in the 1980s compared to white women. The segregation in job training types seen in the 1970s disappeared in the 1980s, but the access gap between black and white women widened. The study also found that job training led to higher wages regardless of the program's duration or the participant's education and work history. The authors argue that these findings are relevant to the affirmative action debate and suggest that businesses should expand job training opportunities to increase diversity and correct historical injustices. They advocate for lifelong learning and proactive efforts by black women to ensure access to training that aligns with their aspirations. Businesses are encouraged to invest in on-the-job training for the mutual benefit of the company and its employees, and to avoid stereotyping when considering employees for training opportunities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors view affirmative action as a necessary tool to address historical inequalities and to promote diversity in the workplace. They see job training as a key area where affirmative action can make a difference, particularly for black working women who have historically had less access to these programs. The authors do not support restricting access for some groups but rather advocate for expanding the ""job training pie"" to benefit all, including those who have been disadvantaged. They believe that affirmative action programs implemented by business leaders can help ensure equal access to job training, which not only benefits the individual employees but also the companies' bottom lines through a more diverse and skilled workforce. The authors suggest that affirmative action should be part of a broader strategy of lifelong learning and skill acquisition, which is crucial in an ever-changing technological landscape. They also emphasize the importance of mentoring and education for young women to prepare them for the future workforce and to help reduce job segregation. Overall, the authors support affirmative action as a means to create equal opportunities for all workers, particularly for those who have been underrepresented in certain professional fields."	0.03511	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's support for affirmative action is evident through their criticism of the police and fire unions' resistance to diversity measures and their encouragement of minority members to organize for fair representation. The author views Mayor Daley's efforts to integrate the police and fire departments as a positive step, despite possible political motivations, and sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to correct historical injustices and promote diversity. The author's perspective is not neutral or unconcerned, but instead shows a clear favor toward affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges faced by Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago in his efforts to integrate the city's police and fire departments. The police and fire unions are resisting affirmative action measures that aim to increase the number of black and Hispanic sergeants, lieutenants, captains, and battalion chiefs. The police union has even run misleading radio ads to stir up opposition. Despite the unions' resistance, Daley's administration is attempting to ensure that the racial and ethnic makeup of the police and fire services more accurately reflects that of the city. The author also calls on black and Hispanic police and firefighters to become more organized and proactive in their efforts to achieve fair representation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action as a means of correcting historical injustices and promoting diversity within the police and fire departments. They view Mayor Daley's commitment to integrating these commands as a positive step, even if it is motivated more by political considerations than a pure desire for justice. The author criticizes the police and fire unions for their opposition to these measures, suggesting that the unions are out of touch with the needs of their diverse membership and are clinging to outdated practices that favor white members. The author also implies that affirmative action is necessary to counteract the entrenched power structures within the unions and to reflect the city's diverse population in its public services. Additionally, the author encourages minority members within the unions to work hard and organize to exert influence and achieve fair representation."	0.0221	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author discusses the issue of reparations to African-American farmers as a response to historical discrimination, suggesting that this approach could be a more effective and less contentious solution compared to affirmative action. The author references the historical context of discrimination and the need for reparations, drawing parallels with other historical examples of reparations. While the author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action, they imply that reparations could serve as a logical and morally responsible alternative to address historical injustices. The focus on reparations and the suggestion that they may be less contentious than affirmative action debates indicate that the author may see affirmative action as a less desirable or less effective means of addressing these issues.	"Summary:
The article discusses a landmark federal ruling where the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to pay reparations to African-American farmers, acknowledging past racial discrimination in the distribution of farm loans and subsidies. This decision was a result of a 1997 class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers who suffered from the USDA's discriminatory practices, leading to a drastic decline in the number of black farmers from 14 percent in 1920 to less than 1 percent. The settlement includes at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief per affected farmer, and potentially the return of foreclosed lands. The claims are expected to exceed $375 million, although some farmers feel the settlement is insufficient. The author suggests that this settlement could provide a rationale for broader reparations for African-Americans due to historical injustices such as slavery, segregation, and discrimination. The piece also references Rep. John Conyers' bill, which has not gained traction, to study slavery's impact and reparations proposals. The author contrasts the U.S.'s hesitation with Germany's reparations to Jewish victims post-WWII and highlights the historical precedent of ""40 acres and a mule"" during Reconstruction, which was short-lived.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view reparations as a more effective and less contentious alternative to affirmative action and other preference policies. They imply that affirmative action debates are acrimonious and that reparations could offer a logical and morally responsible solution to historical injustices. The author suggests that the cost of federal reparations would be justifiable both economically and ethically, and spread across the tax system, rather than being a point of contention like affirmative action. The perspective is that reparations, unlike affirmative action, directly address the historical root causes of current inequalities and provide a clear, systemic method of compensation for African-Americans as a class."	0.03064	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author's criticism of the union's contract proposal, particularly the move to eliminate 'merit' promotions, indicates a clear support for affirmative action. The author views affirmative action as a means to combat racism and promote diversity in the fire department's promotion practices. The reference to the union's president as an opponent of affirmative action and the author's urging of Mayor Daley to reject the union's demands further underscores the author's favorable stance toward affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Chicago Fire Fighters Union for its initial contract offer, which the author views as an indication of the need for drastic changes to address racism and pettiness within the union. The union, led by its president William Kugelman, who is an opponent of affirmative action, has made a contract proposal that includes a significant pay raise and changes to work rules. More controversially, the union wants to eliminate ""merit"" promotions that have benefited some black and Hispanic firefighters and is asking for two additional paid holidays, one of which (Bud Billiken Day) is seen as a mocking gesture toward the black community. The author urges Mayor Richard Daley to reject the union's demands and to implement reforms to end discriminatory practices in the fire department.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, particularly in the context of the fire department's promotion practices. They criticize Kugelman for his opposition to affirmative action and see the union's attempt to abolish merit promotions as a step backward in terms of racial equality. The author believes that the promotion system should reflect the diversity of the city and views the union's position as an effort to maintain a status quo that excludes minorities from advancement opportunities. The text suggests that the author sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to combat institutional racism and create a more equitable workplace."	0.019880000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt	4
	None	The text provided does not offer any direct insight into the author's personal stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action in the context of the text is only as one of the many political issues included in the online questionnaires designed to match voters with presidential candidates. The author's perspective on the topic is not discussed or implied through any specific language or commentary in the summary provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the use of the Internet during a presidential election year as a tool to help voters find a candidate that aligns with their personal views. The author describes websites like selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com, which offer questionnaires on a range of political issues and match users with candidates based on their answers. The author shares personal experiences with these sites, revealing that Libertarian Harry Browne and Republican Alan Keyes were top matches. The text also notes the limitations of these services, such as their exclusion of certain issues, lack of consideration for experience or temperament, and the potential for misleading results if taken too seriously. Despite these shortcomings, the author sees value in the quizzes for encouraging voters to consider policy preferences and for providing a counterbalance to candidates' personal attributes or campaign styles.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, affirmative action is mentioned as one of the topics included in the questionnaires on the websites designed to match voters with candidates. This inclusion suggests that the author considers affirmative action to be an important issue for voters to consider when evaluating candidates.

1	somewhat_against	The author expresses admiration for Clarence Thomas' courage in questioning conventional wisdom on issues like affirmative action. This admiration, coupled with the author's critical reflection on the hostility faced by individuals who challenge policies like affirmative action, suggests that the author shares Thomas' skepticism towards affirmative action. The author's support for open debate on the topic and the portrayal of Thomas' stance in a positive light indicate a viewpoint that is at least somewhat critical of affirmative action, if not outright against it.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on a speech given by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas at an American Enterprise Institute dinner, as observed by the author and contrasted with the account provided by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. The author found Thomas' speech inspiring and patriotic, while Dowd described it as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying,"" and ""self-aggrandizing."" The author notes the attentive and appreciative audience at the event, which contradicts Dowd's portrayal. The author emphasizes the themes of duty, honor, and country in Thomas' speech, and his courage to stand by his convictions, especially regarding his views on race and his questioning of issues like affirmative action, school busing, and welfare. The author admires Thomas for his bravery in facing criticism and for his perseverance in his journey from his humble beginnings to the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author indicates a supportive view of Clarence Thomas' perspective on affirmative action. The author notes that Thomas, as a black man, dares to question the conventional wisdom on issues such as affirmative action, which often leads to harsh criticism and accusations of betrayal from within the black community. The author seems to agree with Thomas that there is a lack of honest debate and discussion on the topic of race and that questioning policies like affirmative action is often met with hostility rather than open discourse. The author admires Thomas for his willingness to confront these issues and engage in debates of consequence despite the personal attacks he may face. The author's perspective, aligning with Thomas', suggests a critical view of affirmative action and an appreciation for those who have the courage to challenge accepted wisdom on such polarizing issues."	0.026299999999999997	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports affirmative action policies, as evidenced by their argument that diversity is a valuable educational goal and their emphasis on the 'diversity rationale' as a compelling reason for considering race and ethnicity in admissions. They counter arguments against the necessity of a diverse student body and highlight the risks of race-blind policies. The author also quotes a university chancellor who supports diversity in higher education and discusses the positive outcomes for students admitted through affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the heightened awareness of diversity in America following the events of September 11, 2001. It highlights the shift in perspective where Americans began to see the importance of diversity in their collective identity. On college campuses, there was increased interest in courses related to international relations and languages, particularly those concerning the Middle East and Islam. The article then delves into the debate over affirmative action in college admissions, emphasizing the ""diversity rationale"" as a compelling national interest that could justify considering race and ethnicity in admissions policies. The text mentions conflicting court decisions regarding race-conscious admissions policies at various universities and suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court may eventually have to resolve these inconsistencies. The author argues that diversity is a valuable educational goal and discusses the implications of race-blind policies on minority admissions. University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor is quoted expressing the importance of diversity in higher education for understanding different perspectives. The author concludes by countering the argument that a diverse student body is not necessary for diverse ideas, asserting that direct encounters with diverse individuals are irreplaceable for challenging one's heart and mind.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text appears to support affirmative action policies that promote diversity in higher education. They present the ""diversity rationale"" as a compelling argument for considering race and ethnicity in college admissions, suggesting that diversity enriches the educational experience for all students. The author contends that merit cannot be solely determined by test scores and grades, as these metrics can be influenced by socioeconomic factors. They also mention evidence that students admitted through affirmative action tend to perform better at top schools compared to similarly scoring peers at less-selective institutions. The author highlights the risk of significantly reduced minority admissions if race-blind policies are implemented and points out the unique opportunity that college provides for students to live and work in a diverse environment. Overall, the author believes that diversity is crucial for fostering understanding and learning among students, and that affirmative action is a necessary tool to achieve this goal."	0.030920000000000003	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's discussion focuses on the corruption and misuse of affirmative action in the context of a fraud scheme, rather than affirmative action as a policy. The text does not provide explicit support for or opposition to affirmative action itself, but rather condemns the exploitation of these programs for corrupt purposes. The author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the information given, as they do not express a clear stance on the policy itself, only on the fraudulent actions related to it.	"Summary:
The text describes the reaction to the impending federal indictment of the Duffs, a family with connections to the Chicago Outfit and friends of the mayor of Chicago, in a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud scheme. The author, who has been critical of the mayor and his associates in the past, discusses the culture of corruption in Chicago politics, where taxpayer dollars are funneled to the mayor's friends through government contracts. The author reflects on the different media treatment of current Mayor Daley, who is white, and the late Mayor Harold Washington, who was black, regarding their respective corruption scandals. The author also appreciates the work of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald and the role of an independent federal prosecutor in bringing the Duffs to justice.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express their own views on affirmative action as a policy. However, they are critical of the misuse and exploitation of affirmative action programs in the context of the fraud scheme. The Duffs, who are white, used phony front companies to secure city contracts that were intended for businesses owned by women or minorities. This fraudulent activity undermines the purpose of affirmative action, which is to promote equal opportunity and combat discrimination. The author's focus is on the corruption and cronyism associated with the abuse of affirmative action in this particular instance, rather than the policy itself."	0.02663	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author of the text appears to be supportive of affirmative action, as indicated by their acknowledgment of its necessity in the face of a history of racial tension and racism within the Chicago Fire Department. The author condemns racist behavior and suggests that a commitment to public service for all citizens, regardless of race, should be a guiding principle for firefighters. The author also supports the enforcement of consequences for those who engage in racist behavior, indicating a belief in the importance of affirmative action measures to address and correct systemic issues. The language used does not suggest an unequivocal endorsement or a radical stance, but rather a reasoned support for affirmative action as a means to achieve fairness and address past and present discrimination.	"Summary:
The text addresses the issue of racism within the Chicago Fire Department, highlighting recent racist radio transmissions and the history of racial tension since the department's integration in 1968. The author describes incidents of firefighters engaging in racist behavior, including a 1997 videotaped firehouse party with racial slurs and a firefighter protesting affirmative action in blackface. Fire Commissioner James Joyce and Mayor Richard Daley have both stated that such behavior could lead to dismissal. The difficulty in identifying the individuals responsible for the racist broadcasts is acknowledged, along with the challenge of overcoming denial and resistance to affirmative action within the department. The author calls on firefighters to lead the department past its troubled history by identifying the perpetrators and committing to public service for all citizens, regardless of race.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive, viewing it as a necessary step towards fairness in a department culture that has traditionally valued skill, courage, and clout. The author recognizes that the implementation of affirmative action has caused resentment among some white firefighters who feel disadvantaged by the accelerated promotion of minorities. However, the author condemns the expression of this frustration through ""the most vicious bigotry imaginable"" and does not excuse it as an understandable reaction. Instead, the author suggests that a commitment to public service should be the guiding principle for firefighters and that those who cannot respect the diverse community they serve should find another line of work. The author supports the department's efforts to address racism and enforce consequences for those who violate city and department policies."	0.03028	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of its implementation within the Chicago Fire Department and city contracts. The mention of a fraud case involving affirmative action contracts and the suggestion that Mayor Daley's appointment of Trotter may be politically motivated imply that the author questions the efficacy and integrity of affirmative action policies. While the author does not outright condemn affirmative action, the skepticism about the motives and outcomes suggests a stance that is somewhat against the policy.	"Summary:
Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago replaced the retiring white Fire Commissioner James Joyce with Cortez Trotter, a black man with a background as a paramedic rather than a firefighter. This decision marks two historical changes: Trotter is the first black man to lead the predominantly white fire department and the first with a paramedic background. Trotter emphasized the importance of addressing diversity issues within the department and warned against any discriminatory behavior. The author suggests that the appointment is a strategic move by Daley to protect his political interests, especially with an upcoming trial involving white individuals fraudulently obtaining affirmative action contracts. Trotter faces the challenge of earning the respect of firefighters and managing the department's shift towards emergency medical services.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears critical of affirmative action, at least as it has been implemented in the context of the Chicago Fire Department and city contracts. The text highlights a case where white individuals, connected to Mayor Daley's friends, fraudulently received affirmative action contracts meant for minority and female-owned businesses. This suggests the author believes that affirmative action can be manipulated for corrupt purposes and does not always benefit the intended groups.

The author also points out that Trotter, as a black man, intends to push affirmative action policies within a union that opposes racial preferences. This indicates that the author sees affirmative action as a contentious and divisive issue within the department. The overall tone suggests skepticism about the motives behind affirmative action policies, implying that they may be used for political cover rather than genuine efforts to promote diversity and equality."	0.026819999999999997	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical view of the misuse of affirmative action policies in the case of the Duffs suggests a concern with the integrity and implementation of these policies. The author is not directly criticizing the concept of affirmative action itself but is highlighting a specific instance where it was exploited. The sarcasm and cynicism towards the situation indicate a disapproval of the abuse of affirmative action rather than the policy. Therefore, the author's stance is somewhat against the misuse and improper implementation of affirmative action, not necessarily against the principle of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is a commentary on a case involving Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, who was the purchasing agent for Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley for 11 years. Grzyb was contacted to discuss his knowledge about the Duffs, Waste Management, and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall, as well as his opinion on how the Duffs received $100 million in affirmative action contracts. Grzyb, however, claimed to know nothing and refused to comment further. The author also mentions the lack of media interest in the story, attributing it to the absence of engaging visuals for television news. The Duffs, who are described as white men with connections to the ""Outfit"" (organized crime), allegedly misrepresented themselves as minorities to secure affirmative action contracts. The case is currently pending federal investigation, and both Grzyb and Mayor Daley declined to provide substantial comments. The author criticizes the situation and questions the integrity of affirmative action policies when they are exploited by those who are not the intended beneficiaries.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the misuse of affirmative action in the context of the Duffs' case. They highlight the irony and perceived injustice of white men with criminal ties exploiting affirmative action policies to secure lucrative contracts by falsely claiming minority status. The author's tone suggests a cynicism towards the implementation of affirmative action in this instance, as it seems to have been manipulated for personal gain rather than serving its intended purpose of helping disadvantaged minority groups. The rhetorical questions posed by the author at the end of the text reflect a sarcastic view of the situation, implying that the ideal of America as a land of opportunity is being perverted by such corrupt practices."	0.02984	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Clarence Page, does not directly express a clear stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The focus of the text is on celebrating the achievements of John H. Johnson and his philosophy of making oneself indispensable. While Page recounts Johnson's success without explicit reliance on affirmative action, the discussion does not explicitly endorse or criticize affirmative action policies. The narrative centers around individual merit and self-reliance, which could imply a preference for these values over affirmative action, but without a direct statement from Page on the policy itself, it is not possible to definitively categorize his stance.	"Summary:
The text is a tribute to John H. Johnson, a pioneering black publisher who passed away at the age of 87. Johnson was celebrated for his successful business philosophy encapsulated in his advice, ""Make yourself indispensable."" His publications, including Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, were vital to black Americans, providing a more positive representation of black America than mainstream media. Johnson's work also demonstrated the value of the black consumer market to advertisers and offered employment and a training ground for black journalists. His autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" is likened to a business-school case study, detailing how he overcame various challenges, such as launching Ebony, which sold out its initial press run, and Jet, which played a role in the civil rights movement. Despite criticisms of a sugar-coated emphasis on the black middle class, Johnson's contributions to media and business were significant. He was also a board member of Zenith Electronics, having secured them as a major advertiser for Ebony. The author, Clarence Page, highlights Johnson's problem-solving skills and his understanding that businesses must offer value, service, and quality to succeed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Clarence Page's perspective on affirmative action is subtly conveyed through the story of Matthew Henson and John H. Johnson's approach to business. Page recounts how Johnson used the example of Henson, who was not hired because of an affirmative action plan but because of his indispensable skills and knowledge, to illustrate the importance of making oneself indispensable in one's field. Johnson's own success story, as described by Page, reflects a similar philosophy; Johnson didn't rely on racial loyalty or affirmative action for his achievements but instead provided value, service, and quality that made his business indispensable to consumers and advertisers alike. Page seems to admire this self-reliant approach, suggesting that success comes from being essential and excellent in one's work rather than relying on externally imposed measures like affirmative action."	0.031110000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the text does not provide a personal perspective on affirmative action. They focus on the analysis of the debate and election dynamics, mentioning affirmative action only as one of the polarizing topics discussed. There is no indication of the author's personal stance on the matter, as the summary is centered on the candidates' performance and the implications for the election rather than the author's views on the specific issues.	"Summary:
The article analyzes the domestic policy debate during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, framing it as a contest between those who love President George W. Bush and those who hate him. The author suggests that while Bush's supporters are passionate, challenger John Kerry has not garnered a similar level of enthusiasm. However, Kerry was seen as the more skilled debater, with clearer presentations and a better command of the issues. The debate covered polarizing topics such as abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, and the role of government in healthcare and education, highlighting the stark differences between the candidates. Bush faced challenges in defending his record, particularly on the economy, while Kerry played to themes of class warfare. Both candidates attempted to use catchy lines, but these efforts were deemed unsuccessful. The article concludes with the observation that personal connection is important in presidential races and notes that incumbents who perform poorly in debates often lose elections.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly state their personal perspective on affirmative action. However, they mention that the topic was one of the controversial domestic issues discussed during the final debate between President Bush and Senator Kerry. The debate was described as outlining distinct differences between the two candidates on several issues, implying that affirmative action was one of the issues where the candidates had divergent views. The author's focus is on the overall analysis of the debate and the election dynamics, rather than providing a personal opinion on affirmative action or other individual policy issues."	0.030150000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author is critical of affirmative action, referencing it in the context of satirical events that mock what is perceived as political correctness in academia. Through the description of the 'Affirmative Action Bake Sale,' the author implies that affirmative action is a form of discrimination that could be seen as silly or unjust. The author's suggestion that outrage or policy changes in response to such events may reinforce over-sensitivity indicates a belief that affirmative action and its defense might be an overreaction. However, the author also values freedom of expression and appears to advocate for a measured response to criticism of affirmative action, as exemplified by the dignified response of the Rutgers team to Imus. This nuanced view suggests that the author is critical of affirmative action but does not support extreme measures against those who oppose it.	"Summary:
The text discusses the trend of satirical events at Columbia College Chicago and other universities intended to mock the perceived excesses of political correctness in academia. These events include an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale"" where prices vary based on race and a ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant"" game. The author acknowledges that while such events are not illegal, they can be hurtful, drawing a parallel to the controversial comments made by Don Imus towards the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The author suggests that instead of reacting with outrage or policy changes, which may reinforce a culture of over-sensitivity, such provocations might best be met with indifference, much like the Rutgers team's dignified response to Imus.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems critical of affirmative action, at least as it is represented and mocked by the proposed ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale."" The event is described as a way to highlight the ""purported silliness"" of discriminating based on race, even if such discrimination is meant to be favorable. This perspective suggests that the author views affirmative action as a form of discrimination that is counterproductive or unjust, aligning with the viewpoint that merit should be the sole criterion for decision-making, regardless of race or ethnicity. The author's tone indicates a belief that affirmative action is a form of ""wretched excess"" of political correctness that may be ripe for parody. However, the author also seems to respect the freedom of expression, implying that while they may not agree with the methods of affirmative action, they also do not support heavy-handed responses to those who criticize or mock it."	0.02562	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Charles Krauthammer, does not explicitly provide his personal stance on affirmative action within the summary provided. Instead, he mentions affirmative action as one of the topics that came up during the campaign season, highlighting Barack Obama's comments on the subject. Krauthammer's focus is on the benefits of a long campaign season for policy debate and consensus-building rather than on affirmative action itself. Therefore, it is not possible to categorize his stance on affirmative action based on the text summary provided.	"Summary:
Charles Krauthammer discusses the protracted nature of American presidential campaigns compared to the shorter election cycles in Britain, Canada, and other countries. He acknowledges that while the extended campaign season in the U.S. was not intentionally designed, it serves several important functions. First, it tests the organizational skills of candidates, which is crucial for managing the large federal government. Second, the primary season facilitates dialogue within political parties, helping to build consensus and democratic legitimacy that contribute to the nation's stability. Krauthammer suggests that the campaign process allows for significant debates and shifts in policy, as seen with Barack Obama's comments on affirmative action and Rudy Giuliani's stance on abortion. He also credits Bill Clinton's campaign for initiating welfare reform. Lastly, Krauthammer argues that the grueling campaign process satisfies American egalitarianism by humbling candidates before they can attain the powerful position of the presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Krauthammer presents affirmative action as a topic for potential debate within the Democratic Party, sparked by Barack Obama's suggestion to shift from race-based preferences to class-based preferences. He does not explicitly state his own views on affirmative action but implies that Obama's comments could lead to a significant discussion and possibly a new national consensus on the issue. The context suggests that Krauthammer sees the extended campaign season as a platform for substantial policy debates, including the future of affirmative action."	0.0259	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. They acknowledge that Lewis Hamilton's career benefited from 'a touch of affirmative action' but emphasize that his success is mainly attributed to his own talent and hard work. The author sees affirmative action as providing a fair opportunity in a costly sport, but not as the defining factor in Hamilton's achievements. The reference to affirmative action is minimal and is framed within the context of Hamilton's merit and the sport's expensive nature.	"Summary:
Lewis Hamilton, at age 22, has made an exceptional start to his Formula One career, achieving unprecedented success as a rookie. He has quickly become a historical figure in the sport, being compared to legends like Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. Hamilton's performance has been outstanding, securing third and second places in his first two races and showing the potential for a victory soon. His driving skills were particularly highlighted in the Malaysian Grand Prix, where he outmaneuvered competitors and played a strategic role in supporting his teammate, Fernando Alonso. Hamilton's progress in the sport has been supported by a developmental contract with McLaren at a young age, following his impressive accomplishments in junior racing series.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges that Lewis Hamilton's story includes ""but a touch of affirmative action""—just enough to be fair in the costly world of international formula racing. However, the author emphasizes that Hamilton has largely made his own success, leveraging the opportunity provided to him and demonstrating his exceptional talent and dedication. The author suggests that Hamilton's rise in Formula One is primarily due to his abilities and achievements rather than affirmative action policies. The assistance Hamilton received early in his career is portrayed as a fair chance in an expensive sport rather than a significant advantage. The author also notes the irony that Hamilton's opportunity at McLaren may have been facilitated by the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR, which was seen as a diversity coup for NASCAR but ultimately benefited Hamilton and Formula One."	0.02643	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's primary focus is on political hypocrisy and the perceived double standards in the media and among politicians, rather than on affirmative action. The single mention of affirmative action in the context of criticizing a politician's misuse of the policy for personal gain does not provide enough information to determine the author's overall stance on the principle of affirmative action itself. The reference is used to support a broader argument about political behavior, rather than to express a clear position for or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article criticizes President Barack Obama for a gaffe he made on ""The Tonight Show,"" where he compared his bowling skills to those of someone in the Special Olympics. The author suggests that if Obama were a Republican, he would face harsher consequences, but because he is a Democrat, the media will likely overlook the mistake. The author is more concerned with another issue: Obama's surprise over the $165 million in bonuses for AIG executives, which were known by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner weeks prior. The author compares Washington's political tactics to those of Chicago's City Hall, implying corruption and self-serving behavior among politicians. The text also portrays House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as hypocritical for her stance on the AIG bonuses while enjoying the perks of her position. The author believes the outrage from Democrats is a façade to cover their own involvement in the AIG bonus issue and to maintain their political image against the ""Evil Rich Guy"" stereotype.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly address affirmative action in the text. However, they make a passing reference to Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, who gave $100 million in affirmative action contracts to white men he knew well, rather than the intended black female beneficiaries. This anecdote is used to illustrate the theme of political hypocrisy and deception, suggesting that politicians like Daley publicly support affirmative action but may not genuinely implement it as intended. The author's mention of this incident in the context of criticizing political behavior could imply a critical view of how affirmative action is sometimes executed by politicians, but it does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the author's overall stance on affirmative action itself."	0.029490000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Melissa Harris, appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action. Her writing acknowledges the importance and success of the IMPACT program in increasing diversity on nonprofit boards and recognizes the challenges that minorities face in these areas. She discusses the complexities and potential pitfalls of affirmative action, such as tokenism and the need for genuine inclusion. While she seems to appreciate the outcomes of affirmative action initiatives, her wish for diversity to be achieved without such programs indicates a nuanced perspective that favors affirmative action but also looks forward to a time when it may no longer be necessary.	"Summary:
Phyllis Lockett, a well-credentialed African-American woman with an impressive background in business and nonprofit work, was targeted by executive recruiter Charles Tribbett III for a board position at a large Chicago cultural institution. This was part of a broader initiative, called IMPACT, aimed at diversifying the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits by including more qualified minorities. The initiative, funded by various foundations and companies, spent around $400,000 to place nine minorities on these boards over three years. Despite challenges such as a small pool of minority candidates with the necessary job titles and wealth, the reluctance of some institutions to participate, and the economic downturn, the program saw some success. The author notes the difficulties minorities face in meeting giving requirements and the potential for an unspoken higher standard. The article also highlights the need for a new generation of minority leaders as the current ones are overextended.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Melissa Harris, seems to support the idea of affirmative action, as evidenced by her acknowledgment of the necessity of programs like IMPACT to increase diversity on nonprofit boards. She recognizes the challenges in achieving diversity, such as the small pool of minority candidates and the potential for tokenism. Harris appears to understand the complexities of affirmative action, including the need for genuine inclusion and the avoidance of merely symbolic gestures. However, she also expresses a wish that diversity could be achieved without the need for special programs, suggesting a desire for a more organically diverse and inclusive society."	0.0275	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action but instead focuses on the misuse of Martin Luther King Jr.'s words in the context of affirmative action debates. Hutchinson emphasizes the complexity of King's ideas and warns against the 'dangerous ideological revisionism' that oversimplifies King's stance for contemporary political purposes. The text suggests that King's broader vision for social change, which encompasses economic and educational opportunities, is more relevant than a narrow focus on affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly articulated, and the focus is on the misinterpretation of historical figures' views on the matter.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizing the complexity of his ideas and the difficulty in applying them to contemporary issues. It criticizes the misuse of King's words in debates like those over affirmative action during California's Proposition 209. The author, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, acknowledges the paradoxes in King's positions and personal life, but also highlights his practical solutions to societal problems, including the black family crisis, educational neglect, political apathy, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare. Despite the mixed success of King's proposals, Hutchinson argues that King's vision and efforts remain more substantial than many contemporary leaders' approaches.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author suggests caution when interpreting Martin Luther King Jr.'s stance on affirmative action, as King's comments on the subject were limited and the concept was still in its infancy during the 1960s. Hutchinson criticizes the ""dangerous ideological revisionism"" seen in the Proposition 209 debate, where both sides manipulated King's words to support their arguments. The text implies that King's ideas on affirmative action and related social justice issues cannot be neatly categorized or co-opted by modern political agendas. Instead, King's broader agenda for social change, which included aspects related to economic and educational opportunities, should be considered in its entirety rather than through isolated comments on affirmative action."	0.02842	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text and is mentioned in passing as part of a historical pattern of political scapegoating in California. The inclusion of affirmative action in a list of issues used to create division in politics suggests that the author may view it as a politicized topic. However, the author does not provide a clear stance for or against affirmative action, instead expressing a general cynicism towards the cyclical nature of political issues. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined conclusively from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text captures the essence of California as a place of perpetual change yet paradoxically steeped in recurring themes and issues. It portrays California as a land of natural volatility, with a history of dealing with water scarcity, except during floods. Politically, the state has a pattern of targeting various groups as the 'Other' throughout its history, from Chinese laborers to affirmative action beneficiaries. The author reflects on the monotony that journalists face when reporting on recurring stories and expresses a degree of cynicism towards the news cycle. Looking to the future, the author humorously predicts that Californians will continue to grapple with the same old issues: water wars, political divisiveness, and cultural icons. The text ends by highlighting the ongoing debates in the state legislature, particularly concerning gambling regulations, and the cyclical nature of political issues fueled by financial contributions to lawmakers.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is presented within a broader context of California's history of political campaigns against various marginalized groups. The author lists beneficiaries of affirmative action alongside groups that have historically been discriminated against or used as scapegoats in California politics. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as one of many issues that have been politicized and used to create division. The tone of the text does not explicitly endorse or criticize affirmative action; rather, it is mentioned as part of a pattern in which political figures target different groups over time. Given the overall cynical tone of the text regarding the repetitive nature of political issues, the author may imply that affirmative action, like other issues, is subjected to ongoing debate without reaching a resolution that satisfies all parties."	0.02876	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed in the summary provided. Affirmative action is mentioned only in passing as one of the issues that conservatives have historically used to explain American anxiety. The author's main focus appears to be on the shift in American sentiment towards optimism and the political implications of this shift. Since the author's personal stance on affirmative action is not stated or clearly implied, it is not possible to categorize the author's view on affirmative action based on the summary provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses a shift in American sentiment towards optimism after a period of pessimism about the country's future. This change is attributed to positive economic indicators, such as growth, low unemployment, and a shrinking federal budget deficit, as well as cultural and technological advancements emanating from places like Seattle, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley. The author notes that this renewed optimism has political implications, as it challenges the narratives of both conservatives and liberals who have previously attributed American anxiety to various societal issues. Politicians may need to adapt to this optimistic climate, which favors incremental change and cooperation over ideological confrontation. However, the author warns against complacency, emphasizing that despite the good times, America still faces significant challenges, such as education, wage stagnation, and urban decay. The text suggests that prosperity should be used to invest in long-term growth and to extend opportunities more broadly, drawing a parallel to the post-World War II era when the U.S. made significant infrastructure and social investments.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but it is included in a list of issues that conservatives have blamed for American anxiety. Conservatives are described as pointing fingers at ""big government, welfare, affirmative action, immigrants, and the forces of cultural change"" as sources of national concern. While the author does not provide a personal stance on affirmative action, they indicate that in the current climate of optimism, the issues that have traditionally been seen as divisive or problematic, such as affirmative action, may be losing their negative connotations. This suggests that the author sees affirmative action as one of the issues that might be viewed differently in a more optimistic and less hostile environment. However, without further context or explicit commentary, the author's personal view on the policy itself remains unclear."	0.03226	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author is depicted as supportive of affirmative action, as evidenced by their endorsement of increased funding for civil rights enforcement and their critical view of affirmative action opponents. The author underscores the importance of strict enforcement of civil rights laws to combat racial inequality and discrimination, referencing Justice Ginsburg's comments on persistent racial barriers. The support for President Clinton's initiative to engage in a debate on race and the emphasis on action over dialogue further indicate the author's favorable stance towards affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights enforcement funding by 17%, from $516 million to $602 million, to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. The author highlights the persistence of racial barriers in the workplace, housing, and other areas, as described by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The proposal aims to address the overworked and underfunded Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by increasing its funding to reduce case backlogs and promote mediation. Additionally, the Justice Department's civil rights division would receive an 11% funding increase, and the Housing and Urban Development Department would get $22 million more to hire ""testers"" to uncover housing discrimination. The author questions the political opposition to the proposal, especially from those against affirmative action who claim to support equal opportunity. President Clinton's initiative is part of a broader effort to engage the nation in a debate on race, with the author emphasizing that strict enforcement of civil rights laws is crucial.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be supportive of affirmative action and critical of its opponents. The author argues that despite the existence of laws that should guarantee equal opportunities, these laws are ineffective without strict enforcement. The author also references Justice Ginsburg's eloquent description of ongoing racial inequality and discrimination to reinforce the need for affirmative action measures. The author seems perplexed by the opposition to the Clinton administration's proposal to increase civil rights enforcement, especially from those who oppose affirmative action but claim to support equal opportunity. This suggests that the author believes in the necessity of affirmative action as a means to combat persistent racial barriers and to ensure fair treatment in various aspects of life. The author advocates for action over dialogue, indicating a belief that affirmative action policies, along with strict enforcement of civil rights laws, are essential for achieving true equality."	0.024939999999999997	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's text does not provide a clear indication of their stance on affirmative action. The mention of affirmative action is only in relation to Mayor Richard Riordan's political positions and potential challenges within the Republican Party, not as a subject of direct commentary or analysis by the author. There is no explicit expression of support or opposition to affirmative action, and the author's perspective on the policy is not the focus of the discussion.	"Summary:
The text discusses the importance of having a ""fire in the belly"" in both sports and politics, referring to an intense drive and determination to succeed. The author reflects on this quality in the context of the California gubernatorial race, where three potential candidates decided not to run, leaving four others in the contest. The author briefly evaluates the reasons why Senator Dianne Feinstein, Leon Panetta, and Mayor Richard Riordan chose not to enter the race, despite having the potential to be good governors. The discussion then shifts to the remaining candidates: Republican Dan Lungren and Democrats Gray Davis, Al Checchi, and Jane Harman. The author suggests that while none of them may be the best governors imaginable, they all have the necessary determination and eagerness to pursue the office.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal opinion on affirmative action but does mention it in the context of Mayor Richard Riordan's political positions. The author notes that Riordan did not support the anti-affirmative action initiatives, which could have made him a target for criticism from fellow Republicans during a primary contest. This reference suggests that affirmative action was a contentious issue within the Republican Party, and Riordan's stance may have been at odds with the more conservative elements of the party. However, since the author does not elaborate on this point, it's unclear whether the author views affirmative action positively or negatively. The focus is more on how Riordan's position might have affected his political viability within his party rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action policies themselves."	0.027950000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Herschel Rosenthal, does not explicitly state his position on affirmative action in the provided summary. He focuses on the decline of personal relationships among legislators and how this has negatively impacted the debate on sensitive issues, including affirmative action. Rosenthal's concern is more about the quality of discourse and the lack of sensitivity in handling such issues, rather than affirmative action itself. His perspective suggests that he believes affirmative action is a topic that requires a more thoughtful and understanding approach, which is currently lacking. However, without a clear statement of support or opposition to affirmative action itself, it is not possible to accurately categorize his stance on the policy.	"Summary:
Herschel Rosenthal, a former state legislator, reflects on the changes he has witnessed during his 24 years in the California State Capitol. He notes the positive developments, such as increased public involvement in state policy and better representation of California's diversity within the legislature. However, he expresses concern over the deterioration of personal relationships among legislators, which has made the job less enjoyable and hindered the ability to reach consensus on public policy. Rosenthal attributes this decline to several factors, including crass public discourse, term limits, and political competition. He highlights the negative impact this has had on debates around sensitive issues such as affirmative action, bilingual education, and illegal immigration, where a lack of sensitivity and understanding was evident. Rosenthal stresses the importance of legislators getting to know each other personally to foster harmony and effectively tackle the state's complex issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Herschel Rosenthal, views affirmative action and related issues (bilingual education and illegal immigration) as subjects of ""disturbing racial undertones"" in recent ballot measures. He is disheartened by the debates surrounding these measures, which he believes were conducted with ""an utter lack of sensitivity or understanding."" This implies that Rosenthal perceives affirmative action as a contentious and sensitive topic that has been handled poorly by legislators, partly due to the decline in personal relationships and the inability to engage in respectful and empathetic dialogue. His perspective suggests that he values affirmative action and is concerned about the divisive and insensitive manner in which it has been addressed in the legislative arena."	0.02603	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Jose Novoa, is critical of the narrow focus on race in affirmative action policies and argues for a more comprehensive approach that includes class issues. While he acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action in helping to create a new generation of middle-class professionals of color, he also points out its limitations for those in the working and poverty classes. Novoa's perspective suggests that he sees affirmative action as necessary but incomplete, advocating for additional measures to address systemic racism and economic disparities. His stance indicates that he is in favor of affirmative action but believes it should be part of a broader strategy that also tackles class inequality.	"Summary:
Jose Novoa, a PhD student in ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, critiques President Bill Clinton's race-dialogue initiative for its narrow focus on race, arguing that it should also address class issues. Novoa acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action in creating a new generation of middle-class professionals of color but points out its limitations for the working and poverty classes. He recounts the historical shift from civil rights to ""black power"" and how corporate interests redefined it as black capitalism, which failed to address racism effectively. Novoa suggests that critics of affirmative action who propose class-based policies may not be genuinely interested in helping poor people of color. He urges Clinton's advisory panel to recognize the economic diversity within communities of color and adopt a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism, including addressing educational funding disparities, legal reforms, and structural economic changes.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author acknowledges the successes of affirmative action in helping people of color enter the middle class and professional fields. However, he also critiques affirmative action for not sufficiently addressing the economic challenges faced by poor people of color. Novoa sees affirmative action as necessary but not as a standalone solution, and he criticizes it for being tokenistic and potentially pacifying rather than transformative in addressing systemic racism.

Novoa argues that affirmative action has been co-opted and diverted from its original focus on helping the poor, instead becoming a tool for maintaining the status quo. He suggests that a class analysis should be combined with an anti-racist one to truly understand and tackle the needs of poor people of color. The author also questions the sincerity of conservative critics who advocate for class-based affirmative action, suspecting that they may be using it as a pretext to undermine race-based policies.

Overall, Novoa advocates for a broader, more comprehensive approach that addresses the different experiences of racism across economic classes and calls for a variety of strategies to combat racism, including legal reforms, educational funding equity, and structural economic changes."	0.03601	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated. The text provides an account of Rod Pacheco's political position, including his opposition to affirmative action, without the author expressing a personal stance. The author's focus is on the political developments within the Latino community and the Republican party's strategy to gain Latino support, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the rise of Latino political influence in California, with Cruz Bustamante being the first Latino Assembly speaker and later the first Latino lieutenant governor in over a century. Antonio Villaraigosa, another prominent Latino figure, succeeded Bustamante as speaker and considered running for L.A. mayor. The focus then shifts to Rod Pacheco, a Republican Latino who was elected as the new leader of the Assembly Republicans, the first Latino to do so. His election and the increase of GOP Latino lawmakers are seen as positive developments for the Republican Party, especially after a challenging election. Pacheco is described as a centrist, former prosecutor, and a fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who opposes affirmative action but supports abortion rights. The article mentions his potential for statewide candidacy but notes his own hesitancy about such speculation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents Pacheco's stance on affirmative action through the lens of his support for Proposition 209, which aimed to end state racial preferences. This indicates that Pacheco, and by extension the author's portrayal of the Republican perspective, views affirmative action policies as negative and supports their elimination. The author does not explicitly provide a personal opinion on affirmative action but uses Pacheco's position to highlight a broader Republican viewpoint that is against such policies. The mention of the GOP's need to move past the negative associations with former Governor Pete Wilson's anti-affirmative action stance suggests that the author recognizes the party's struggle with the legacy of divisive politics and the need for a more inclusive approach to gain Latino support."	0.02799	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt	4
	None	The author of the text does not provide a clear stance on affirmative action. The text primarily discusses the political climate in California and the shift in voter priorities from education to potentially health care and infrastructure. Affirmative action is mentioned in the context of its urgency diminishing after the passage of Proposition 209, but the author does not offer a personal viewpoint or analysis on the policy itself. Therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political landscape in California, highlighting the importance of education as a key issue for politicians, including Governor Gray Davis and his predecessor Pete Wilson. However, pollster Steve Kinney suggests that education as a top voter concern may be waning, with health care and infrastructure set to become more prominent issues by the 2002 election. This shift in voter priorities could be influenced by an ongoing strong economy or a shift to concerns about taxes, crime, and jobs if the economy falters. Kinney notes that issues like illegal immigration and affirmative action lost their urgency after the passage of Propositions 187 and 209, respectively. Kinney's unique polling method focuses on the intensity of concern for an issue by counting only the responses with the highest level of personal importance. While education is still a top issue, Kinney predicts it will drop in priority. Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, agrees with the trend but not the immediacy, expecting education to remain significant for a longer period. The text also mentions the initiatives by Democratic leaders Antonio Villaraigosa and John Burton to address health care and transportation, respectively, suggesting that Governor Davis should also take a leading role in these emerging issues.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author does mention that affirmative action was a ""hot issue"" that cooled down after the passage of Proposition 209. This suggests that affirmative action was a contentious and high-profile topic in California politics, which became less of a public concern after legislative action was taken to address it. The author's focus is more on the changing priorities of California voters and the political response to those changes rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself."	0.02943	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not provide a direct opinion on affirmative action but instead reports on Jim Brulte's actions and strategies regarding diversity within the Republican Party. Brulte is described as avoiding divisive issues like affirmative action, but he actively supports women and minority candidates, suggesting a practical approach to diversity. Since the author's perspective is not explicitly stated, and the focus is on Brulte's pragmatic political actions rather than on affirmative action as a policy, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the challenges faced by the California Republican Party, highlighting the dearth of strong candidates and the lack of Republicans in top state positions. It focuses on Jim Brulte, the state Senate minority leader, who is praised for his political acumen and respect across party lines. Brulte's political history includes working for Vice President George Bush and being an influential figure in the California Assembly and Senate. Despite the GOP's disadvantages, Brulte is described as a pragmatist who prioritizes political strategy and legislative compromise over ideological battles. He avoids divisive issues like abortion and gun control, instead focusing on unifying topics such as school accountability and transportation. Brulte also invests in diversifying the Republican Party by supporting women and minority candidates. The party's financial health has improved under Brulte's tenure as finance chairman, and he is seen as a key figure for George W. Bush's fundraising efforts in California. Despite the Republican Party's struggles, Brulte remains optimistic about its future.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not directly express a personal perspective on affirmative action but does report Brulte's actions regarding the issue. Brulte is said to avoid getting involved in ""errant, divisive issues"" such as affirmative action. However, he has his own approach to affirmative action within the party context, having contributed significant funds to support the primary campaigns of Republican women and minority candidates. This suggests that Brulte recognizes the importance of diversity within the party and is actively working to promote it. His actions imply a practical approach to affirmative action, aimed at broadening the appeal and inclusiveness of the Republican Party without engaging in the broader political and ideological debates surrounding the policy."	0.029339999999999998	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical mention of Governor Davis's efforts to reinstate a form of affirmative action at the University of California, alongside other actions that are considered a departure from his centrist image, suggests a negative view of affirmative action. The author sees affirmative action as part of a liberal agenda, implying that it is not aligned with a centrist or business-friendly approach. Additionally, the author's connection to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally has conservative leanings, reinforces the likelihood of a stance that is not supportive of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The article discusses California Governor Gray Davis's decision to sign legislation requiring overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, making California one of only two states to have such a law. This move is seen as a departure from Davis's centrist image, revealing a leftward shift influenced by the liberal California Legislature and interest groups that supported his campaign. The new law is contrasted with the more common 40-hour week overtime rule, and concerns are raised about its impact on the flexibility of California workers and businesses, as well as the state's business climate. The author questions whether Davis's actions align with his centrist mantra, noting his appointments from union, environmental, and trial lawyer ranks, and his efforts to reinstate a form of affirmative action at the University of California. The piece concludes by recognizing that while Davis is not an extreme liberal, his administration is influenced by groups favoring regulatory expansion.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of affirmative action, at least in the context of Governor Davis's policies. The mention of Davis ""orchestrating the reinstitution of a form of affirmative action at the University of California"" is listed among other actions that supposedly betray his centrist image and align him with his liberal supporters. The author's tone suggests a view that affirmative action is part of a liberal agenda that Governor Davis should be wary of endorsing if he wishes to maintain a centrist stance. Additionally, the author's affiliation with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an organization that typically advocates for business interests, may reflect a perspective that is more conservative and less supportive of affirmative action policies."	0.027110000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's initial emotional reaction indicates a strong support for affirmative action, but as they reflect on their son's situation and the evolution of the policy, their stance becomes more nuanced. They seem to advocate for a more selective and updated approach to affirmative action, focusing on those who face genuine social disadvantages rather than a blanket policy based solely on race. The author's support for equal opportunity based on hard work and overcoming adversity suggests they still value the principles behind affirmative action but recognize the need for its reform to adapt to current realities.	"Summary:
The text is a personal reflection by a parent on their son Miguel's high school essay about affirmative action. Initially, the parent is infuriated by Miguel's stance that affirmative action should be abolished, despite it being a program that would benefit him as a Latino student in a predominantly Caucasian school. The parent, who had fought for affirmative action in their youth, feels a sense of betrayal and is ready to argue against Miguel's view. However, upon reflection, the parent acknowledges that Miguel has the advantages needed to succeed without affirmative action. The essay then explores the broader context of the program, considering the less privileged students who still face significant barriers. The parent discusses changes in affirmative action policies, such as the University of California's approach to broaden eligibility and provide support for underrepresented students. After a conversation with Miguel, the son's final draft of the essay advocates for equal opportunity for all who work hard, reflecting a nuanced understanding of the issue.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author initially has a strong emotional connection to affirmative action, having advocated for it in their youth and seeing it as a means to combat racial inequality in education. They are proud of the program's historical role in creating opportunities for minorities and challenging institutional privilege. However, the author's perspective becomes more complex as they consider their son's privileged background, which includes educated parents and a well-resourced school. This leads the author to question whether affirmative action should be applied universally or targeted towards those who face actual social disadvantages.

The author recognizes that affirmative action has been a valuable tool but also sees the potential for it to be updated to reflect current realities. They acknowledge that there are still stark disparities in educational opportunities and suggest that policies should be more selective, focusing on students who genuinely need assistance. The author seems to support the idea that affirmative action should not be based solely on race, but rather on the actual circumstances and adversities faced by individuals. They agree with the notion that success in the face of adversity should be recognized and rewarded, which aligns with a more nuanced and reality-based approach to affirmative action. Ultimately, the author supports the idea of providing equal opportunities to all who strive for success, which seems to be a synthesis of their initial belief in the importance of affirmative action and their recognition of its complexities in practice."	0.03351	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's critique of the SAT and other standardized tests, along with the concern for underrepresentation of minorities and the desire for a more equitable admissions process, indicates a stance that is in favor of affirmative action. The author's focus on rectifying racial, economic, and class inequalities in education suggests support for policies that would help level the playing field, which is the goal of affirmative action. The author's reference to the debate at Pitzer College and the mention of Ward Connerly's opposition to affirmative action further imply that the author is aligned with viewpoints that advocate for affirmative action as a means to combat systemic biases.	"Summary:
The text is a critical examination of the use of the SAT as a measure of merit for college admissions. The author argues that the SAT is not an accurate reflection of a student's potential for success and instead perpetuates racial, economic, and class inequalities. The test is seen to favor those with certain racial and economic privileges, particularly rich white students, and does not account for the varying quality of educational opportunities available to different demographics. The author also critiques the use of other standardized tests like the SAT II, MCAT, LSAT, and GRE, as well as the reliance on grade-point averages, which can be inflated by advanced placement courses not available to all students. The underrepresentation of minorities in graduate programs is highlighted as a significant issue. The author suggests that admissions criteria should focus on qualities like critical thinking and intercultural awareness rather than biased measures. The text also touches on the financial burden of test preparation and the large testing industry. The author concludes by advocating for the creation of more university seats instead of spending money on exclusionary practices and mentions the ongoing debate about the SAT at Pitzer College.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of the current standardized testing system and its role in college admissions, viewing it as a form of maintaining racial and economic advantages for certain groups. This perspective suggests a support for affirmative action policies, as the author is concerned with the underrepresentation of minorities and the inherent biases in admissions criteria that disadvantage these groups. The author argues for a more equitable admissions process that allows for the manifestation of students' drive and determination and emphasizes critical thinking and intercultural awareness over standardized test scores. The mention of Ward Connerly's opposition to affirmative action and the implication that the SAT serves as a proxy for racial and economic preference indicates that the author likely disagrees with Connerly's stance and supports efforts to address and rectify the inequalities present in higher education admissions."	0.030600000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author appreciates the historical significance of affirmative action and acknowledges the positive impact it had on increasing opportunities for minorities and women. By specifically mentioning the Philadelphia Plan, an affirmative action effort, in a positive light, the author indicates support for such measures. Additionally, the author's background as a former black Republican who has become a Democrat suggests a possible alignment with more progressive views on social policies, including affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author reflects on the challenges and contradictions of being a black Republican, drawing from personal and familial experiences. The author grew up in a black Republican family, with a father who was a delegate at the 1964 GOP convention and an advocate for self-reliance over government dependency. Despite facing hostility, such as being run off the road by John Birch Society members, the author's father remained loyal to the Republican Party. The author acknowledges the historical contributions of African American Republicans like Art Fletcher, who worked on affirmative action efforts like the Philadelphia Plan. However, the author also observes that the motivations of contemporary black Republicans can be complex, ranging from a desire to unsettle others to strategic political ambitions. The author, once a black Republican themselves, ultimately left the party and became a Democrat, feeling disconnected from the current state of the Republican Party and developing different political values.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action positively, recognizing it as a legacy of past African American Republicans who demonstrated commitment to the black community. The author specifically mentions the Philadelphia Plan, implemented during Richard Nixon's presidency, as a pioneering effort in affirmative action that increased opportunities for minorities and women in the job market. The author's reference to this plan suggests a belief in the importance of such measures to promote equality and fairness in society."	0.0233	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Felicia Clark, expresses concerns that the new multiethnic categories in the 2000 census may undermine the effectiveness of affirmative action. She believes that these categories could dilute the political power of ethnic communities and serve conservative interests by complicating the implementation of reparations for historically oppressed groups. Clark's criticism of these new classifications indicates that she values the role of clear racial data in supporting affirmative action and similar race-based programs. Her stance reflects a commitment to the principles of affirmative action, as she advocates for the continued use of traditional race categories until the need for new classifications is justified. Thus, her perspective is critical of any changes that could potentially weaken the impact of affirmative action.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark, an educator with the Compton Unified School District, criticizes the 2000 census for introducing 57 multiethnic categories, arguing that it complicates the monitoring and implementation of affirmative action and other race-based programs. Clark suggests that the new categories dilute the political power of ethnic communities and serve conservative interests by undermining reparations for historically oppressed groups. She also questions the logic behind the categorization of multiethnic individuals, particularly those with mixed heritage involving white ancestry, and the practical implications for individuals identifying with Native American ancestry. Clark proposes that socio-economic factors might be a more relevant focus for data collection than race, and encourages ethnic groups to continue using traditional race categories until the government clarifies the need for the new multiethnic classifications.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of the way the new census categories affect affirmative action. She sees the new multiethnic classifications as a tool that hinders the effectiveness of affirmative action by making it more difficult to define and support racial groups that have historically faced discrimination. Clark implies that affirmative action and similar programs require clear racial data to function properly, and that the new categories introduced by the census obscure this data, potentially weakening the political influence of minority groups and complicating the distribution of resources meant to address past injustices. Furthermore, she suggests that the new categorizations may be a deliberate attempt to prevent the advancement of racially-based reparations and social justice initiatives. Clark's perspective is that maintaining traditional racial categories is essential until there is a clear and justifiable reason for the change, as it ensures that affirmative action and related programs can continue to address racial disparities effectively."	0.02514	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	4
0	strongly_against	The author's critique of the University of California Board of Regents' new admissions policies indicates a strong opposition to the use of non-academic criteria in college admissions, which the author views as a form of affirmative action. The concern over the loss of objectivity and fairness, the criticism of moving away from standardized testing, and the fear of hidden agendas and politicization all suggest that the author is against the principles of affirmative action as they believe it compromises academic standards and meritocracy.	"Summary:
The University of California Board of Regents has introduced new admissions policies that consider factors beyond academic qualifications, such as athletic or artistic talent and overcoming poverty. Although the policies claim not to promote race-based admissions, the author argues that the true intention is to remove fairness and objectivity from the admissions process. The author criticizes the move away from standardized testing like the SAT, which is deemed objective and a reliable predictor of academic success. The author suggests that subjective criteria in admissions will allow for hidden agendas and politicization, potentially disadvantaging academically qualified students. The author also points out that athletes have always had preferential treatment in admissions and questions how overcoming poverty is relevant to college qualification. The new guidelines are seen as a move towards egalitarianism, undermining the concept of academic competence, which the author believes will harm both students and universities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Edwin A. Locke, is critical of affirmative action and believes that it undermines the principles of fairness and objectivity in college admissions. He views the move away from standardized testing and academic qualifications as a way to reintroduce race and other subjective factors into the admissions process, despite official statements to the contrary. Locke suggests that the new admissions criteria are a covert means to achieve egalitarian outcomes rather than merit-based ones. He is concerned that this approach will lead to the admission of less academically qualified students and will harm both the integrity of the university system and the prospects of students who have worked hard and performed well academically. Locke's perspective is rooted in a belief in individual merit and the importance of maintaining high academic standards in higher education admissions."	0.02573	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly mentioned in the summary provided. The discussion focuses on Chief Justice Rehnquist's judicial philosophy and decisions rather than affirmative action specifically. However, the author's critical view of Rehnquist's conservative shifts and skepticism about protecting private behavior through law, as well as the mention of Rehnquist's efforts to limit civil rights expansions, suggest that the author may not align with Rehnquist's views. Despite this, without clear evidence of the author's stance on affirmative action, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's perspective on the issue.	"Summary:
The text discusses the role and influence of various Chief Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on the legacy of William H. Rehnquist. John Marshall established judicial review, while Earl Warren expanded constitutional principles to address racial segregation and defendants' rights. Rehnquist, who joined the Supreme Court in 1972 and served as Chief Justice for the last 19 years of his tenure, aimed to shift the court's direction. His record is mixed, with successful efforts to limit civil rights expansions, but he failed to overturn the core of Roe vs. Wade or the ban on school prayer. Rehnquist's perspective favored states' rights, a narrow view of federal power, and skepticism about protecting private behavior through law. His most controversial decision was in Bush vs. Gore, which the author criticizes as ""activist"" and poorly reasoned. Rehnquist's health issues and potential retirement have sparked discussions about his successor and the future direction of the Supreme Court.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated, but it can be inferred from the broader context of Rehnquist's views and the author's critique of his judicial philosophy. The author notes that Rehnquist's opinions were often narrowly focused on the facts at hand, leading to uncertainty about how the court would rule on affirmative action programs. This suggests a lack of clear guiding principles from Rehnquist on the issue. Additionally, the author's critical tone toward Rehnquist's conservative shifts, especially in civil rights matters, implies that the author may view affirmative action as part of the broader civil rights agenda that Rehnquist sought to constrain. The author's disapproval of Rehnquist's ""activist"" decision in Bush vs. Gore further suggests a belief that Rehnquist's court was inconsistent in its application of equal protection principles, which could extend to skepticism about his stance on affirmative action."	0.032600000000000004	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author, David Gelernter, is characterized as somewhat against affirmative action based on the text summary. He is critical of Democrats for being resistant to change and suggests that affirmative action, as a policy, may no longer be necessary. Gelernter questions the continued need for affirmative action after three decades and implies that it is part of an outdated approach to addressing societal issues. While he does not outright reject the concept of affirmative action, his call for reassessment and potential move beyond such policies indicates a stance that is not fully supportive.	"Summary:
In the text provided, Yale professor David Gelernter criticizes Senator Charles Schumer's assertion that Republicans want to turn back the clock to earlier, less progressive times. Gelernter argues that Democrats, not Republicans, are the reactionary party clinging to the status quo. He accuses Democrats of obstructing progress, such as the confirmation of judges, and being resistant to change in areas like education, the United Nations, Social Security, and abortion policy. Gelernter suggests that Republicans are the true progressives, advocating for justice, democracy, and reform. He also touches on the topics of racism, sexism, classism, and affirmative action, implying that Democrats rely on outdated explanations for societal issues and are unwilling to reevaluate the continued need for programs like affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, appears to be critical of affirmative action, questioning whether it is still necessary after 30 years of implementation. He suggests that the policy may no longer be the appropriate tool to address racism, sexism, and classism, and he challenges the assumption that these factors explain all negative societal outcomes. Gelernter's perspective seems to suggest that affirmative action is part of the Democrats' reluctance to move on from past approaches to social justice, indicating that he believes it is time to reassess and possibly move beyond such policies."	0.02497	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author of the text criticizes affirmative action, particularly in its application to Clarence Thomas, and highlights the negative aspects of the policy, such as the devaluation of achievements and the perpetuation of stereotypes. The author's use of Thomas's personal opposition to affirmative action and the argument against the hypocrisy of its proponents suggests a stance that is critical of the policy. The emphasis on individual merit and the negative consequences of affirmative action on beneficiaries' self-perception indicate a perspective that is against the policy.	"Summary:
The text discusses the criticism Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced, particularly the claim that he is an ""affirmative action hire."" The author references liberal commentators like Eugene Robinson and Anna Quindlen, who have suggested that Thomas's appointment was based on his race rather than his qualifications. The author argues that this view is hypocritical, as it undermines the very principles of affirmative action that these critics usually support. The text also highlights Thomas's personal opposition to affirmative action, as detailed in his memoir ""My Grandfather's Son,"" and his belief that it devalues the achievements of black professionals. The author, James Kirchick, criticizes the treatment of Thomas by his opponents and calls for him to be treated as an individual rather than a political symbol.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of affirmative action, particularly in the way it has been applied to Clarence Thomas. They argue that affirmative action can lead to the devaluation of genuine achievements by black professionals due to the perception that they are only in their positions because of their race. The author also points out the hypocrisy of liberal critics who support affirmative action but then use it to discredit Thomas. By highlighting Thomas's personal experiences and views on affirmative action, the author suggests that such policies can cause personal insecurity and shame among its beneficiaries. The author advocates for individual merit and criticizes the use of immutable traits as factors in selection processes, indicating a belief that affirmative action can be demeaning and rob individuals of their individuality. Overall, the author's perspective is that affirmative action, as it is currently practiced, is flawed and has negative consequences for both its intended beneficiaries and society's perceptions of merit and achievement."	0.02923	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author presents a summary of different perspectives on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings without explicitly stating their own position on affirmative action. The mention of Kimberly West-Faulcon's observations regarding Republicans' concerns about affirmative action and identity politics indicates that the author is aware of the political dynamics surrounding the issue. However, the author does not provide a personal opinion or analysis that would clearly align them with any particular stance on affirmative action. Instead, the author focuses on reporting the perspectives of others during the hearings.	"Summary:
During the four-day Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination, Republicans emphasized the importance of national security, fiscal responsibility, gun rights, and warned against judicial activism. Sotomayor maintained a moderate profile and presented herself as open-minded. Legal experts provided their perspectives on the hearings:

Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, believed the hearings allowed senators to address their constituents and introduced Sotomayor to the public without revealing how she would act as a justice. He noted her conservative-leaning statements and her portrayal of the Constitution as static.

Ilya Shapiro from the Cato Institute criticized Sotomayor for being evasive and found her less favorable after the hearings due to her non-committal answers.

Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, observed the hearings as an opportunity for Republicans to express their concerns about affirmative action and identity politics. She praised Sotomayor for appearing moderate and judicious.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, through the voice of Kimberly West-Faulcon, suggests that the Republican senators used the hearings to emphasize their stance on affirmative action, framing it as a wedge issue. West-Faulcon implies that the Republicans were appealing to the fears of white Americans regarding minorities in authority positions. She also alludes to the Ricci case, where white firefighters claimed discrimination, to illustrate the Republicans' focus on affirmative action during the hearings. West-Faulcon's perspective indicates that the discussion around affirmative action was less about vetting Sotomayor and more about the senators promoting their own ideologies. She also suggests that Sotomayor successfully presented herself as a moderate judge, which was likely her goal in the context of the discussions around affirmative action and other issues."	0.02705	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author acknowledges the benefits of affirmative action for some within the black community but criticizes it for not reaching the most disadvantaged individuals. They argue that affirmative action has inadvertently widened the class gap within the black community and has not addressed the systemic issues at the root of racial inequality. The author suggests that more comprehensive solutions are necessary, indicating a belief that affirmative action is insufficient on its own. The perspective is critical of the scope and impact of affirmative action but does not reject its premise entirely, suggesting a stance that is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the Miami riot and the broader issue of race riots, arguing that they result from more than just racial discrimination. The author acknowledges discrimination, particularly by the Miami police, as a factor but emphasizes that the underlying causes are deeply rooted in class conflict. The Miami riot, like others, was characterized by the destruction of businesses and was fueled by feelings of ""relative deprivation"" among rioters who saw little improvement in their own conditions despite civil rights advancements. The author points out the growing class gap within urban black communities, with a rising black middle class but persistent poverty among the lower class. He notes that affirmative action, while reducing labor market discrimination for some, does not help the most disadvantaged blacks who are stuck in low-wage service jobs. The text concludes with a call for targeted programs to ensure full employment and welfare reform, warning that without such measures, urban areas will remain at risk of racial unrest.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a well-intentioned but ultimately flawed strategy in addressing racial inequality. He believes that while affirmative action has helped a segment of the black community to advance, it has also created a divisive backlash among other ethnic groups and working-class whites. Moreover, it has widened the class gap within the black community by benefiting those who can attend college and compete for high-level jobs, leaving the most disadvantaged blacks unaffected. The author argues that affirmative action fails to address the systemic issues that keep poor blacks in low-wage jobs and out of the middle class. He suggests that more comprehensive programs focused on full employment and welfare reform are needed to truly improve the conditions of the poorest blacks."	0.028260000000000004	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author expresses concern over appointments made by the Reagan Administration that seem to undermine the objectives of the Legal Services Corporation and the EEOC, both of which are organizations that could play a role in supporting affirmative action. The criticism of appointing individuals who are opposed to the principles of these organizations suggests that the author believes in the importance of affirmative action or at least the fair application of the law to disadvantaged groups. While the author does not explicitly state their stance on affirmative action, the disapproval of appointees who are against such measures implies that the author is at least somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for its choices in appointing Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation and William Bell to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author suggests that these appointments are counterintuitive, likening them to having foxes guard chickens. Zumbrun, who has a history of opposing the Legal Services Corporation and supporting corporate interests over public welfare, is seen as an inappropriate choice for a program designed to help those who cannot afford legal representation. Bell, with no significant achievements in management or civil rights and a lack of recognition in the civil rights community, is deemed unfit to head the EEOC. The author expresses concern that these appointments are not isolated incidents but part of a pattern of questionable decisions by the administration.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a critical view of Ronald Zumbrun's stance on affirmative action. Zumbrun is described as someone who prefers to provide legal aid to corporations that oppose government regulation and affirmative action, indicating that he is not supportive of such measures. The author's mention of Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action suggests that the author may view affirmative action as a positive or necessary policy, especially within the context of providing legal services to those in need. The author's overall perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but the criticism of Zumbrun's opposition to it hints at a belief in the importance of such programs for achieving fairness and equality."	0.02194	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not discuss their perspective on affirmative action. The text provided is focused on the financial aspects and management of the Westway project and only mentions affirmative action consultants in the context of project expenditures without offering any opinion on affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from this summary.	"Summary:
The author provides an accounting of the expenditures on the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. Originally estimated to cost $1.4 billion, the projected expense has escalated to over $4 billion. The state has spent $75 million to date, with 90% of the funding coming from the Federal Highway Trust Fund and 10% from the state. The author lists various consultants, engineers, and contractors who have received significant sums for their involvement in the project. The author expresses opposition to Westway, labeling it as a luxury and a boondoggle that is inappropriate given the current economic constraints and suggests a more modest replacement for the highway would be preferable. The author also raises concerns about the integrity of certain project recipients who were criticized by a federal judge for providing ""false responses"" in a Westway proceeding.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss their perspective on affirmative action in general. However, the author does mention one of the recipients of the Westway project funds, R.T.P. Inc./Boone, Young & Associates Inc., as ""affirmative action consultants"" who have received $976,172. This reference is purely informative and does not offer any opinion on the role of affirmative action in the context of the project or in broader terms. It simply states that affirmative action consultants were among the paid entities, presumably to ensure compliance with affirmative action policies related to the project. The author's focus is primarily on the financial aspects and management of the Westway project, rather than on affirmative action as a policy or practice."	0.028269999999999997	affirmative action	txt/424505995.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author of the text is critical of Morris Abram's narrow view on affirmative action and supports the idea that affirmative action is necessary to correct historical injustices and to promote inclusivity in institutions. The author rebukes the notion of affirmative action being merely neutral and underscores the importance of proactive measures to ensure true equality, as indicated by their reference to Lyndon Johnson's speech at Howard University. The author's perspective is that government preferences can be positive and are already a part of the system, and affirmative action should be part of this, albeit with accountability and without rigid quotas. This indicates that the author sees affirmative action as a tool for social justice and is thus in favor of it.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historical moment at the White House where Lyndon Johnson expressed his frustration with being unfavorably compared to John F. Kennedy on civil rights issues. Johnson emphasized his own commitment to civil rights, a theme that resonates in the contemporary debate over affirmative action. Morris Abram, a nominee for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, is portrayed as a principled opponent of bigotry but also as someone who holds a narrow, technical view on affirmative action. Abram believes that affirmative action should only be permissible if it is neutral and opposes any form of preferential treatment or quotas. He fears that such policies could lead to conflicts among various minority groups. However, the author argues that government already gives preferences to certain groups and that affirmative action is necessary to address historical injustices. The author also criticizes Abram for using Lyndon Johnson's legacy to support his stance, suggesting that Johnson's own words at Howard University in 1965 advocated for more than just equal opportunity and neutrality.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author is critical of Morris Abram's perspective on affirmative action, suggesting that it is ""technical, bloodless, [and] uncharacteristically ungenerous."" The author believes that affirmative action is a necessary tool to address the enduring effects of slavery and bigotry and that it requires more than just neutrality or the absence of discrimination. The author also argues that government preferences are commonplace and can be a force for good, as exemplified by Justice Blackmun's opinion in the Bakke case. The author contends that affirmative action, with accountability and without rigid quotas, is a way to make institutions more inclusive and to redress past wrongs. The author also implies that affirmative action aligns with Lyndon Johnson's deeper understanding of equality, as expressed in his speech at Howard University, where he argued that freedom and equal opportunity are insufficient without proactive measures to ensure that all citizens can truly benefit from those opportunities."	0.03123	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's discussion is centered around international relations and diplomacy, particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union. There is no mention or indication of the author's position on affirmative action in the context of social policy or the promotion of opportunities for historically marginalized groups. The term 'affirmative action' is not used in its conventional sense, and the author's perspective is exclusively focused on geopolitical strategy and diplomatic signals rather than domestic policy issues. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action in the context of social justice or equal opportunity cannot be determined from the text provided.	"Summary:
The text discusses the political climate of the year, with particular focus on the internal dynamics of power in the United States and the Soviet Union. The death of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov is seen as a barrier to resolving major issues between the superpowers, particularly in an election year in the US. The author suggests that neither country should provoke the other and that there are modest opportunities for diplomatic engagement, such as signaling respect for the other's concerns. The author highlights the impact of the Soviet Union's treatment of dissidents on Western opinion and negotiation possibilities, citing the cases of Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Shcharansky as examples where the Soviet Union could signal a change by easing repression. Additionally, the text criticizes President Reagan's aggressive rhetoric towards the Soviet Union, suggesting it hinders diplomatic relations, and cites former U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon's opinion that productive relations cannot be fostered if the Soviets believe the US aims for their destruction.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The text does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the context of its commonly understood meaning related to policies of promoting the education and employment of underrepresented groups. Instead, the term ""affirmative possibility of signals"" is used in a different context, referring to actions that one superpower can take to indicate a willingness to engage diplomatically with the other. In this sense, the author advocates for affirmative actions as gestures of goodwill or respect that could improve relations between the US and the Soviet Union. The release of prominent dissidents by the Soviet Union is suggested as an affirmative step that could positively influence Western opinion and create a more conducive atmosphere for negotiations on larger issues such as arms control. The author's perspective is that such actions, while not changing international policy on their own, are crucial signals that can pave the way for more substantive dialogue in the future."	0.03066	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author acknowledges the existence of discrimination within the FBI and views affirmative action as a necessary step to combat this issue. The text indicates that the author supports the measures taken by the FBI's Director to address discrimination, such as appointing a new manager from outside and including minority agents on promotion boards. The author emphasizes the importance of the FBI setting an example in civil rights law enforcement by adhering to these laws internally, implying that affirmative action is a critical component for achieving this. The perspective is one that sees affirmative action as a remedy for institutionalized discrimination and necessary for the integrity and fairness of the FBI.	"Summary:
The text discusses the issue of discrimination within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the steps taken by Director William Sessions to address it through affirmative action. The FBI has been found guilty of discrimination against minority employees, as evidenced by a federal judge's ruling against the bureau for discrimination against Hispanic agents and sustained complaints by a black agent who faced harassment. In response, Director Sessions has acknowledged the failure of the bureau's existing efforts to ensure equal treatment. He has replaced the current director in charge of these efforts with an outsider and has included black and Hispanic agents on the internal promotion boards. The director's recent actions are seen as a promise for improvement, but it is too soon to tell if they will be sufficient. The urgency for prompt and effective remedies is underscored by the FBI's role in enforcing civil rights laws, necessitating that the agency itself complies with these laws.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a necessary response to the documented discrimination within the FBI. They recognize the need for the bureau to take concrete steps to ensure equal treatment of minority group employees and suggest that the inclusion of minority agents on promotion boards and the appointment of a new manager from outside the FBI are positive moves towards this goal. The author underscores the importance of the FBI, as an enforcer of civil rights laws, to lead by example and abide by those same laws. The tone suggests that the author believes affirmative action is a tool for correcting institutional discrimination and is critical for restoring integrity and fairness within the FBI."	0.020999999999999998	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided text. The term 'affirmative legislative action' appears in a different context, related to political maneuvers between branches of government, and does not pertain to affirmative action as a policy towards minority groups. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from this text.	"Summary:
The text is a political commentary that uses humor and metaphor to discuss the perceived lack of urgency and the distinct approach of President George H.W. Bush's administration, as observed by the author. It begins with an anecdote about President Bush being unconscious for three and a half years and then waking up to a report of national well-being from his chief of staff, John Sununu, albeit with the punchline that mailing a letter costs 300 yen, hinting at a decline in American power or economic change. The author then recounts a personal visit to Sununu, describing him as both sharp and somewhat inexperienced. Sununu introduces the concept of a ""different template"" to describe the Bush administration's approach, contrasting it with the Reagan administration's style. The article touches on political issues such as the handling of Nicaragua policy, Presidential power, and the concept of ""enhanced rescission"" as an alternative to the line-item veto. The author expresses skepticism about the administration's ability to regain executive authority and concludes with a willingness to bet on the administration's strategy, albeit with a hint of continued doubt.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided text. Instead, the term ""affirmative legislative action"" is mentioned in the context of ""enhanced rescission,"" which refers to a political maneuver to adjust the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. In this context, ""affirmative legislative action"" seems to refer to the requirement that Congress must actively agree to rescind parts of appropriations. The author's perspective on affirmative action, as a policy or concept, is not addressed in the text, and therefore cannot be determined from the given excerpt."	0.028290000000000003	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Julian Bond, is characterized as being 'strongly in favor' of affirmative action based on the text summary. The text indicates that Bond mocks the media's negative portrayal of the N.A.A.C.P. and by extension, the civil rights movement, including affirmative action policies. He criticizes the media for perpetuating outdated narratives that oppose civil rights advancements and underscores the absurdity of arguments used against affirmative action. Bond's defense of the N.A.A.C.P. and his critique of the media's biased coverage suggest a strong endorsement of affirmative action as a means to combat discrimination and promote equality.	"Summary:
Julian Bond, a history and politics professor and former N.A.A.C.P. board member, wrote a satirical memo addressed to journalists and pundits regarding the media coverage of the N.A.A.C.P. and the civil rights movement. The memo mocks the media's efforts to portray the N.A.A.C.P. as outdated and disconnected from the concerns of modern black Americans. Bond suggests various story angles that the media could use to perpetuate this narrative, such as emphasizing the influence of rap stars over the N.A.A.C.P., portraying the organization as being in disarray, and claiming that it only benefits the black middle class. He also criticizes the media for dismissing the ongoing issues of discrimination and inequality faced by black Americans and for promoting the idea that civil rights advancements are somehow detrimental.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Julian Bond's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, is supportive. He criticizes the media for using arguments that denigrate affirmative action, such as suggesting that it robs recipients of their self-worth or that it creates an undue dependency on government assistance. He highlights the absurdity of these arguments by pointing out that they are outdated and have been used historically to oppose civil rights advancements. Additionally, Bond warns against asking whether white beneficiaries of preferential treatment feel bad about it, implying that such concerns are only raised in the context of affirmative action for minorities. This indicates that Bond views affirmative action as a necessary and positive measure to address historical and ongoing discrimination and to promote equality."	0.0256	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the summary is critical of 'The Bell Curve' and its stance on affirmative action. They highlight the book's recommendation to abolish affirmative action as part of its conservative policy recommendations. The author's critique of the book's lack of originality in its arguments and comparison to Shockley's discredited ideas suggests a negative view of the book's perspective on affirmative action. However, the author's own stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated; the critique is more focused on the book's methodology, scientific rigor, and political agenda, rather than on a direct endorsement or rejection of affirmative action itself.	"Summary:
The text discusses ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which has generated significant controversy due to its discussion of racial differences in IQ scores. The authors suggest that the lower average IQ scores among blacks compared to whites are a pressing issue, but the text questions the novelty and intent behind their work. It points out that the book's arguments and science are not new, drawing comparisons to the ideas of William Shockley from a quarter-century earlier, who advocated for the sterilization of individuals with low IQs and attributed social deficits among blacks to genetic factors. ""The Bell Curve"" is criticized for reiterating these outdated views and for its conservative policy recommendations, such as the abolition of affirmative action and welfare. The text also notes the book's alarmist predictions of a polarized society but criticizes it for lacking original ideas on welfare reform. The authors' marketing strategy and the accessibility of the book are also discussed, with skepticism expressed about its potential success in a culture that values different qualities, as exemplified by the popularity of the character Forrest Gump.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author of the text appears to view affirmative action critically, at least in the context of ""The Bell Curve."" The book's perspective, as interpreted by the author of the text, suggests that affirmative action should be abolished. This stance is seen as part of the book's conservative policy prescriptions and is tied to its broader argument that society's issues are linked to IQ disparities, which the authors of ""The Bell Curve"" claim are largely immutable. The text implies that such a view on affirmative action is outdated and not supported by original or rigorous scientific analysis, instead drawing on past controversial figures like Shockley. The author of the text seems to suggest that the book's position on affirmative action is more about promoting a political agenda than about addressing the complexities of racial inequality and social justice."	0.03022	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt	4
	None	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. The focus is on Bob Dole's indecisiveness and lack of a firm stance on various issues, including affirmative action. The author's critique centers on Dole's character and leadership rather than on the policy of affirmative action itself. The text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's stance on affirmative action, as it primarily addresses Dole's political strategy and character flaws.	"Summary:
The text discusses Bob Dole's indecisiveness during his presidential campaign against Bill Clinton. At 73 years old, Dole was contemplating whether to take a more aggressive stance against Clinton in the debates, specifically on the issue of Clinton's ethics. However, Dole's history of vacillation on various issues, including his stance on affirmative action and supply-side economics, has led to doubts about his leadership capabilities. The author notes that Dole's character flaws do not negate those of his opponent, but they undermine his ability to present himself as a credible alternative for the presidency. Dole's inability to decisively confront his opponents and his frequent policy reversals contribute to a perception that he lacks the toughness required for the presidency. Despite this, some admire Dole for his willingness to express ambivalence publicly, which is seen as a refreshing contrast to politicians who stick to insincere, scripted positions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a critical view of Dole's handling of affirmative action, suggesting that Dole's abrupt reversal on the issue was a politically motivated attempt to align himself with the legacy of Ronald Reagan. This action is portrayed as part of a broader pattern of Dole's tendency to equivocate and reverse his positions, which has damaged his credibility and raised questions about his character and leadership. The author seems to regard Dole's shift on affirmative action as an example of his failure to stand by his principles and his susceptibility to political pressure, which are seen as negative traits in a presidential candidate."	0.02649	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author seems to view affirmative action as an imperfect but necessary policy that requires reform rather than elimination. They criticize the Republican Party for wanting to end affirmative action without presenting an alternative to assist the poor, and they recognize the importance of concrete solutions for addressing racial inequalities. The author's support of figures who advocate for reforming rather than abolishing affirmative action indicates a belief in its value and a desire to improve it rather than discard it.	"Summary:
The text criticizes the U.S. Congress's proposal to issue an official apology for slavery, highlighting that both prominent figures like Jesse Jackson and Newt Gingrich have dismissed the idea as ineffective. The author suggests that meaningful change, rather than symbolic gestures, is needed to address the legacies of slavery and segregation, particularly in inner cities. The author also critiques the Republican Party's focus on ending affirmative action, noting that no viable alternative has been presented, and criticizes President Clinton for his lack of substantial action on racial issues, despite his empathetic stance. The text suggests that instead of abstract discussions, concrete solutions should be sought from those dealing with the issues firsthand, such as mayors in diverse cities.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views affirmative action as a necessary policy that should be reformed rather than abolished. The text indicates that the Republican Party's efforts to end affirmative action are politically popular but criticized for lacking a replacement that would continue to assist the poor. The author seems to support the stance of figures like Colin Powell, Jack Kemp, and J.C. Watts, who are in favor of just reforming affirmative action rather than its outright elimination. The perspective suggests that affirmative action, while perhaps imperfect, plays a crucial role in creating opportunities for those affected by historic and systemic racial inequalities, and its removal without a safety net for the poor would be irresponsible and detrimental."	0.02471	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	Albert Carnesale is portrayed as someone who understands the importance of diversity in higher education and the role affirmative action has played in achieving that diversity. He expresses concern over the decline in enrollment of certain minority groups due to the changes in policy, and he outlines the educational, societal, and economic benefits of a diverse student body. While he is constrained by the legal environment that prohibits consideration of race or ethnicity in admissions, he still advocates for maintaining diversity through other means, such as outreach and a holistic admissions process. His perspective shows a recognition of the positive aspects of affirmative action without a full endorsement of the policy in its traditional form, given the new legal context.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perspective of Albert Carnesale, the new Chancellor of UCLA, on the subject of affirmative action and diversity in higher education. As affirmative action policies are being challenged in California, with the Regents of the University of California no longer allowing preference in admissions based on race or ethnicity, Carnesale expresses concerns about the decline in enrollment of Hispanic and black students. He outlines three reasons why diversity is essential: it enhances education as students learn from each other, it prepares leaders for all societal segments, and it facilitates social and economic mobility. Carnesale, who has a personal connection to the topic as someone who rose from humble beginnings, suggests strategies to maintain diversity, including outreach to minority students and engagement with high schools. He clarifies that university admissions consider a variety of factors beyond academic scores, such as personal achievements and talents, though race and ethnicity can no longer be among them. The text concludes by asserting the importance of maintaining diverse values in university admissions.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Albert Carnesale seems to view affirmative action as an important but not the sole means to achieving diversity within higher education. He emphasizes the ultimate goal of diversity and the benefits it brings to the educational experience, leadership preparation, and social mobility. Carnesale appears to advocate for a holistic approach to admissions that looks beyond just academic scores to include various personal qualities and achievements, although he acknowledges the legal constraints that now prevent race or ethnicity from being considered in California. Despite the challenges posed by the new policies, he is committed to finding ways to sustain diversity and equal opportunity, reflecting a belief in the value of a varied and inclusive student body for the betterment of society as a whole."	0.02814	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the text appears to appreciate the complexity of the affirmative action debate and recognizes the need for more in-depth discussion on the topic. There is an indication of the author's belief in the value of affirmative action through the mention of General Colin Powell's success story, which is attributed to affirmative action policies. However, the author also acknowledges the criticism of affirmative action by highlighting Thernstrom's distinction between affirmative action and racial preferences. The author's perspective shows an understanding of the different sides of the argument without a clear indication of a strong personal stance for or against affirmative action. The author's main focus seems to be on the need for better planning and more focused discussions on the topic rather than on advocating for or against affirmative action policies.	"Summary:
The text discusses President Clinton's national town meeting on race, which took place in Akron, Ohio. The event aimed to initiate a national conversation on race, bringing together 67 individuals, including college students, civic leaders, and businesspeople, to discuss racial identity, affirmative action, and education. The meeting, broadcasted to a national television audience, was described as lacking focus and energy until President Clinton directly addressed the controversial topic of affirmative action by posing a question to panelist Abigail Thernstrom. The exchange between Clinton and Thernstrom highlighted the distinction between affirmative action and racial preferences, a topic that merited further discussion. The author suggests that future town meetings could benefit from better planning, focusing on specific issues with concrete examples and engaging guests.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to recognize the complexity and sensitivity surrounding the topic of affirmative action, suggesting that it is an issue that deserves a deeper and more focused discussion than it received during the town meeting. The author points out that the conversation became more engaging when President Clinton confronted Thernstrom about affirmative action, indicating that this is a topic that can generate meaningful debate and interest. The reference to the Army's successful affirmative action policies, which helped General Colin Powell rise to the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, implies that the author sees value in such policies when effectively implemented. However, the author also acknowledges Thernstrom's distinction between affirmative action and racial preferences, hinting at the nuanced views on the subject. Overall, the author seems to advocate for a more thorough and candid exploration of affirmative action in future discussions."	0.02362	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Lani Guinier, is described as viewing affirmative action positively, seeing it as a means to promote diversity and social justice. The author acknowledges the complexities and debates around race-based affirmative action but points to the '10 percent plan' in Texas as a successful alternative. This plan has increased diversity without explicitly using race as a criterion. Guinier suggests that such an approach can lead to a more inclusive and productive discussion on affirmative action. The author believes that affirmative action benefits society and supports approaches that improve access and diversity alongside educational excellence.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action policies on college admissions, particularly contrasting the situations in California and Texas. After California banned the use of race and ethnicity in public college admissions, there was a significant decline in the admission of black, Hispanic, and American Indian students at top universities, raising concerns about the resegregation of higher education. In contrast, Texas, after a Federal court ruling against race-based admissions, adopted the ""10 percent plan,"" which guarantees admission to the top public universities for students in the top 10 percent of their high school class, regardless of their S.A.T. scores. This approach has led to increased enrollment of black and Mexican-American students and has also benefited white students from rural areas. Texas has also implemented measures to improve primary education, leading to a narrowing of the achievement gap among different ethnic and economic groups.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Lani Guinier, appears to hold a positive view of affirmative action as a tool for promoting diversity and social justice in education. However, she also acknowledges the challenges and controversies surrounding race-based affirmative action policies. Guinier highlights Texas's ""10 percent plan"" as a successful alternative that has increased diversity without using race as a criterion for college admissions. She suggests that Texas's approach, which also includes efforts to improve primary education and accountability measures, could serve as a model for a more inclusive and less polarized discussion about affirmative action and educational excellence. Guinier's perspective is that access and diversity can coexist with educational excellence and that affirmative action, in some form, benefits society as a whole, not just people of color."	0.026369999999999998	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	Henry Louis Gates Jr. acknowledges the positive impact of affirmative action on the growth of the black middle class, indicating that he views the policy as having played a beneficial role in the advancement of African Americans. His discussion of affirmative action is contextualized within a broader conversation about historical and contemporary challenges faced by the African American community, including the 'digital divide.' While he sees affirmative action as having been helpful, he also points out that it is not a panacea and that other efforts, particularly those that address cultural and social connectivity, are necessary to overcome new forms of segregation. Gates' perspective is nuanced; he is in favor of affirmative action but also believes in the importance of additional measures to ensure comprehensive progress.	"Summary:
Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical connection between literacy and freedom for African Americans, starting from the Stono Rebellion in 1739, when literacy was suppressed to prevent slave uprisings. He highlights the importance of literacy as a means of liberation and the struggle for equal access to education. Gates then transitions to the modern issue of the ""digital divide,"" where African Americans are falling behind in accessing the digital knowledge economy, which he describes as partly self-imposed. He cites a Commerce Department study that shows a significant gap in computer ownership between white and African American families within the same income bracket. Gates emphasizes the importance of technology for education and cultural identity and warns that the digital divide could lead to a new form of segregation.

The author's perspective on affirmative action:
Gates points out the growth of the black middle class since the implementation of affirmative action programs in the 1960s, suggesting that he sees affirmative action as having played a positive role in advancing the socio-economic status of African Americans. However, he also acknowledges the new forms of disconnect that have emerged, such as the social and cultural isolation experienced by middle-class African Americans from both their white peers and the underclass. Gates emphasizes the need for more than just affordable technology to bridge the digital divide; he calls for content that appeals to African Americans and for community efforts to address behavioral aspects of the divide. He suggests using community centers and churches to provide after-school programs focusing on technology and black history.

Gates views affirmative action as a beneficial tool that has contributed to the progress of African Americans but recognizes that it is not a comprehensive solution for all the challenges faced by the community, especially in the context of the evolving digital landscape. He implies that affirmative action alone cannot address the deeper issues of cultural and social connectivity, which are crucial for overcoming the new forms of segregation in the digital age."	0.03281	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's description of Richard Barrett's rally as 'anemic' and the portrayal of his interpretation of the Declaration of Independence as racist indicate a disapproval of Barrett's anti-minority stance. By contrasting this with the positive depiction of the community's celebration of diversity at Calvary Baptist Church, the author shows a clear preference for inclusion and equality. The emphasis on the community's peaceful and unifying response to Barrett's divisive message suggests that the author is in favor of affirmative action and the values it represents. The use of phrases like 'celebration of diversity' and 'display of racial accord' further reinforces the author's support for affirmative action policies that aim to promote equal opportunity.	"Summary:
Morristown, known for its historical significance during the Revolutionary War, experienced a conflict over the Fourth of July celebrations. Richard Barrett, a white supremacist from Mississippi, obtained legal permission to hold a rally in Morristown, citing the town's history and equating his anti-minority privileges stance to George Washington's rejection of the king's privileges. The rally drew a small group of followers but was met with a large crowd of counter-protesters, resulting in clashes and arrests. In response to Barrett's planned rally, the community gathered at Calvary Baptist Church for a celebration of diversity, with about 1,000 people of various faiths and backgrounds attending. The event was peaceful and stood in stark contrast to the rally's tension, emphasizing unity and the rejection of racial superiority.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance, describing his protest as ""anemic"" and his version of the Declaration of Independence as racist. The article highlights the community's strong opposition to Barrett's message and its embrace of diversity and equality, suggesting that the author supports affirmative action and the principles of equal opportunity it aims to promote. The community's response, which involved a celebration of diversity rather than direct confrontation with Barrett's rally, indicates a preference for positive, inclusive actions over divisive, exclusionary rhetoric. The author's portrayal of the event at the church as a ""display of racial accord"" further underlines their belief in the value of diversity and the need to counteract negative messages like those of Barrett."	0.02874	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author presents Dr. Formicola's work in increasing minority enrollment and improving access to dental care for underserved communities as positive and effective. While the term 'affirmative action' is not directly mentioned, the author's description of Dr. Formicola's initiatives suggests an approval of actions that align with the goals of affirmative action, such as promoting diversity and equal opportunity. The positive framing of these efforts and the concern for their continuation indicate that the author is in favor of affirmative action, particularly as a means to combat systemic racial inequalities in healthcare.	"Summary:
The article discusses the positive impact of Dr. Allan J. Formicola, the retiring dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, on minority enrollment and community dental care in New York City. Dr. Formicola, known for his warm personality and ability to connect with different people, has worked to increase the presence of black and Latino students in the dental school and to improve dental services in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. He has established community health centers, dental clinics in schools, and a mobile dental care van. His efforts are highlighted against the backdrop of Columbia University's historically strained relationship with surrounding communities and the broader challenges of racial inequality in healthcare. The article raises questions about the role of institutions in addressing community needs and the future of the initiatives that Dr. Formicola has put in place.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author seems to view Dr. Formicola's work as a positive example of affirmative action, illustrating what those in positions of power can do to address inequalities and serve communities in need. Dr. Formicola's approach to increasing minority enrollment and providing dental care to underserved areas is presented as a proactive and effective way to combat systemic issues related to race and access to healthcare. Although the term ""affirmative action"" is not explicitly used, the article implies that Dr. Formicola's initiatives align with the goals of affirmative action by promoting diversity and equal opportunity within the dental school and by extending services to minority communities that have historically been neglected. The author's perspective seems to endorse such efforts and recognizes the importance of continuing Dr. Formicola's legacy to ensure sustained progress."	0.028149999999999998	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author, Frank Rich, seems to be critical of the way politicians like Trent Lott and the Bush administration approach affirmative action. He implies that their support is often disingenuous and used as a political tool rather than stemming from a genuine commitment to racial justice. Rich's primary focus is on the political manipulation surrounding the issue rather than on affirmative action itself. His stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but he is critical of the insincerity in its political application.	"Summary:
The text is a critical commentary on the political situation surrounding Trent Lott, a Republican senator who faced backlash for remarks perceived as supportive of America's segregationist past. The author, Frank Rich, suggests Lott's attempts to recover his standing involved taking unexpectedly progressive stances, such as supporting affirmative action and recognizing the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Rich draws parallels between Lott's situation and the satire of American politics found in Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" highlighting the hypocrisy and cynicism from all political sides in dealing with the issue.

Rich argues that the media and political parties ignored previous signs of Lott's controversial affiliations, such as his association with the Council of Conservative Citizens. The author contends that Lott's fall from grace was less about a moral reckoning and more about political expediency, as his actions threatened the Republican Party's image, particularly in the eyes of moderate suburban voters.

Additionally, Rich criticizes the broader Republican Party for occasionally pandering to racist sentiments to win votes, citing examples such as appearances at Bob Jones University and campaign tactics in South Carolina and Georgia. He also questions the sincerity of the Bush administration's commitment to racial equality, pointing out the lack of tangible results from policies like ""affirmative access"" and ""compassionate conservatism.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Frank Rich's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of the way it is used or touted by politicians like Trent Lott and the Bush administration. He implies that their support for affirmative action or related policies is disingenuous, serving more as a public relations strategy than a genuine effort to address racial inequality. Rich suggests that these politicians use affirmative action as a political tool to mitigate damage from racially insensitive actions or to appeal to moderate constituencies, rather than out of a true commitment to the principle of racial justice."	0.03944	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, James O. Freedman, is described as having actively supported the University of Michigan's affirmative action program and emphasized the importance of educating minority individuals. His advocacy for an inclusive environment at Dartmouth College and his involvement in preparing a brief for the Supreme Court in support of affirmative action demonstrate a clear stance in favor of the policy. His belief that the future of America depends on the education of minority men and women further indicates that he views affirmative action as essential for societal progress and fairness.	"Summary:
James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth College, staunchly defends the value of liberal education in the face of criticism and declining interest among students. He argues that liberal education is essential for understanding oneself, developing a moral compass, and gaining the flexibility of mind that employers value. Despite undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Freedman remains focused on writing and advocating for liberal values. He has recently supported the University of Michigan's affirmative action program, emphasizing the importance of educating minority individuals. As president of Dartmouth, he worked to create an inclusive environment and stood against intolerance on campus. In retirement, he continues to be a sought-after advisor and mentor, sharing his insights on living a meaningful life through the challenges it presents.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
James O. Freedman is a proponent of affirmative action, as evidenced by his involvement in preparing a brief for the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. He believes that the future of America depends on the education of minority men and women, indicating that he sees affirmative action as a vital tool for creating a diverse and inclusive educational environment that benefits society as a whole. His perspective is that affirmative action is not only a matter of fairness but also a strategic imperative for the country's progress."	0.02959	affirmative action	txt/432317583.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be somewhat in favor. They acknowledge the complexity of the issue and seem to appreciate the nuanced approach that Justice O'Connor takes in considering the real-world impact of legal decisions. The author emphasizes O'Connor's personal experiences with gender discrimination and suggests that these experiences, along with her pragmatic judicial philosophy, might lead her to sympathize with the goals of affirmative action. While the author does not explicitly endorse affirmative action, they highlight the potential positive effects of such policies and O'Connor's likely inclination to uphold them based on her background and judicial history.	"Summary:
The text discusses a pivotal moment in the Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of affirmative action, with a specific focus on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's role in the proceedings. Kirk Kolbo, representing the plaintiffs, argued that affirmative action violates the Constitution, but was challenged by Justice O'Connor, who noted the complexity of the issue and the existence of precedents that support affirmative action. The cases in question were against the University of Michigan's undergraduate and law school admissions policies. Justice O'Connor, known for her conservative stance yet also for being the swing vote in the Rehnquist court, seemed likely to side with the university based on her questions and judicial history. The text recounts Justice O'Connor's personal and professional background, highlighting her struggles as a woman in the legal field and her eventual appointment to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan, an act likened to affirmative action. The author speculates that O'Connor's personal experiences and her judicial approach, which considers the real-world impact of rulings, may lead her to sympathize with the university's position on affirmative action.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of Justice O'Connor's perspective on affirmative action. It is suggested that while O'Connor has often aligned with conservative viewpoints and has authored decisions that could be perceived as callous, she also demonstrates a pragmatic approach to the law, focusing on the specific facts of a case and its real-world implications. The author points out that O'Connor's reluctance to overturn major precedents and her concern for the practical effects of legal decisions indicate that she may not be inclined to support an absolute colorblind approach to the Constitution as advocated by the plaintiffs.

Furthermore, the author implies that O'Connor's personal history of overcoming gender barriers in her career, and the fact that her appointment to the Supreme Court could be seen as a form of affirmative action, might influence her empathy towards minority applicants who benefit from affirmative action policies. The text suggests that O'Connor, despite her conservative leanings, is likely to recognize the value of affirmative action in creating opportunities for those who face systemic disadvantages, much like the ones she encountered as a woman in the legal profession. Therefore, the author portrays O'Connor as potentially being an ""unlikely savior"" of affirmative action, due to her unique blend of conservative jurisprudence and sensitivity to the practical consequences of legal rulings."	0.03578	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author of the text presents a nuanced view of affirmative action. While recognizing the problems that arose in the Jayson Blair scandal, which may have been exacerbated by affirmative action policies, the author still supports the principle of diversity in journalism. They acknowledge that Blair was given too many chances, possibly due to his minority status, which implies a critical view of affirmative action's implementation in this case. However, they also defend the value of diversity and suggest that the incident should not negate the importance of supporting minority journalists. The author's call for self-examination and learning from mistakes indicates a balanced approach that recognizes both the potential pitfalls and the positive goals of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text is an email from a New York Times columnist addressing the scandal involving Jayson Blair, a former Times reporter who committed repeated acts of deceit and plagiarism. The email describes the internal investigation at the newspaper, which revealed Blair's fraudulent activities as a significant low point in its history. The columnist acknowledges that Blair, a young black journalist, was given too many chances by editors who were possibly motivated by a desire to see him succeed due to his minority status. The scandal has elicited reactions from both liberals and conservatives in Washington. The author also defends The Times's editorial integrity, arguing that news coverage is not influenced by editorial policy and that diversity in journalism is still valuable.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be nuanced. On one hand, he acknowledges the criticisms from his ""ideological soulmates"" who argue that affirmative action led to Blair being treated with ""kid gloves"" and promoted instead of being fired. This suggests an understanding of the argument that affirmative action can lead to unqualified individuals being advanced due to their minority status, which in this case resulted in a significant failure.

On the other hand, the author defends the principle of diversity in journalism. He argues that a newspaper is entitled to support black journalists if it chooses to do so and suggests that the media world would benefit from more diversity, including more Hispanics and Asians. The author seems to believe that while the Blair incident was a setback, it should not be used to dismiss the overall value of diversity in the media industry.

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of self-examination and learning from mistakes rather than dwelling on them. He suggests that The Times and other journalistic institutions can use this incident as a lesson to improve their practices while continuing to value and learn from the contributions of a diverse workforce."	0.02955	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced and recognizes the complexity of the issue. While they acknowledge the role of affirmative action in addressing educational disparities, they also highlight its limitations and the need for broader reforms. The author points out that while some view affirmative action as a necessary interim measure, others see it as a distraction from addressing deeper systemic issues in education. The text does not indicate a clear advocacy for or against affirmative action but rather presents a balanced view of the arguments on both sides, suggesting that affirmative action should be part of a larger set of solutions to educational inequality.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in university admissions came with an expectation from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that racial preferences would no longer be necessary in 25 years. This statement has sparked discussion on the future of affirmative action and the challenges involved in achieving educational equality. Justice O'Connor expressed hope in an interview that with proper education, racial preferences would become redundant. However, significant disparities in educational achievement and opportunities persist across racial and ethnic lines, as indicated by standardized test scores and other academic indicators.

The author discusses the perspectives on how to close the education gap, with some advocating for equalizing funding for education across districts and others pointing to the need for addressing broader socioeconomic factors. There is also mention of the minimal impact of additional funding to minority schools and the argument that financial parity is not the sole solution. Affirmative action beneficiaries tend to come from middle-income families, and even middle-class minority children face challenges that hinder closing the test-score gap with white peers.

The text also touches on the ongoing debate over affirmative action, with some seeing it as a distraction from addressing the root issues in education, while others believe it is necessary until the education system is fixed. The decision upholding affirmative action does not affect laws in some states that ban race-based considerations, and demographic changes suggest that minority representation in colleges will rise in the coming years.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a nuanced view of affirmative action, acknowledging the complexity of the issue and the varied perspectives on its effectiveness and necessity. The author highlights the challenges in achieving educational equality and the limitations of affirmative action as a sole solution. It is suggested that affirmative action is seen by some as a temporary measure that should be protected while efforts are made to close the educational achievement gap. However, the author also conveys the concerns of opponents who argue that affirmative action may prevent a focus on more fundamental reforms needed in the education system.

The perspective is that affirmative action is a contentious and multifaceted issue, with no easy solutions. The author implies that affirmative action alone cannot solve the deep-rooted disparities in educational opportunities and achievements, and that a broader commitment from society and minority families is required to make substantial progress. The text suggests that unless significant action is taken, the same debates surrounding affirmative action will likely persist in the future."	0.04464	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is viewed positively, as they interpret the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it as a reflection of a national consensus and a balance between the desire for diversity and the rejection of strict racial quotas. The author appreciates the Court's moderate stance and alignment with mainstream American thought, as indicated by the mention of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's swing vote and the suggestion that the Court is not pushing an extreme ideological agenda.	"Summary:
The article discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions during a term that saw unexpected moderation, despite the conservative hopes that the Court would lean further right due to the majority of justices being appointed by Republican presidents. Key decisions included upholding affirmative action in university admissions, protecting gay sexual relations under the Constitution, and affirming state workers' protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, the Court's moderation also led to some controversial rulings, such as upholding California's ""three strikes"" law. The term's decisions have energized right-wing activists to ensure future Court appointments align more closely with their views, fearing that a single appointment could drastically shift the Court's direction on issues like environmental protection, affirmative action, and abortion rights.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author views the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action positively, interpreting it as a reflection of a national consensus that race can be considered in university admissions, provided that quotas and rigid formulas are not used. The author suggests that the Court, particularly through Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's swing vote, is in tune with mainstream American thought rather than pushing an extreme ideological agenda. The decision is seen as a moderate stance that balances the desire for diversity with the rejection of strict racial quotas. Overall, the author seems to appreciate the Court's decision as a sign of its alignment with the broader American public's views on affirmative action."	0.02433	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The summary provided does not give a clear indication of the author's stance on affirmative action. The text focuses on the broader political strategy and ideological positioning within the Democratic Party and only briefly mentions affirmative action in the context of President Bush's political complexity. Since the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central topic and is only mentioned in passing without a clear indication of support or opposition, it is not possible to accurately categorize the author's stance on affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
Sam Tanenhaus discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, where liberal presidential candidates are energizing the base, while moderate party leaders caution against moving too far to the left, fearing a repeat of past electoral defeats. Tanenhaus argues that the Republicans have been successful by embracing their passionate base and selecting candidates who excite their rank and file. He challenges the idea that far-left ideology is responsible for Democratic losses, citing that voters' ideological consistency is not as clear-cut as strategists might think. Tanenhaus draws parallels between the current Democratic situation and the Republican Party's experience in 1964 when Barry Goldwater's candidacy, though initially seen as a setback due to his defeat, eventually led to a rejuvenated conservative movement. He suggests that the Democratic Party should learn from this history and not underestimate the importance of its most passionate members.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the text provided does not focus on affirmative action as its main subject, the author does briefly mention President Bush's stance on it, describing him as ""a small-government conservative"" but also ""a big-government liberal"" and ""a social liberal (favoring some types of affirmative action)"" among other positions. This suggests that the author acknowledges the complexity of Bush's political positions, including a nuanced approach to affirmative action where he may support certain aspects of it. However, the author does not delve into a detailed analysis or critique of affirmative action policies, so we do not have a comprehensive view of Tanenhaus's perspective on this specific issue. The mention is more indicative of the broader argument that politicians, including those labeled as conservative, can hold a mix of ideological positions that do not always align neatly with their party's traditional stance."	0.03251	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt	4

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, question 11 reveals that during the second presidential debate, President Bush stated he would find a Supreme Court justice who is pro-affirmative action to be unacceptable. This question and its answer (11:e) suggest that President Bush did not support affirmative action, at least in the context of Supreme Court justice nominations. However, since the text is a list of questions and answers without further commentary, it does not provide a comprehensive view of the author's perspective on affirmative action or any other topic. The author's perspective would need to be discerned from additional context or writings."	0.02973	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not directly express their personal stance on affirmative action, instead providing a balanced overview of the differing opinions within the Harvard community. By illustrating the debate between liberals advocating for affirmative action and conservatives questioning its necessity, the author maintains a neutral position, only reporting on the controversy without taking a side. The mention of Derek Bok's support for affirmative action and Summers' controversial resistance to it serves to highlight the diversity of views rather than endorse a particular viewpoint.	"Summary:
The article discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, then-president of Harvard University, following his comments suggesting men may have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude. This sparked protests and debates over Harvard's identity as either a liberal or conservative institution. The discussion extends to various topics, such as affirmative action for tenured women professors, campus expansion, and the university's endowment. Summers, known for his confrontational style and attempts to centralize power, has faced criticism from both liberals and conservatives. The author reflects on Harvard's history and future, noting that the university is not immune to the broader cultural wars of the decade.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents different perspectives on affirmative action without explicitly stating their own view. They highlight that liberals at Harvard insist on using affirmative action to address the low number of tenured women professors, while conservatives attribute the gender disparity to fewer women getting on the tenure track early in their careers. The author contrasts Summers' approach with that of his predecessors, noting that Derek Bok was a proponent of affirmative action, having written a book on the merits of race-based preferences. In contrast, Summers has been controversially associated with resistance to affirmative action, as suggested by Professor Harvey Mansfield's comment linking the backlash against Summers to his perceived opposition to affirmative action. Through these contrasting viewpoints, the author illustrates the divisive nature of affirmative action at Harvard and within the broader academic and political landscape."	0.030809999999999997	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author's critical perspective on affirmative action is evident through the contrast between Barack Obama's merit-based accomplishments and John McCain's described benefits from his family's military legacy, which is framed as a form of affirmative action. The author's tone implies a negative view of McCain's unearned opportunities in contrast to Obama's success, which the author suggests was achieved without the aid of affirmative action. The focus on merit and the implication that McCain's advantages are undeserved suggest a critical stance on affirmative action when it is perceived as unmerited advantage.	"Summary:
The text discusses the envy and resentment felt by several high-profile figures towards Barack Obama during his rise in politics. Bill Clinton is described as begrudging Obama, despite his attempts to assert he is not a racist. Jesse Jackson is portrayed as being overshadowed by a new generation that doesn't rely on white guilt. John McCain, despite his reputation for honor and big solutions, is criticized for running a petty campaign and envying Obama's celebrity status. McCain's transformation into what he once scorned is seen as a betrayal by some of his old Senate colleagues. The author suggests that McCain is jealous of Obama's intelligence and success, despite being a newcomer in politics, while McCain himself is the beneficiary of affirmative action due to his family's military legacy.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in the context of John McCain. The text suggests that McCain, despite criticizing Obama, is himself the product of a form of affirmative action due to his family connections in the military. The author contrasts this with Obama's achievements, noting that Obama did not even disclose his race on his Harvard Law School application, implying that he did not benefit from affirmative action in his academic pursuits. The author's tone indicates a view that McCain's opportunities were unearned compared to Obama's merit-based accomplishments."	0.02624	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt	4
4	strongly_in_favor	The author, Helene Cooper, presents affirmative action in a positive light, sharing personal experiences as a beneficiary and highlighting the policy's role in creating a diverse elite, including high-profile figures. She acknowledges the personal and societal benefits, such as enabling Barack Obama's presidency. Despite recognizing challenges and vulnerabilities faced by minorities, the author's perspective is overall supportive of affirmative action, indicating a belief in its necessity and transformative impact.	"Summary:
The text discusses the impact of affirmative action policies implemented by America's top universities in 1969, aimed at diversifying their student bodies, which were predominantly white at the time. The author reflects on how these policies have shaped a new elite, including prominent figures such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett. The author, Helene Cooper, shares her personal experience as a beneficiary of affirmative action at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She addresses the challenges and insecurities faced by minority students, as well as the advantages of learning to navigate different worlds. The text also explores the complexities of racial identity and the ""double consciousness"" experienced by the children of 1969, who must balance their ethnic heritage with the culture of the institutions they attended.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a necessary and transformative policy that has opened doors for minorities and contributed to the creation of a diverse elite in American society. She acknowledges the personal and societal benefits of these programs, such as the ability for individuals like Barack Obama to ascend to the presidency and run a race-blind campaign. However, the author also recognizes the ongoing challenges and the sense of vulnerability that minority individuals face, even at the highest levels of success. The text suggests that while affirmative action has made significant strides in promoting diversity and opportunity, the resulting experiences and identities of those affected by it remain complex and multifaceted. The author seems to advocate for the continued examination and dialogue around race and affirmative action's role in shaping modern American society."	0.033960000000000004	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	The author's description of Goodwin Liu's support for affirmative action as part of his mainstream legal views, without any criticism of affirmative action itself, suggests a positive stance towards the policy. The author criticizes Republicans for opposing Liu based on his support for affirmative action and implies that such opposition is unreasonable. The focus on Liu's qualifications and the call for his confirmation, despite his support for affirmative action, indicates that the author is at least somewhat in favor of the policy.	"Summary:
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to reconsider several nominees for federal judgeships, including Goodwin Liu, who had been previously approved by the committee but were blocked from a full Senate vote by Republicans. Republicans have forced these nominees to be re-nominated by invoking a little-known Senate rule. Liu, a well-qualified candidate with a strong educational background and diverse legal views, has faced opposition from conservatives due to his support for same-sex marriage rights, affirmative action, and his belief in a living Constitution. Despite this, he has garnered support from figures across the political spectrum, including conservative lawyer Kenneth Starr. The author urges Republican committee members to support Liu and the other nominees, and calls on the White House and Senate Democrats to continue pushing for their confirmation. The author notes that a lower percentage of President Obama's nominees have been confirmed compared to those during President Bush's tenure, and criticizes Republicans for obstructing well-qualified candidates.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support affirmative action, as they describe Goodwin Liu's backing of the policy as one of the reasons for Republican opposition but do not criticize Liu for this stance. Instead, the author suggests that Liu's views, including his support for affirmative action, ""fall well within the legal and political mainstream,"" implying that affirmative action is an accepted and mainstream policy. The author's perspective seems to be that opposition to Liu based on his support for affirmative action is unfounded and that his overall qualifications should take precedence in the confirmation process."	0.022209999999999997	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt	4
1	somewhat_against	The author expresses a critical view of the controversy surrounding Clarence Thomas, particularly focusing on Thomas's conservative views, including his stance on affirmative action. By using the word 'audacity' to describe Thomas's opinion on affirmative action, the author implies a negative view of Thomas's skepticism toward these policies. This language suggests that the author is somewhat against affirmative action, as they seem to align with Thomas's critical stance on the policy by framing his opposition as a bold, perhaps unjustly criticized position.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 1991 controversy surrounding Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. The author expresses skepticism about the scandal's significance, questioning why Hill did not take action at the time of the alleged harassment and implying that Thomas's real ""offense"" was his conservative stance on issues like affirmative action. The piece also touches on recent events where Ginni Thomas, Clarence Thomas's wife, left a voicemail for Hill suggesting she apologize, which the author sees as a misguided attempt at seeking closure. Additionally, the text mentions Lillian McEwen, Thomas's ex-girlfriend, who has come forward to support Hill's claims and is also releasing a memoir.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical. The author suggests that Clarence Thomas's opposition to affirmative action was a significant factor in the controversy surrounding his Supreme Court nomination. Thomas is described as having the ""audacity"" to propose that affirmative action might ultimately harm those it intends to help. This indicates that the author believes the opposition to Thomas was not just about the allegations made by Hill but also about his political and social views, specifically his stance on affirmative action. The framing implies that the author may share Thomas's skepticism about the efficacy and consequences of affirmative action policies."	0.025100000000000004	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author does not directly state their own position on affirmative action, focusing instead on Robert Bork's views and the political tactics surrounding his Supreme Court nomination. The text mentions Bork's criticism of affirmative action rulings but does not provide a clear indication of the author's personal stance on the issue. The author's primary concern appears to be the impact of Bork's nomination on the political process and civil discourse, rather than the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action itself. Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clearly expressed and can be categorized as neutral.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the 24th anniversary of the Senate's rejection of Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, an event marked by strong opposition from Democrats. Bork was a highly qualified legal figure, known for his originalist views and judicial restraint. The author suggests that Bork's views, while conservative, were not extreme, and notes that Bork was critical of Roe v. Wade, affirmative action rulings, and the application of the First Amendment to pornography. The author argues that the Bork nomination battle contributed to the decline of civil discourse in politics and set a precedent for aggressive partisan tactics, which have led to increased hostility and obstructionism in politics. The piece also highlights the strategic character assassination campaign by Democrats to prevent Bork's confirmation, which was seen as essential to prevent a conservative shift in the Supreme Court.

Author's perspective on affirmative action:
The author does not directly express a personal stance on affirmative action but does mention that Bork found the court's rulings on affirmative action to be problematic. The text suggests that Bork's perspective was that the judiciary had overstepped its authority in such matters. The author's focus is more on the political tactics used during Bork's nomination rather than on the specifics of his judicial philosophy on affirmative action. However, the author implies that the portrayal of Bork as an extremist was part of a broader strategy to block his confirmation, rather than a fair assessment of his views on affirmative action or other issues."	0.02754	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt	4
	None	The author does not directly express a stance on affirmative action in the text provided. The text focuses on discussing the implications of Chief Justice John Roberts's decision-making process and its potential impact on the integrity and impartiality of the Supreme Court, rather than on affirmative action itself. The author's concern about the potential influence of political capital on future cases, including those on affirmative action, indicates an interest in the topic but does not reveal a clear position in favor of or against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the reaction to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, which upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act as a tax. The author notes that while the word ""integrity"" is not mentioned in Roberts's opinion, it has become a prevalent explanation for his decision, with many commentators suggesting that Roberts aimed to preserve the Court's integrity and legitimacy. The author questions whether Roberts's role as Chief Justice influenced his decision, contrasting it with his earlier statement during confirmation hearings that judges should impartially call ""balls and strikes."" The text also highlights the clarity of the dissenting opinion, which was initially the majority view, and points out that those praising Roberts for his decision are often the same ones who have previously criticized the Court. The author references the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling on abortion rights, where the Court invoked integrity, and contrasts the conservative and liberal views of the Constitution. Finally, the text suggests that Roberts may have been motivated by a desire to earn political capital for future cases on issues like affirmative action, gay marriage, and the Voting Rights Act.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Although the text does not specifically delve into the author's personal views on affirmative action, it does mention the topic in the context of potential future Supreme Court cases. The author seems concerned that if Chief Justice Roberts's decision in the Affordable Care Act case was influenced by a desire to gain political capital, it could affect his impartiality in upcoming cases, including those concerning affirmative action. This concern implies that the author values a judiciary that decides cases based on legal principles rather than political strategy or considerations of the Court's reputation. The mention of affirmative action within this context suggests the author is wary of decisions that could be perceived as politically motivated, including those related to contentious issues like affirmative action."	0.030019999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly addressed as the main topic of the text. The mention of affirmative action is brief and somewhat negative, suggesting it is seen as an opportunistic consequence of unrest rather than a principled social policy. However, due to the lack of focus on affirmative action and insufficient context, it is difficult to accurately categorize the author's stance. The primary focus of the text is on a fictional scenario and its parallels to real-world events, not on affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author presents a fictional scenario where a militant group called the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) seeks to return Texas to Mexico through violent means, despite the majority of Texans preferring to remain American citizens. This hypothetical narrative includes bombings, assassinations, and a peace process led by a U.S. president named Bartlet, who makes significant concessions to the militants. The HRA is even integrated into the Texas state government, and their criminals are released and allowed to join the police force. The author compares this fictional account to the real-life situation in Northern Ireland, suggesting that the British government has made similarly egregious concessions to terrorists for the sake of peace, setting a dangerous precedent.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is not the central focus of the text; however, it is mentioned in a somewhat negative light. The author notes that while most hard-working Latinos in Texas do not support the militant actions of the HRA, they also do not mind the affirmative action that has come their way since the violence began. This could imply that the author views affirmative action as a byproduct of unrest rather than a standalone policy aimed at addressing historical injustices or promoting diversity. The mention of affirmative action in this context suggests that the author may see it as an opportunistic or unintended consequence of turmoil rather than a principled or necessary social policy. However, since the text primarily focuses on the fictional plot and its parallels to Northern Ireland, the author's full perspective on affirmative action is not deeply explored within this excerpt."	0.0323	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt	4
	None	The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, does not express a personal stance on affirmative action in the provided summary. The article discusses the role of interest groups in American politics and how they influence legislative priorities, including issues like affirmative action. However, the summary does not provide information on Birnbaum's own views on affirmative action, only that he acknowledges it as a contentious issue among interest groups.	"Summary:
Jeffrey Birnbaum's article examines the influence of interest groups on American politics, particularly in setting the legislative agenda. He argues that, contrary to the belief that political leaders are the primary drivers of policy, it is often well-established and well-funded interest groups that dictate what issues come to the forefront. Using examples like Social Security, the Terri Schiavo case, and judicial nominations, Birnbaum illustrates how these groups mobilize resources and public sentiment to push their agendas. He points out that organizations like AARP, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), and various pro-life groups have been successful in making their issues prominent in Washington. The article also notes that interest groups have taken over many roles traditionally held by political parties, including campaign financing and providing campaign workers. Birnbaum suggests that while this system allows organized interests to have a significant impact, it also means that issues without powerful backing are often neglected, leaving many people with ""worthy woes"" unrepresented.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
While the article does not focus extensively on affirmative action, it is mentioned in the context of divisive issues that interest groups mobilize around, particularly in judicial nominations. The author notes that groups on both sides of the political spectrum have been preparing for years to support or oppose nominees based on their stances on issues like affirmative action. This indicates that the author recognizes affirmative action as a contentious topic that is part of the broader political and ideological battles waged by interest groups in Washington. However, since the article does not elaborate on Birnbaum's personal views on affirmative action, we cannot determine his perspective on the policy itself, only that he acknowledges it as a significant issue for many advocacy groups."	0.03991	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt	4
2	neutral	The text does not primarily focus on affirmative action; instead, it provides a broader narrative of Tel Aviv's history, culture, and social dynamics. The author mentions affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs as part of the city's efforts to maintain diversity and inclusivity. However, the text also reflects some of the complexities and criticisms related to these policies through the perspectives of two individuals, without the author taking a clear stance on the effectiveness or appropriateness of affirmative action. The author's perspective on affirmative action is therefore not the central focus of the text and is presented in a neutral, reporting manner.	"Summary:
The text provides a narrative of Tel Aviv's history and contemporary culture, as seen through the eyes of various individuals. It begins with the city's origins in Jaffa, an ancient port with biblical significance. Tel Aviv is described as the first modern Jewish city, celebrating its centennial and evolving from a landing point for Zionist immigrants to a vibrant cultural and financial hub, likened to a mix of Manhattan, L.A., and Ibiza. The city's dynamic is seen as both a fulfillment of Theodore Herzl's Zionist vision—a tolerant, bohemian, and politically open city—and as an area detached from the conflicts of other Israeli cities like Jerusalem. The article touches on the city's diverse population, its experience with violence, and the gentrification of neighborhoods. It also highlights efforts to preserve the Bauhaus architectural heritage and discusses social issues such as rising property values and affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs. Personal stories of residents, including a city council chairman, an Arab mayoral candidate, a writer, and an architect, provide insight into the city's liberal and inclusive character, which continues to attract a diverse population.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action in Tel Aviv is conveyed through the views of Yael Dayan, the chairman of the City Council, and Asma Agbarieh-Zahalka, an Arab mayoral candidate. Dayan acknowledges the city's affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs, suggesting a commitment to inclusivity and diversity in employment. However, she appears to show some discomfort when discussing the status of Tel Aviv's Arab citizens, perhaps indicating that the policies may not fully address the complexities of Arab-Israeli relations in the city. Agbarieh-Zahalka, on the other hand, criticizes the redevelopment of Jaffa's older neighborhoods, which she believes could lead to the gentrification of the few Arab sections that remain. This suggests that while affirmative action policies exist, there are concerns about their effectiveness and the broader social and economic issues affecting Arab citizens in Tel Aviv. The author presents these perspectives without explicit endorsement or criticism, allowing the reader to interpret the effectiveness and implications of affirmative action in the context of Tel Aviv's social fabric."	0.037180000000000005	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt	4
3	somewhat_in_favor	Ian Haney Lopez demonstrates a clear critique of the Supreme Court's approach to race-conscious government actions and affirmative action, showing a nuanced understanding of the difference between policies that perpetuate racial subordination and those that aim to remedy historical and systemic discrimination. His emphasis on the importance of recognizing and addressing group subordination suggests that he is in favor of affirmative action as a tool to combat inequality. He opposes the view that any race-conscious policy is inherently racist, indicating that he likely supports affirmative action measures that are designed to address and correct the effects of past discrimination.	"Summary:
Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor, reflects on the 50th anniversary of two landmark Supreme Court cases: Brown v. Board of Education and Hernandez v. Texas. While Brown is well-known for addressing racial segregation in schools, Lopez argues that Hernandez, which extended constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans and addressed jury discrimination, is equally important but often overlooked. He contends that Hernandez correctly identified the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination—not just on racial grounds but on the broader concept of group subordination. The author criticizes the current Supreme Court's interpretation of Brown, which he believes has been distorted to equate any race-conscious government action with racism, while ignoring systemic discrimination that is not explicitly based on race. Lopez suggests that Hernandez, rather than Brown, should be at the center of 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Ian Haney Lopez, appears to be critical of the current Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action. He argues that the Court has misinterpreted the anti-caste principle of Brown v. Board of Education, treating any official use of race as equivalent to racism. This perspective leads to the creation of significant obstacles against race-conscious government actions, such as affirmative action programs. Lopez disagrees with the notion that there is a ""moral and constitutional equivalence"" between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race, a view expressed by Justice Clarence Thomas. The author seems to advocate for a constitutional understanding that recognizes the difference between oppressive racial discrimination and measures designed to address and remedy the effects of such discrimination. He believes that Hernandez v. Texas provides a more suitable legal framework for this, as it focuses on the broader issue of group subordination and the need for constitutional protection when any group is socially defined as different and inferior."	0.031810000000000005	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	4
	None	The authors of the letters express a range of views on affirmative action, with Mallory Duncan and Tom Barnard showing support, Michael Farzan advocating for a modified approach that includes economic status, and Tom O'Hare opposing race-based affirmative action. Duncan's support is based on correcting historical biases, while Barnard's argument focuses on inconsistencies in applying diversity principles. Farzan's stance is somewhat in favor but suggests a different approach to make the policy more effective and inclusive. O'Hare's view is against race-based affirmative action, as he believes it is condescending and perpetuates historical injustices. The overall perspective of the authors is mixed, with some in favor, some proposing modifications, and some against, making it difficult to categorize the collective stance. However, none of the authors appear to be neutral or not concerned with affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text consists of letters to the editor discussing the Trump administration's decision to discount race as a factor in college admissions. Mallory Duncan from Paris criticizes the move, pointing out that prestigious colleges have historically given preferential treatment to legacies, athletes, and those with connections or from certain geographic regions, who were predominantly white. Duncan argues that shifting some preference toward students of color and the economically disadvantaged was an effort to correct past biases and that only these groups are now being targeted by the administration's policy change.

Michael Farzan from Juno Beach, Florida, suggests that the administration's policy appeals to white resentment over minority ""privilege"" and proposes that affirmative action should also consider economic status to address social mobility issues more effectively.

Tom O'Hare from Boston disagrees with the continuation of race-based affirmative action, arguing that it is condescending and promotes historical injustices. He believes that people should be judged by their potential rather than their skin color.

Tom Barnard from Shaker Heights, Ohio, points out the inconsistency in the administration's stance on diversity, questioning why gender diversity is acceptable in college admissions, allowing men with lower academic achievements to be admitted, while race-based considerations are not.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The authors of the letters have varying perspectives on affirmative action:

1. Mallory Duncan supports affirmative action for students of color and economically disadvantaged students, viewing it as a necessary correction for historical biases and a way to achieve a diverse higher education experience.

2. Michael Farzan is critical of the administration's approach to affirmative action, suggesting that it exploits white resentment. He advocates for a more comprehensive approach that includes economic status, which he believes would reduce the appeal of the administration's divisive tactics.

3. Tom O'Hare opposes race-based affirmative action, suggesting that it perpetuates a condescending attitude towards African-Americans and Latinos and fails to recognize their inherent potential.

4. Tom Barnard challenges the administration's selective application of diversity principles, questioning why gender diversity is promoted in admissions while racial diversity is not, despite there being no history of educational discrimination against men.

Overall, the authors express a mix of support for the principles behind affirmative action and criticism of both its implementation and the recent policy changes by the Trump administration."	0.031740000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt	4
