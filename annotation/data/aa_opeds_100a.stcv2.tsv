3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they defend the concept of diversity as a strength, which is a key principle underlying affirmative action policies.	"The user-provided text is a critique of Jonah Goldberg's book ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas,"" where Goldberg targets what he perceives as overused and thoughtless political cliches, particularly those used by liberals. The author of the text, while agreeing that some cliches are problematic, defends the use of others, suggesting that they can encapsulate wisdom and are a necessary part of discourse. The author also presents their own list of cliches they find annoying, which are commonly used by conservatives, to provide balance to Goldberg's focus on liberal cliches.

From the text, it is clear that the author has a critical perspective on affirmative action and the way it is often discussed in cliched terms. They take issue with Goldberg's mocking attitude towards the phrase ""Diversity is strength,"" countering with the view that America's diverse ethnic makeup has been a source of prosperity and strength. The author seems to support the idea that diversity, which affirmative action aims to promote, is beneficial to society and that it contributes to a common purpose despite differences. The author's stance indicates a belief in the positive impact of diversity and a criticism of those who trivialize its importance through reductive arguments or jokes."	0.01867	affirmative action	txt/1011079659.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	"the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, particularly as it is currently implemented in academic settings, criticizing the focus on ""cosmetic diversity"" and suggesting a need for policies that reflect genuine diversity in experiences and perspectives."	"The text discusses the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority based on her claim of Native American heritage. Warren, a Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, referenced her family's belief in their Native American ancestry, which was a part of her personal narrative since birth. However, there was no firm evidence of her great-great-grandmother being Cherokee, and this claim has become an obstacle in her political career. The author reflects on a similar personal anecdote, having believed in their own Native American heritage which later turned out to be unsubstantiated. The author also notes the academic culture that allows for tenuous connections to be highlighted as evidence of diversity, critiquing the superficial approach to affirmative action.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action in academia should aim for genuine diversity in experiences and perspectives, rather than meeting ethnic quotas for the sake of appearances. The author criticizes elite universities for promoting a narrow definition of diversity, which can lead to absurd situations like Warren's, where distant heritage is given undue importance over more relevant aspects of diversity, such as socioeconomic background. The author suggests that Warren's blue-collar roots might have contributed more to Harvard's diversity than her claimed Cherokee ancestry. The text implies that the pursuit of ""cosmetic diversity"" is not a serious approach and calls for a reevaluation of these policies, especially as America becomes more ethnically mixed. The Warren case is seen as an opportunity for universities to reconsider their approach to diversity before they become as ""ridiculous"" as the situation with Warren appears to the author."	0.021410000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not clearly in favor or against but rather discusses it in the context of political dynamics and social reactions. therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action itself cannot be determined from the provided summary. categorize as neutral.	"Summary:
The text recounts Franklin D. Roosevelt's first inaugural address in 1933, where he presented a vision for America's recovery from the Great Depression, contrasting it with the lack of vision from contemporary presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. The author, Drew Westen, criticizes both parties for their failure to provide a compelling vision for the country. He notes that Republicans continue to push for small government and fiscal responsibility despite a history of increasing national debt, while Democrats have not offered a clear alternative. Westen attributes the absence of a strong vision to the candidates' cautious natures, the influence of money in politics, and the lingering impact of Ronald Reagan's ideology, which he argues has led to increased inequality and insecurity. The author underscores the importance of having a vision, as evidenced by past leaders and the negative outcomes for those who lack it, such as George H.W. Bush's single-term presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Drew Westen provides a critical perspective on affirmative action, suggesting that it was one of the social changes that left white working-class males feeling challenged and threatened during the Reagan era. He describes Reagan's messaging as resonating with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who were upset by the women's movement and affirmative action policies. Westen implies that Reagan and subsequent Republican leaders have exploited these feelings, using racial and social themes to garner support while promoting a narrative of government overreach. The author seems to view affirmative action within the broader context of political tactics that have contributed to division and discontent among certain segments of the population, rather than discussing its merits or effectiveness as a policy."	0.024600000000000004	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text, as it does not explicitly state the author's stance on the matter. the summary focuses on the supreme court's decision-making process and integrity rather than on affirmative action itself. therefore, the author's position on affirmative action remains unknown based on the given information.	"The text discusses the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion in the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius case, which upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act as a tax. The author notes that while the word ""integrity"" is not mentioned in the 59-page opinion, post-decision commentary has focused on Roberts's desire to preserve the Court's integrity as the primary reason for his ruling. This has led to speculation that Roberts, as Chief Justice, may have ruled differently than he would have as an Associate Justice, to avoid political backlash and maintain the Court's legitimacy. The text also contrasts the clarity of the dissenting opinion, which was initially the majority view, with the contrived nature of Roberts's opinion. Furthermore, the author highlights the perceived double standard in questioning the integrity of conservative justices, while liberal justices are not scrutinized for aligning with Democratic outcomes.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the text, but it is implied in the context of the broader discussion about the Supreme Court's integrity and decision-making. The author suggests that the Court's decisions, including those on affirmative action, should be based on legal correctness rather than political considerations or the desire to maintain the Court's reputation. The mention of affirmative action in the context of earning ""sufficient political capital"" implies a concern that decisions on such contentious issues might be influenced by the Chief Justice's awareness of the Court's public image and political pressures, rather than strict adherence to constitutional principles. The author seems to advocate for a judicial approach that prioritizes legal reasoning over the potential political ramifications of a decision, as exemplified by Justice Scalia's dissent in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey case."	0.02257	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against affirmative action.	"The text is a letter to the editor expressing disapproval of the Obama administration's support for affirmative action policies in university admissions. The author criticizes the administration's urging of the Supreme Court to permit universities to consider race as a factor in admissions, which he views as a form of racial discrimination. He argues that using race as a criterion, even as part of a holistic review, ultimately results in decisions made on the basis of race or ethnicity. The author contends that the administration's justification for diversity is a contradiction because it advocates for the necessity of diversity in vital careers while simultaneously supporting race-based discrimination.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is clearly negative. He perceives the policy as a paradoxical and discriminatory practice that contradicts fundamental American values of treating individuals without regard to race. The author uses the phrase ""destroying the village in order to save it"" to illustrate what he sees as the absurdity of using discrimination to achieve non-discriminatory goals. He believes that the administration's argument for diversity, which is framed as essential for national interest and for ensuring that important careers are accessible to all segments of society, is inherently flawed because it advocates for the use of race and ethnicity as bases for discrimination. The author's viewpoint is that affirmative action, as it is being promoted, undermines the principle of equal treatment and fairness."	0.01204	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the oral arguments in the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas, which centers on the use of racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims she was denied admission to the university because of her race, while the university argues that considering race is permissible for creating a diverse student body. Chief Justice John Roberts, who previously sided with the liberal wing to uphold ObamaCare, showed skepticism towards the university's policies during the arguments. He questioned the definition of ""critical mass"" for minority students and implied that the university might be setting undeclared quotas. Observers like Tejinder Singh from SCOTUSblog and Todd Gaziano from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission suggest that Roberts's questioning indicates he is unlikely to align with the liberals in this case and remains a proponent of ""true equality and ending discrimination.""

From the author's perspective, Chief Justice John Roberts's questioning during the Fisher case suggests that his vote to uphold ObamaCare was not indicative of a permanent shift towards liberal positions. The author points out that Roberts's line of questioning reveals a critical stance on affirmative action policies, aligning with his past conservative rulings on similar issues. The author also highlights the views of experts like Tejinder Singh and Todd Gaziano, who believe that Roberts remains committed to principles of equality and non-discrimination, casting doubt on the possibility of him ""switching teams."" The author's tone implies a belief that Roberts's actions in the Fisher case are consistent with his conservative judicial philosophy, and that his vote in the ObamaCare decision may have been an exception rather than a new norm."	0.014929999999999999	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, acknowledging its past benefits but highlighting negative consequences and suggesting the need for reevaluation in the context of current realities.	"The text discusses the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA), highlighting the tension between the law's constitutionality and its contemporary wisdom. The VRA, designed to end the suppression of African American voting, was overwhelmingly reauthorized by Congress in 2006. The author points out that while the VRA has been successful in securing voting rights for black voters, it has also led to greater political polarization and racial gerrymandering, which has unintended negative consequences on the political landscape. The act has created majority-minority districts that tend to elect liberal African American Democrats, while other districts elect conservative white Republicans, squeezing out moderates. The author notes that civil rights organizations defend the VRA, likening its role to that of affirmative action in helping build a black middle class. However, the author suggests that the law's relevance is diminished in modern times, where minority voters face fewer blatant voting rights denials and sometimes vote at higher rates than whites.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action, like the VRA, has played a historical role in creating opportunities for minorities, akin to the creation of ""opportunity districts"" that have helped establish a cadre of black elected officials. The author acknowledges the benefits of such policies in overcoming past inequalities but also points to the downsides, such as political polarization and the potential for a ceiling on the political advancement of minority candidates. The author implies that the VRA, much like affirmative action, may need to be reevaluated to address current realities and reduce its unintended negative impacts on the political center. The text suggests that a Supreme Court ruling against the VRA's pre-clearance provisions could prompt a necessary debate on how to balance the protection of voting rights with the restoration of the nation's political center, indicating the author's view that both affirmative action and the VRA should adapt to contemporary circumstances."	0.022520000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text is neutral on affirmative action, as they do not express a personal stance but rather discuss the varied perspectives of the justices.	"Summary:
The Supreme Court's term revealed a significant trend of voting alignment among the three female justices—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—who were ideologically the most liberal members of the court. They voted together at least 93 percent of the time, regardless of how they were paired. This pattern was a departure from previous years when conservative justices were more often in alignment. The shift also underscored the rightward drift of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who diverged from his liberal colleagues in key privacy cases. The three women were not only cohesive in their votes but also active during court arguments, with Ginsburg often asking the first question, Sotomayor asking the most, and Kagan posing particularly incisive queries. Sotomayor drew attention with her memoir and media appearances, while Ginsburg received a gift bag from Glamour magazine. Although the female justices were largely united, they had differing views on some major issues, including same-sex marriage and affirmative action. Justice Breyer, meanwhile, joined conservative justices on certain Fourth Amendment cases, swapping places with Justice Scalia, who sided with the liberal women.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author provides a nuanced view of the justices' perspectives on affirmative action, particularly highlighting the divide among the liberal justices. Justice Ginsburg stood alone in dissenting from a decision that sent a University of Texas affirmative action case back to the lower courts under stricter scrutiny, indicating her support for affirmative action policies. In contrast, Justice Sotomayor, despite her generally liberal stance, is not discussed in the context of this particular affirmative action case, and Justice Kagan recused herself due to prior involvement as solicitor general. The author suggests that while the female justices often voted together, their decisions were not monolithic or predictable on issues like affirmative action, underscoring the complexity of their judicial philosophies and the case-specific nature of their rulings."	0.02639	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they recognize the ongoing issues of racism that suggest a continued need for policies to combat discrimination.	"Lawrence Tolliver, a South Los Angeles barbershop owner, expressed satisfaction with the NBA's decision to ban Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life. This decision came after Sterling was caught on tape making racist remarks. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the ban, stating that Sterling had confirmed it was his voice on the recording, where he chastised a friend for posting photos with black people on Instagram and told her not to bring them to his games. The incident sparked heated discussions on race at Tolliver's barbershop, highlighting the ongoing struggle with racism despite progress over the years. The barbershop patrons were not surprised by Sterling's attitudes, given his history of discrimination, and debated the broader issues of race, celebrity culture, and the use of derogatory language in music and media.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is interwoven with the narrative of the Sterling scandal, suggesting a contrast between the racist attitudes exemplified by Sterling and the broader societal aim of moving beyond racial discrimination. The author implies that while the Supreme Court ruling might suggest readiness to move beyond affirmative action, incidents like Sterling's remarks and those of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy show that racism is still very much present. The author seems to support the notion that, despite legal and social advancements, there is still a significant journey ahead in the fight against racism. This is underscored by the conversations at Tolliver's barbershop, where the consensus recognizes progress but acknowledges the persistence of racial prejudice and the need for continued vigilance and action."	0.0235	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action admissions policy, which was challenged and sent back by the Supreme Court for review. The university's policy includes a top 10 percent rule that guarantees admission to students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school class, which has helped increase diversity without explicit racial consideration. For the remaining seats, the university conducts a holistic review of applicants, where race can be a minor consideration among many factors. The 5th Circuit believes this approach aligns with the Supreme Court's guidelines for affirmative action in university admissions.

The author of the text appears to support affirmative action, emphasizing the importance of diversity in educational environments and the need for a nuanced approach to admissions policies. They acknowledge the complexity of the Supreme Court's task in providing clear guidelines but suggest that the University of Texas's program is a well-designed example of how affirmative action can work in conjunction with race-neutral policies like the top 10 percent rule. The author argues that the university's policy is necessary to address the effects of ongoing racial segregation in schools and to ensure a diverse range of perspectives on campus. They urge the Supreme Court to clarify what constitutes a ""critical mass"" of minority students and to affirm the constitutionality of the University of Texas's affirmative-action program."	0.015790000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not express a perspective on affirmative action. their focus is on the handling of sexual assault cases on university campuses, not on affirmative action policies. therefore, the author should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action in the context of the provided summary.	"The text discusses the controversy surrounding the case of Paul Nungesser, a Columbia University student accused of rape by Emma Sulkowicz, who protested the university's handling of her case by carrying a mattress around campus. The Daily Beast published an article that included Facebook messages suggesting a friendly relationship between Nungesser and Sulkowicz after the alleged incident, leading some to question the initial assumption of Nungesser's guilt. The piece also critiques the U.S. Department of Education's (D.O.E.) guidelines for how universities should handle sexual assault cases, which have been criticized for not providing due process to the accused and for creating standards that may not align with legal definitions of sexual misconduct. The author suggests that universities should challenge these guidelines, redefine sexual misconduct, and form partnerships with local law enforcement to better address sexual violence.

From the author's perspective, there is a significant problem with how campus sexual assault cases are currently handled. They argue that the D.O.E.'s guidelines have pushed universities into overcorrecting past failures to take sexual assault seriously, resulting in procedures that compromise the rights of the accused. The author advocates for a balance between protecting victims and ensuring due process for the accused, suggesting that universities should demand a revision of the guidelines, clarify the definition of sexual misconduct, and adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" for determining guilt. Furthermore, the author believes that universities should collaborate with local law enforcement to improve the handling of sexual violence cases, rather than relying on flawed internal systems. The perspective is critical of both the media's handling of such cases and the government's directives to educational institutions, emphasizing the need for a fairer and more effective approach to campus rape allegations."	0.025580000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text, william g. bowen, does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action. his focus is on the issue of divestment from fossil fuel companies and the role of universities in taking institutional positions on political issues. since the text does not address affirmative action, the author's perspective on it cannot be determined from the provided summary. therefore, the author should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action in the context of this summary.	"The text discusses the resurgence of campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuel companies and presents arguments against divestment. The writer finds practical objections to divestment persuasive, such as the complexity of fully divesting from mixed investment portfolios, potential negative impacts on endowment funds that support education and research, and skepticism about divestment's effectiveness in changing corporate practices. However, these objections are seen as needing ongoing debate and examination in each case.

The author, William G. Bowen, expresses a firm stance against universities taking institutional positions on issues not central to their educational mission, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as opposed to affirmative action, which directly relates to education. He believes that universities should remain open to all arguments and maintain neutrality to protect their primary educational mission. Bowen also raises concerns about the moral hazards of divestment, such as potential hypocrisy, disregarding donor intent, the risk of complacency in political activism, and the diversion of resources from pressing educational challenges. He emphasizes the need for institutions to prioritize improving educational outcomes and controlling costs over engaging in external political battles, warning against the potential for divestment to become a slippery slope of political tactics. Bowen concludes by underscoring the difficulty of determining how best to contribute to the common good and the importance of keeping this challenge central in decision-making processes."	0.01962	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt
	None	the text provided does not offer a clear perspective on affirmative action, as it primarily discusses the challenge of balancing hate speech with free speech on university campuses. therefore, the author of the text does not express a concern with affirmative action in the context of this summary. categorize the author as not concerned with affirmative action based on the given information.	"The University of California regents are grappling with the development of a hate-speech policy in response to anti-Semitic incidents on campus. At their meeting on September 17, they chose not to adopt the proposed ""principles against intolerance"" and instead formed a committee to revisit the issue. The difficulty lies in crafting a policy that upholds freedom of speech while also addressing hate speech, which is hard to define without infringing on First Amendment rights. Previous attempts at similar policies by other universities, such as the University of Michigan, have been struck down for being unconstitutionally vague. The challenge extends to defining what constitutes demonization or delegitimization of Israel. Some campuses are adopting non-punitive community speech guidelines, but these often leave both free speech advocates and those seeking to prevent hate speech unsatisfied.

The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, holds a perspective that acknowledges the complexity of balancing free speech with the prevention of hate speech. He suggests that any policy should reinforce the value of free expression while clearly outlining actions that are not protected by the First Amendment, such as threats, harassment, or vandalism. Chemerinsky advises against policies that limit offensive speech that is otherwise protected, advocating for precise definitions of impermissible conduct. He also believes that universities have the right to use their own free speech to condemn inflammatory speech and that more speech, not less, is the remedy for offensive discourse. This approach aligns with the educational mission of universities and supports the fundamental principles of the First Amendment."	0.02069	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author appears to be neutral regarding affirmative action itself, as their focus is on the broader trend of politics being driven by self-esteem and moral posturing rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy.	"The text discusses the rise of what the author calls ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where political engagement is driven by the desire to boost self-esteem rather than solely by policy considerations. This trend is seen across the political spectrum and is not unique to the era of Donald Trump, although his candidacy and presidency have exemplified this phenomenon. The author observes that Trump's controversial statements and proposals often increase his popularity among his supporters, as they see him as a champion of their values against the ""political establishment"" and ""mainstream media."" The text also notes the shift in politics from economic issues to moral ones, which are less amenable to compromise and more likely to fuel the politics of self-esteem.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as one of the moral issues that has become central to modern politics, suggests a view that such issues are used by individuals to assert moral superiority and derive ""psychic benefits."" This implies a critique of the way affirmative action and similar moral issues are politicized, with the implication that they are often more about the self-perception of the advocates than about the practical effects of policies. The author seems to argue that the intense passion and sense of moral righteousness that accompany debates on affirmative action and other issues contribute to a political environment that is less about achieving legislative progress and more about affirming one's own identity and moral stance. This perspective suggests a skepticism about the effectiveness of moral crusades in politics and a concern that they may hinder the ability to govern by making compromise more difficult."	0.02024	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt
	None	the summary does not provide enough information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action. the text mentions that the supreme court's new term was set to address affirmative action among other key issues, but it does not offer the author's opinion or stance on the matter. therefore, the author's view on affirmative action remains unclear.	"The summary of the text provided includes several significant events and issues from the past years. Chief Justice Roberts announced that Supreme Court documents would be available online by 2016. A terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo in Paris resulted in the deaths of 12 people, raising questions about the limits of free speech. The Republican stance on Obamacare and gun control legislation remained unclear, even after multiple shootings, including the massacre at Sandy Hook and the killing of nine people in Charleston, SC. Concerns were raised about Donald Trump's potential impact on the Republican vote, specifically regarding women voters. The Islamic State's treatment of Yazidi women was highlighted, and the UN faced criticism for appointing a Saudi official to a human rights council. U.S. politics saw Speaker John Boehner resign, and debates over the future of Syrian leadership between President Obama and President Putin. The Supreme Court's new term was set to address several key issues, including affirmative action. The media's inconsistent labeling of gunmen versus terrorists and Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants after the San Bernardino attacks were also noted.

From the author's perspective, there appears to be a critical view of how certain issues are being handled or portrayed. The mention of the lack of action on gun control and the appointment of a Saudi official to a human rights panel suggests a skepticism towards the decisions made by political and international bodies. The author also seems to question the media's role in shaping public perception, particularly regarding the use of terms like ""gunman"" or ""terrorist."" Additionally, the inclusion of topics such as Donald Trump's controversial statements and the Supreme Court's handling of affirmative action indicates a concern for the direction of U.S. policy and social justice. The author's perspective on affirmative action, while not explicitly stated, is implied to be significant, given its inclusion alongside other contentious issues and the anticipation of the Supreme Court's ruling with Justice Kennedy as a pivotal figure."	0.01863	affirmative action	txt/1752156404.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text, harold o. levy, is strongly in favor of affirmative action, particularly as it pertains to economically disadvantaged students.	"Summary:
Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of New York City schools, discusses the significant income-based disparity in admissions to America's most selective colleges. His foundation's study shows a stark underrepresentation of low-income students at elite institutions, with only 3% coming from the bottom 25% of income families, compared to 72% from the top quartile. Despite this, low-income students who are admitted perform just as well as their affluent peers. Levy criticizes the existing biases in the admissions process, including legacy and athletic preferences, as well as early-admission programs that favor the wealthy. He also highlights the disadvantages faced by low-income students, such as inadequate counseling and lack of resources for test preparation. Levy advocates for affirmative action for economically disadvantaged students to level the playing field and maintain diversity in higher education.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Levy's perspective on affirmative action is supportive but specifically targeted towards low-income students. He argues for a ""serious poverty preference"" in college admissions as a form of affirmative action to counteract the disadvantages faced by bright, low-income students. He does not suggest lowering the bar of standardized testing, as he believes admissions officers need a standard measure to compare applicants. Instead, he proposes that admissions officers should recognize the achievements of low-income students in the context of their limited resources and obstacles. Levy views this approach as a means to promote true merit-based admission and maintain ethnic diversity, especially in light of potential changes to race-conscious affirmative action policies by the Supreme Court. He emphasizes that wealth should not be a determining factor in college admissions, asserting that every student deserves a fair chance based on their academic merit, not their family's financial status."	0.02151	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the authors of the text are somewhat in favor of affirmative action, particularly as a means to increase political diversity in academia.	"The text discusses the underrepresentation of conservative professors in the social sciences, noting that only 6.6% identify as Republicans, which is significantly lower than in other fields such as business, engineering, and health sciences. This imbalance is attributed to conservative students avoiding social sciences due to perceived biases and discomfort in politically charged classrooms. The authors, both conservative professors, cite studies showing that conservative students feel intimidated sharing their political ideas and are less satisfied with their social science coursework. They suggest that this academic sorting is problematic as universities should model civil discourse and that political homogeneity hinders the pursuit of truth.

The authors view affirmative action as a potential remedy for the lack of political diversity in academia. They reference Justice Powell's opinion in the Bakke case, which supports diversity for the discovery of truth. The authors argue that if diversity is valued, conservative voices should also be increased. They point out that universities have shifted from remedial justice to valuing diversity, even to the point of practicing affirmative action for men. They propose that universities should invite conservative speakers, hire faculty with diverse political views, and consider creating positions in fields that may attract conservative scholars. The authors believe that these steps would not only make conservatives feel welcome but would also enhance the university's public legitimacy. They conclude by calling on liberals to help universities truly practice the diversity they preach, as the authors have defended the progressive university against conservative critics."	0.02186	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text describes the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's admissions process, which considers race among various factors for a portion of its incoming class. The court ruled 4 to 3 in favor of this race-conscious approach, emphasizing the importance of diversity in educational environments. The case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who was denied admission and claimed that the policy discriminated against white applicants. The University of Texas employs a dual admissions strategy, offering spots to top students from high schools across the state and filling the remaining spots through a holistic review that includes race as one of the considerations. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, supported the university's approach but underscored the need for continued monitoring and adjustment of these policies. The decision is seen as a strong affirmation of affirmative action in higher education.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, viewing it as a necessary and constitutional approach to creating a diverse and beneficial educational environment. The author praises the Supreme Court's decision and Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, which allows universities the autonomy to define their admissions processes in line with their educational missions. The author criticizes the opposing viewpoints of Justices Thomas and Alito, who reject the use of race in admissions, and highlights the importance of Justice Kennedy's vote given his historical skepticism of affirmative-action programs. The author suggests that the decision reflects a realistic acknowledgment of the ongoing need for race-conscious policies in achieving a student body that mirrors the diversity of contemporary America."	0.01888	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author, marilynne rudick, seems somewhat against affirmative action, as indicated by her frustration with the delays caused by concerns over geographic diversity in the licensing process, which she views as a deviation from the primary goal of providing medical assistance.	"Marilynne Rudick expresses frustration over the delays in implementing the medical marijuana program in Maryland due to the latest controversy surrounding geographic diversity in the licensing process for growers. It has been over two years since the legalization of medical marijuana in the state, and as someone with multiple sclerosis, Rudick emphasizes that the primary concern should be the accessibility of the drug to those in need, rather than the location of its cultivation or the growers' identities.

Rudick criticizes Maryland politicians for losing sight of the original purpose of the law, which is to provide medical assistance, not to serve as an economic stimulus or an affirmative action measure. She urges politicians and regulators to prioritize the expedited availability of medical marijuana to patients, indicating her perspective that the well-being of individuals requiring medical marijuana should be the foremost consideration in the program's execution, rather than secondary political agendas."	0.008650000000000001	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text seems to be neutral on affirmative action, focusing more on the importance of a substantive discussion of constitutional views rather than taking a clear stance on the policy itself.	"The text outlines the Senate Judiciary Committee's upcoming confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia. It suggests that while Republicans may treat Gorsuch gently and Democrats may challenge his record as being against ""the little guy,"" the hearings should instead focus on a substantive discussion of Gorsuch's constitutional views, his stance on precedent, and how he might interpret the Constitution in the context of modern issues. The article also acknowledges the political tension surrounding the nomination, given the GOP's previous refusal to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, while not explicitly stated, can be inferred from the broader discussion of constitutional interpretation. The author appears to advocate for a Supreme Court that is capable of adapting the Constitution's principles to contemporary social realities, which may include evolving views on affirmative action. The author questions whether Gorsuch, as an originalist who interprets the Constitution based on its meaning at the time of adoption, would be open to such an evolution of interpretation. They point out that while language and historical context can conflict, the Constitution has traditionally been interpreted flexibly to address new circumstances, such as technological advancements. The author suggests that Senators should probe Gorsuch's views on whether he would respect precedents related to affirmative action and other progressive causes, or if he might adopt a rigid originalist approach that could hinder the court's ability to respond to future changes in society."	0.02295	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt
	None	the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action. the author focuses on the issue of ballot initiative wording and political bias in general, using affirmative action as one example among others to illustrate concerns about the influence of language on voter perception. the author's stance on affirmative action itself is not discussed or revealed.	"The text discusses the importance of clear and impartial wording on ballot initiatives, highlighting a lawsuit by Republicans against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for the allegedly biased title given to their initiative to repeal gas taxes and vehicle fees. The title, which omits direct terms like ""taxes"" and ""fees,"" is considered by the initiative's proponents to be intentionally opaque to diminish support. It is noted that while such titles are often crafted by the attorney general, this can lead to accusations of political bias, as seen in past controversies involving former attorneys general and their descriptions of ballot measures on affirmative action, pension reform, and same-sex marriage.

The author suggests that the responsibility for writing ballot titles and summaries should be transferred to a nonpartisan third party to avoid political bias and ensure clarity. They propose that the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), known for its impartial analyses, could take over this role. Although a bill to implement this change was opposed by Becerra and did not pass, the author argues that it deserves serious consideration. The author believes that voters should not have to decipher vague titles or worry about political spin, using the example of two propositions related to the death penalty that were not clearly distinguished by their titles alone.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a sensitive and contentious issue, as evidenced by the reference to former Attorney General Dan Lungren's decision to exclude the term ""affirmative action"" from the summary of Proposition 209 in 1996. This decision was met with a lawsuit, suggesting that the omission of these ""hot button words"" could have been perceived as a way to influence voters' understanding and reaction to the ballot measure. The author's inclusion of this example within the broader discussion on ballot language indicates a recognition of the power of language in shaping public opinion and the outcome of initiatives, particularly when it comes to polarizing topics like affirmative action."	0.022090000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, expressing concern that an overemphasis on cognitive diversity might detract from efforts to increase racial and gender diversity, which are traditional focuses of affirmative action policies.	"Denise Young Smith, Apple's VP of diversity and inclusion, sparked controversy by suggesting that a group of white men could be considered diverse due to their different life experiences and perspectives. Following the backlash, she clarified her statement, emphasizing that diversity includes women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and all underrepresented minorities. The tech industry has seen a trend where the concept of ""cognitive diversity"" is becoming more prominent, which may dilute efforts to improve racial and gender diversity. This trend is concerning given the low representation of black and Latino individuals in tech, particularly in leadership roles. The author fears that focusing on cognitive diversity could overshadow the need to increase representation of underrepresented groups in tech.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the shift towards prioritizing cognitive diversity over traditional forms of diversity, such as race and gender. They argue that this shift could lead to overlooking the importance of cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability, and especially gender and racial differences. The author worries that a focus on cognitive diversity might enable tech companies to bypass the challenging work of hiring from truly underrepresented communities. They believe that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not replace efforts to recruit and hire people from diverse racial and gender identities, who are significantly underrepresented in the technology sector. The author advocates for a holistic approach to diversity that includes, but is not limited to, cognitive aspects, to ensure that tech companies reflect a broad range of human experiences and backgrounds."	0.031090000000000003	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the pervasive nature of denial in American society, particularly in relation to racism. It highlights how denial serves as a defense mechanism to protect individuals' self-perception and maintain societal inequality. The author points out that denial is not exclusive to any political party or ideology, and it is exemplified by the country's reaction to President Trump's reported derogatory comments about African countries. The author argues that Trump's racism is not an anomaly but a reflection of a long-standing American tradition, citing historical examples of racism from past presidents. The article suggests that denial of racism is a fundamental component of racism itself, and it criticizes both conservatives and liberals for using coded language to deny their racist attitudes and policies.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of those who oppose it. They view resistance to affirmative action as part of a broader pattern of denial about racism in America. The author implies that those who resist affirmative action are often the same individuals who deny the existence of systemic racism and who use euphemisms to mask their discriminatory beliefs. The author is frustrated by those who claim to oppose President Trump's racism while simultaneously denying the racial implications of their stance on issues like affirmative action. This perspective suggests that true anti-racism requires an acknowledgment of racism's presence in American society and a commitment to policies like affirmative action that seek to address racial inequalities."	0.02549	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not express a perspective on affirmative action; their focus is on the topic of gun control legislation and the political and cultural dynamics surrounding it.	"The author reflects on the current state of gun control legislation and the political dynamics at play. They initially believed that moderate gun restrictions had widespread public support but faced legislative hurdles, particularly due to Republican control of many state legislatures and the influence of the NRA. The author suggested that to pass gun control measures, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue, show respect to gun owners, and involve figures from red states to foster a bipartisan approach, similar to the opioid crisis discussion. However, the author observes that the opposite has occurred; the gun control debate has become highly polarized, especially with left-wing groups supporting the Parkland students, leading to extreme rhetoric and comparisons of politicians to mass murderers.

From the author's perspective, progressives may have adopted a strategy that goes beyond legislation to win a cultural crusade that delegitimizes their opponents and pushes for social change. The author notes that conservatives have marginalized themselves by aligning with Trump, and progressives are increasingly successful in silencing dissenting views on elite campuses and in workplaces. This cultural shift is redefining what is socially acceptable, potentially stigmatizing gun rights and ownership. The author warns that while progressives could win the culture war, using elite cultural intimidation rather than persuasion could lead to illiberalism and a significant political backlash. They caution that excluding a large portion of the country from ""respectable society"" could result in a reaction that makes the rise of Trump seem moderate."	0.0211	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text, richard cohen, is somewhat against affirmative action as it pertains to altering the merit-based admissions system of schools like stuyvesant high school.	"Summary:
Richard Cohen expresses concern over New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's view that Stuyvesant High School's majority Asian American student body represents a ""monumental injustice"" due to the underrepresentation of Hispanic and black students. Cohen highlights the merit-based admission system, which relies solely on entrance exam scores, as being fair and credits it with helping many poor Asian American students rise into the middle class. He questions the fairness of altering this system to favor other racial groups and criticizes de Blasio's proposal to eliminate the entrance exam in pursuit of greater racial diversity.

Author's Perspective:
The author, Richard Cohen, is critical of affirmative action policies that would disrupt the current merit-based admissions system at elite New York City high schools like Stuyvesant. Cohen's perspective is that the success of Asian American students, many of whom come from low-income families, is due to their hard work and dedication to studying. He views the system as fair and opposes changes that would potentially disadvantage these students based on their race or ethnicity. Cohen implies that the pursuit of racial balance should not come at the expense of those who have earned their place through effort, and he suggests that poverty is not always the main barrier to academic success, as demonstrated by the achievements of many poor Asian immigrants. He believes that Mayor de Blasio's plans to reserve slots for students who nearly pass the exam and to scrap the test entirely would undermine a system that embodies the American dream."	0.020280000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text appears to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, focusing instead on the strategic aspects of political campaigning and prioritization of issues for the democratic party.	"The text is an opinion piece discussing the strategy Democrats should adopt in response to President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee. The author suggests that Democrats should be realistic about the likelihood of the nominee's confirmation due to the Republican majority in the Senate. They should not lose hope, as historical precedent shows that political movements can rise from disadvantageous positions. The author encourages Democrats to focus on winning elections at all levels of government to counteract a conservative Supreme Court. Finally, the author advises Democrats to concentrate on issues where they have strong public support, such as health insurance, rather than more divisive social issues like abortion and affirmative action, especially in the context of the upcoming midterm elections.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action, along with other social issues, should not be the primary focus of Democrats during the midterm campaign. The author views these topics as potentially divisive and less advantageous for Democrats in terms of public opinion. Instead, the author believes that Democrats should leverage issues with broader public support to gain an edge in the midterms. The author implies that while social issues are important, they should not overshadow the strategic considerations necessary for Democrats to win elections and effectively challenge the conservative tilt of the Supreme Court. The discussion of affirmative action is situated within a broader argument about political priorities and the pragmatic choices that the Democratic Party faces in the current political climate."	0.020200000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt

- tom o'hare: neutral or somewhat against affirmative action, suggesting a preference for race-neutral policies.
- tom barnard: neutral, raising questions about the consistency of the administration's stance on diversity."	"The letters to the editor discuss the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize race in college admissions. The first letter highlights that prestigious colleges have historically given preference to legacies, athletes, donors, and those from underrepresented states, often benefiting white, economically advantaged students. It points out that affirmative action later shifted some advantages towards students of color and economically disadvantaged students to address biases and promote diversity. The author is critical of the current administration's targeting of affirmative action for black and brown students. The second letter suggests that President Trump's policy appeals to white resentment over minority ""privilege"" and proposes that affirmative action should also consider economic status to be less divisive. The third letter argues that treating African-Americans and Latinos as equals in college admissions and beyond is essential to recognizing their potential rather than condescending to them based on historical injustices. The final letter questions the administration's stance on gender diversity in admissions, noting that men are often admitted with lower scores than women to maintain gender balance, despite no history of discrimination against men in education.

The authors express varying perspectives on affirmative action, but they share a concern about the implications of the Trump administration's policies. Mallory Duncan defends the principle of affirmative action, emphasizing its role in correcting longstanding biases and promoting diversity. Michael Farzan criticizes the administration's approach as divisive and suggests that incorporating economic status into affirmative action could mitigate resentment. Tom O'Hare argues for equal treatment of all races, implying that affirmative action may be condescending. Tom Barnard questions the administration's selective concern for diversity, pointing out the inconsistency in accepting gender diversity while challenging racial diversity. Collectively, these authors suggest that affirmative action is a complex and nuanced issue that requires careful consideration of historical context, socioeconomic factors, and the goals of diversity and equality in education."	0.019510000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they commend wilson's early support for it but criticize his later efforts to eliminate such programs.	"The text is a sarcastic ""thank you"" note to former California Governor Pete Wilson on his 85th birthday, acknowledging his long career in public service, including his time as an assemblyman, mayor, U.S. senator, and governor. It highlights his moderate political approach early in his career, such as protecting wetlands, implementing affirmative-action hiring practices, and addressing racial injustices, including sponsoring legislation for Japanese American reparations. However, the author also criticizes Wilson's later actions, such as his role in deregulating California's electricity market, signing the three-strikes sentencing laws, working to eliminate affirmative action, and supporting Proposition 187, which targeted undocumented immigrants and those assisting them.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is complex and critical. Initially, they commend Wilson's early support for affirmative-action hiring practices, recognizing the importance of such measures in helping minorities overcome systemic disadvantages. However, the author sharply criticizes Wilson's later efforts to dismantle affirmative action programs at the University of California, suggesting that these actions not only reversed his earlier stance but also had a negative impact on minority communities. The author implies that Wilson's about-face on affirmative action radicalized college students and contributed to a retreat into ""the comforts of whiteness,"" indicating a belief that affirmative action was crucial for minority advancement into the middle class and that its removal was a significant setback."	0.021	affirmative action	txt/2090998076.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined based on the information provided. the text discusses the role of supreme court justices in interpreting the law and does not explicitly reveal the author's stance on affirmative action.	"In this text, Erwin Chemerinsky criticizes the comparison of Supreme Court justices to umpires, a simile used by both John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh during their confirmation hearings. Chemerinsky argues that, unlike umpires who apply rules with little interpretive leeway, Supreme Court justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law due to the Constitution's broad language. He points out that justices' decisions are influenced by their ideologies, as evidenced by differing opinions in cases such as District of Columbia vs. Heller, where the interpretation of the Second Amendment split the court along ideological lines. Chemerinsky also highlights that constitutional rights are not absolute and that determining what is ""reasonable"" or ""compelling"" often involves value judgments that cannot be solely derived from the text or original understanding of the Constitution.

Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, suggests that he views it as a matter requiring the justices to assess whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. This assessment involves making a value judgment rather than relying on the Constitution's text or its framers' intent. His broader argument implies that he believes the Supreme Court's role is not merely to apply the law but to interpret it in a manner that reflects the justices' own ideologies and life experiences. This perspective acknowledges the inherently subjective nature of constitutional interpretation, especially in cases where the law must be applied to contemporary issues that the framers could not have anticipated, such as affirmative action in college admissions."	0.02015	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt
	None	the author does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action; instead, they report on kavanaugh's perceived position and the concerns of progressives regarding his potential impact on affirmative action policies. the author's perspective on affirmative action itself cannot be determined from the provided summary.	"The Senate hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was highly partisan, with Democrats attempting to delay proceedings due to withheld documents and Republicans accusing them of grandstanding. Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, was expected to be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with only Republican support. The hearing was noted for revealing very little about the nominee's views, continuing a trend of decreasing transparency in the confirmation process. The contentious nature of recent hearings was contrasted with past confirmations, where nominees like Ruth Bader Ginsburg received overwhelming bipartisan support. Senators claim to seek neutral judges, yet their actions, such as blocking Obama nominee Merrick Garland, suggest otherwise. Kavanaugh's performance was seen as strong by conservatives, while liberals remained concerned about his stance on issues like abortion and civil rights.

From the author's perspective, there is a clear dissatisfaction with the current state of the judicial confirmation process, which has become increasingly partisan and less informative about the nominees' positions. The author highlights the contrast between Kavanaugh's public comments praising landmark civil rights decisions and his private memos criticizing affirmative action policies. This duality raises concerns among progressives about Kavanaugh's commitment to civil rights and his potential impact on future rulings regarding race-conscious measures. Kavanaugh's avoidance of direct answers on key issues like abortion and same-sex marriage further exacerbates fears that he may support overturning established precedents. The author implies that Kavanaugh's confirmation could lead to significant shifts in the Supreme Court's approach to contentious issues, with conservative activists potentially seeing his appointment as an opportunity to challenge and possibly reverse progressive legal gains."	0.028060000000000005	affirmative action	txt/2100741387.xml.txt
	None	the authors' perspectives on affirmative action are not the central focus of their letters, and their views on immigration policies do not directly translate to clear positions on affirmative action. therefore, it is not possible to categorize the authors' views on affirmative action based on the provided text, as they are primarily concerned with immigration and its political implications, rather than with affirmative action as a policy.	"The letters to the editor discuss Hillary Clinton's comments on European immigration policies. Pierre Bertrand, a former UNHCR director, is shocked by Clinton's statements and criticizes her for supporting policies that are harmful to refugees and migrants, despite her previous advocacy for human rights. Bertrand also references the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, highlighting the right to seek asylum. He contrasts Clinton's remarks with Angela Merkel's more welcoming stance towards Syrian refugees. Lorna Salzman praises Clinton for recognizing that mass migration has fueled right-wing populism in Europe, blaming the European left for ignoring cultural differences between Europeans and refugees. Salzman suggests that the left's inaction has led to the irreversible rise of the right. Jane Carey argues that immigration is not the root cause of the far-right's ascent but rather an excuse for their agenda. Carey insists that the focus should be on the West's interference in foreign conflicts and the urgent need to address climate change, which are the true drivers of immigration.

From the authors' perspectives, there is a clear concern about the political implications of immigration and the responses of various leaders. Bertrand seems to view affirmative action in the context of immigration as a moral imperative, applauding Merkel's approach and expressing disappointment with Clinton's position, which he sees as a departure from her human rights advocacy. Salzman, however, takes a pragmatic stance, suggesting that Clinton's acknowledgment of the political consequences of uncontrolled migration is necessary, even though it might seem to contradict the principles of affirmative action in terms of providing equal opportunities for refugees. Carey's perspective does not directly address affirmative action but implies a need for responsible and humane policies that address the root causes of migration, which could be seen as an indirect support for affirmative action by advocating for systemic solutions to global issues that force migration, rather than reactionary policies."	0.019590000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the protests in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where an estimated 55,000 people gathered to support race-based policies that favor the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese minority. These affirmative action policies in Malaysia, which began in the 1950s, were intended to help Malays economically and socially catch up with the ethnic Chinese. They include preferences in education, housing, government jobs, and business opportunities. Although supposed to end in 1991, these policies have been extended for political reasons. The author compares the situation in Malaysia to the affirmative action debate in the United States, mentioning controversies over race-based admissions in educational institutions like Harvard and New York City's top public high schools.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, both in Malaysia and the United States. They argue that such policies have not effectively closed the economic and educational gaps between racial groups and often benefit the already well-off within the advantaged groups, rather than the underprivileged. The author cites examples to suggest that affirmative action may exacerbate racial tensions and questions the practical effectiveness of these policies. They point out that the most significant improvements in the economic status of minority groups often occurred before the implementation of affirmative action and highlight instances, such as the University of California system's experience, where the discontinuation of race-based admissions led to better outcomes for minority students. The author implies that affirmative action policies may not be the best solution to address racial inequalities and may sometimes produce counterproductive results."	0.019470000000000005	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author's perspective on affirmative action, as conveyed through the portrayal of daniel patrick moynihan, is somewhat in favor.	"Summary:
The article reflects on the career of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former U.S. Senator and intellectual who recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Moynihan served under four presidents and was known for his deep historical knowledge and critical intelligence. Despite his intellectual prowess, Moynihan's legislative record was light on concrete results, and he was often perceived as a complex and contradictory figure. He was criticized for not being as effective a politician as he could have been, partly due to his temperament and personal issues. Moynihan had a strained relationship with the Clinton administration, particularly over welfare and health care reform. The article also touches on Moynihan's past, including his time in the Nixon administration and his controversial report on the black family. As he approaches retirement, Moynihan is seen as a symbol of a bygone era in the Senate, which has become more ideological and less deliberative.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jacob Weisberg, portrays Moynihan as a supporter of affirmative action, which he advocated following his controversial report on the black family in 1965. Moynihan's report highlighted the impact of family breakdown on the goal of racial equality and suggested policies to strengthen the black family, including affirmative action. However, the report was met with criticism from the left, who accused Moynihan of ""blaming the victim"" and racism. Despite this, Moynihan remained an advocate for policies that addressed racial disparities. Weisberg suggests that Moynihan's ideas on affirmative action and other social policies were shaped by his experiences and his understanding of the complex social dynamics at play. Moynihan's nuanced perspective on affirmative action reflects his broader approach to social policy, characterized by intellectual depth and a willingness to confront difficult issues, even at the cost of political controversy or personal criticism."	0.10988	affirmative action	txt/215497350.xml.txt
2	neutral	neutral	"The text provided discusses several instances where President Trump and others have been accused of amplifying divisive and discriminatory rhetoric. Trump has been criticized for his comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar's hijab and the late Sen. John McCain. The college admissions scandal has reignited debates over affirmative action, with some arguing the scandal underscores problems with how elite colleges select their students, while defenders of affirmative action point out that wealth plays a larger role in admissions than race. Sen. Amy Klobuchar criticized Trump for exacerbating racial and religious tensions, and Chris Wallace of Fox News acknowledged Trump's history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Additionally, an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker was mentioned for his reaction to being egged after making controversial comments about the New Zealand mosque shootings. Beto O'Rourke's acknowledgment of his white privilege was also highlighted, though it was suggested that he may be overlooking other diverse candidates.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that the college admissions scandal has brought the issue to the forefront, with both opponents and defenders of affirmative action weighing in. The author appears to suggest that the scandal has highlighted the influence of wealth in college admissions, potentially more so than race. This could be interpreted as a critique of the current admissions system, implying that it may not be as merit-based as it claims to be. The author also includes a quote from defenders of affirmative action, indicating that the presence of wealthy students at elite colleges is more prominent than that of minority students, which may suggest that the author believes affirmative action is still necessary to address these imbalances. However, without explicit commentary from the author, it is difficult to ascertain a definitive stance on affirmative action."	0.015880000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2193427873.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author seems somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its benefits for diversity but also acknowledging the stigma attached to it.	"The author, Carlotta Berry, an African-American woman and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, shares her experiences with titles and respect in academia. She emphasizes the importance of being addressed as ""Dr. Berry"" in the classroom, despite the casual norms of her white, male colleagues. Berry faces presumptions of being less qualified and feels that her legitimacy is undermined, in part due to the backlash against affirmative action policies. She encounters challenges such as having her expertise questioned, her lectures critiqued, and her authority dismissed. Despite these hurdles, Berry insists on professional interactions to command the respect often automatically given to her peers and to serve as a role model for women and black students in engineering.

Berry's perspective on affirmative action is that it has been vilified by its opponents, causing a stigma for those who might have benefited from it. She does not attribute her hiring to affirmative action but is aware of the perception that she and others like her are less qualified due to such policies. Berry understands the negative impact this has on the reputation of minority professionals. She highlights the low representation of African-American women in engineering academia and expresses her commitment to changing the face of engineering by being a visible and successful role model. Berry's insistence on being addressed by her title is not only for her own respect but also to inspire and encourage diversity within the engineering field."	0.019680000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2212953270.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the washington post editorial is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The New York Times editorial discusses a bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy aimed at reforming government surveillance practices. This bill seeks to end the mass collection of American telephone records, increase transparency regarding data collection by intelligence agencies, and establish a panel to advocate for privacy rights and civil liberties. It also mandates that the court issue public summaries of its decisions, emphasizing the impact on privacy and civil liberties. The editorial views this bill as a significant step in curbing the expansion of government surveillance power.

Regarding affirmative action, The Washington Post editorial supports the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policies. The author perceives affirmative action as a necessary and judicially acceptable practice for achieving diversity in education. The University of Texas complements its race-neutral ""top 10 percent program"" with a holistic review process that takes into account the race among other factors. The Post argues that such conscientiously designed programs should be affirmed by the Supreme Court, indicating the author's belief in the value of affirmative action as a tool for fostering diversity and equality in academic institutions."	0.017920000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2213159829.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the authors of the text are strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The letters to the editor address the topic of affirmative action and the ""mismatch"" theory, which suggests that affirmative action may harm minority students by placing them in schools where they may be unqualified. William Kidder, an assistant provost with published work on mismatch, argues that the bulk of peer-reviewed research does not support the mismatch hypothesis, citing evidence that minority students benefit from attending more selective universities. Rosiland Jordan contends that affirmative action remains necessary due to societal valuations of degrees from certain institutions and the systemic inequalities in education. Jane McAlevey believes that affirmative action should continue until a better solution to systemic racism is found and proven effective. Randal Maurice Jelks critiques the mismatch theory for its reliance on test scores, which he argues are not solely indicative of intellectual capabilities, and highlights the success of historically black colleges in educating black professionals.

From the authors' perspectives, there is a strong defense of affirmative action as a necessary and beneficial policy for addressing systemic inequalities and racism. Kidder emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence against the mismatch theory and highlights the positive outcomes for minority students in selective universities. Jordan critiques the broader social and educational systems that perpetuate inequality and argues for the continuation of affirmative action until fundamental changes are made. McAlevey frames affirmative action as a tool to counteract America's deep-rooted racism and insists on its expansion until an effective alternative is implemented. Jelks challenges the assumptions underpinning the mismatch theory and points to the success of historically black colleges as evidence that supportive institutional climates are crucial for student achievement. Collectively, these authors view affirmative action as a critical component in the pursuit of educational equity and social justice."	0.018430000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2215402698.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The author recounts a conversation with a Hollywood dealmaker who criticizes President Obama's negotiation tactics during the debt ceiling agreement, particularly his decision not to leverage the 14th Amendment as a bargaining chip against Republicans. The author reflects on the effectiveness of past presidents who combined intelligence and progressivism with a degree of cynicism and ruthlessness, citing F.D.R., Clinton, and surprisingly, Nixon. Nixon's administration is portrayed as more liberal than commonly remembered, with achievements including the creation of various federal agencies, affirmative action in federal hiring, and environmental and social welfare initiatives. The author notes the dissonance between Nixon's liberal policies and his conservative reputation, suggesting that the current GOP's extreme right-wing stance would be shocking even to Nixon.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action positively, as evidenced by the inclusion of Nixon's support for affirmative action in federal hiring as part of his liberal governance. This perspective is part of a broader argument that challenges the traditional view of Nixon as a conservative figure, highlighting his progressive actions which resonate with the author's apparent values. The author's mention of Nixon's expansion of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the initiation of affirmative action suggests an approval of such policies, which aligns with the author's frustration over Obama's nonconfrontational approach to politics and the desire for more assertive and visionary liberal leadership."	0.020479999999999998	affirmative action	txt/2216641847.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they express concern over the federalist society's potential influence on legal policy and the judiciary, which could undermine affirmative action and other progressive reforms.	"Lino Graglia, a conservative law professor, was visibly upset during the Federalist Society's 20th anniversary gala despite the organization's current influence and success. The society, known for its conservative legal stance, was celebrating its rise to power with members of the Bush administration, including Attorney General John Ashcroft, in attendance. However, Graglia and other conservatives expressed dissatisfaction with the administration's enforcement of antitrust laws and other policies they viewed as too liberal. The author also noted that the Federalist Society has been influential in setting legal policies and selecting judges, and that despite their victories, there was a sense of lingering resentment against past liberal opponents at the event.

The author's perspective on affirmative action can be inferred from the context of the piece. The author reminisces about their time on the Harvard Law Review, where conservative students, now members of the Federalist Society, complained about affirmative action and other liberal policies. This suggests that the author is aware of the long-standing conservative opposition to affirmative action. The tone of the article indicates the author's concern about the Federalist Society's potential to shape legal policy and the judiciary in a way that could undermine affirmative action and other progressive reforms. The author seems to advocate for vigilance from Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans to prevent a far-right shift in the courts that could jeopardize affirmative action and other mainstream principles."	0.02121	affirmative action	txt/2230209410.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author, michael teachout, appears to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, as his comments are focused more on the importance of a cohesive cabinet and the balance of power in government rather than on the policy of affirmative action itself.	"Michael Teachout criticizes a New York Times editorial for lamenting the lack of ideological diversity in President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet choices. Teachout points out the inconsistency in the newspaper's stance, noting that it never demanded President Clinton appoint cabinet members with conservative views on issues like abortion rights. He argues that Bush's cabinet does indeed include members with differing opinions, such as General Colin L. Powell on affirmative action and Governor Christie Whitman on abortion, but that these differences do not prevent them from aligning with Bush on key issues relevant to their appointed roles. Teachout emphasizes the importance of the president being able to work with his cabinet and the balance of power among the government's three branches.

From the letter, the author seems to have a pragmatic view on affirmative action and cabinet appointments. While Teachout does not directly state his own perspective on affirmative action, he acknowledges that General Colin L. Powell, a member of President-elect Bush's cabinet, supports affirmative action, which differs from some conservative viewpoints. Teachout appears to appreciate ideological diversity to a certain extent but prioritizes the functionality and coherence of the presidential cabinet. He suggests that the most important factor is that cabinet members share the president's vision for their specific roles, rather than holding identical beliefs on every issue. This perspective indicates that Teachout values effective governance and the ability of the executive branch to implement its agenda over strict ideological uniformity within the cabinet."	0.012470000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt
	None	the author does not express a direct stance on affirmative action itself but rather focuses on the political misuse of the issue. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be categorized based on the provided summary.	"The author criticizes the 106th Congress, particularly the Republican members, for their behavior and decisions, which they perceive as cynical and hypocritical. The author highlights instances such as the appointment of conferees who oppose a patient rights bill, the passing of a bill to increase profits for student loan companies, the overriding of state laws, and the addition of riders to appropriation bills that weaken environmental protections. The author is especially appalled by the Senate's rejection of Justice Ronnie White's nomination to a federal judgeship, which was influenced by Senator John Ashcroft's false accusations against White's character and judicial record.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be that it is a relevant and contentious issue, as evidenced by the case involving Justice Ronnie White's dissent. However, the author's main focus is not on affirmative action itself but on the misuse of the topic by Senator Ashcroft to discredit Justice White with false claims. The author suggests that Ashcroft's actions were politically motivated, aiming to appear tough on crime for re-election purposes. The author condemns the Senate's behavior, accusing them not of racism, but of tarnishing the confirmation process and unjustly damaging the reputation of a qualified and fair judge. The author believes the Senate's actions were driven by partisanship and pettiness rather than a genuine concern about affirmative action or Justice White's stance on it."	0.018510000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2234177127.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Piscataway, N.J., school board, which dismissed a white teacher in favor of a black teacher in 1989 to maintain diversity. The case was seen as a potential threat to affirmative-action laws, as the Supreme Court was expected to rule against the race-based layoff decision and possibly outlaw the consideration of race in employment. However, civil rights groups facilitated a settlement by paying a significant portion of the judgment awarded to the dismissed teacher, Sharon Taxman. This settlement prevented the Supreme Court from hearing the case, which many supporters of affirmative action viewed as a strategic move to protect affirmative-action practices.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be cautious but supportive. They recognize the importance of maintaining racial diversity and seem to appreciate the intentions behind affirmative action. However, the author also acknowledges the ""clumsy"" execution of such policies in the Piscataway case and suggests that the case was not an ideal one for the Supreme Court to use as a basis for a broader legal debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The author implies that while affirmative action is a noble goal, its application must be carefully considered to avoid legal complications and potential backlash that could threaten its existence."	0.01201	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The Clinton Administration changed its stance in a Supreme Court case involving affirmative action, disappointing its proponents but making a strategic decision to protect affirmative action's future. The case involves a New Jersey school board that chose to lay off a white teacher over a black teacher for the sake of racial diversity, which was initially supported by the Administration. However, the Administration's new brief admits the school board's actions violated the white teacher's civil rights, while also arguing for the preservation of affirmative action beyond just correcting past discrimination. The Administration suggests that there are times when considering race is necessary to achieve compelling public goals, such as in police recruitment or maintaining a diverse faculty in schools.

From the author's perspective, the Administration's approach is pragmatic, given the Supreme Court's recent rulings on racial preferences. The author seems to support affirmative action, arguing that it should not be limited to remedying past discrimination but can serve broader compelling interests, such as in law enforcement or education. The author criticizes the absolutist opponents of affirmative action and warns against a color-blind approach that ignores the reality of racial discrimination. They advocate for the need to consider race in public employment and judicial appointments to prevent discrimination and maintain public confidence. The author hopes the Supreme Court will recognize the importance of racial diversity for its own sake in the Piscataway case, suggesting that the legitimacy of the judiciary itself could be at stake without such recognition."	0.01913	affirmative action	txt/2236765173.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author, timothy r. cahn, is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Timothy R. Cahn writes to the editor to express his view on affirmative action, responding to an Op-Ed piece by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence. He argues that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admissions based on race, then the lack of proportional racial representation at universities must be due to non-merit-based factors. Cahn suggests that affirmative action is necessary not just to address overt discrimination, as Matsuda and Lawrence propose, but also to correct an admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect the racial diversity of society.

The author, Timothy R. Cahn, appears to support the concept of affirmative action but from a slightly different perspective than that of Matsuda and Lawrence. While Matsuda and Lawrence focus on its role in counteracting direct discrimination, Cahn emphasizes the importance of affirmative action in adjusting an admissions system that inadvertently leads to racially unrepresentative university cohorts. He implies that affirmative action is a tool for ensuring that the student body mirrors the racial composition of the broader society, thereby suggesting that diversity in education is a value that should be actively pursued to correct systemic imbalances. Cahn's stance indicates a belief in the inherent fairness of aiming for racial proportionality in academic institutions as a reflection of societal diversity."	0.010660000000000001	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text, evan edwards, is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The letter to the editor, written by Evan Edwards, is a response to Frank Rich's column ""Angry White Woman"" and criticizes Tanya Melich for leaving the Republican Party. Edwards argues that the Republican Party in New York City, especially in Manhattan, is known to be liberal or ultra-liberal, citing the formation of the New York State Conservative Party as evidence of this. He also defends the Republican Party's inclusiveness by mentioning that the 1992 Republican convention allowed AIDS activist Mary Fisher to speak, contrasting with the Democratic Party's exclusion of Gov. Robert P. Casey's anti-abortion stance. Edwards highlights the Republican Party's history of appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court and having women in significant roles during the Reagan and Bush administrations. He contends that the Republican Party is for moderates to conservatives and that being against affirmative action or welfare dependency does not equate to being anti-women. Edwards concludes by suggesting that Melich is more aligned with the Democratic Party, particularly with figures like Ruth Messinger.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is viewed as a policy that may not align with the core beliefs of the Republican Party. Edwards appears to believe that opposition to affirmative action is a stance that does not inherently oppose women's interests. He suggests that the Republican Party's principles and policies are designed to support a moderate to conservative agenda, which can include women's advancement without necessarily endorsing affirmative action. Edwards's mention of the Republican Party's historical inclusivity of women in high positions indicates that he sees the party as supportive of women's progress through means other than affirmative action, aligning with a conservative viewpoint that values merit and individual achievement over mandated diversity programs."	0.014850000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses a hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties regarding H.R. 40, a bill that would explore reparations for slavery and its continuing impacts on the black community in America. The hearing, which took place on Juneteenth, included testimony from members of the black community, including Ta-Nehisi Coates, who emphasized the historical atrocities of slavery. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opposed reparations, arguing that civil rights legislation and the election of President Barack Obama were efforts to address the legacy of slavery, and that it would be difficult to determine who should be compensated. The author highlights ongoing issues such as housing discrimination, police violence, wage gaps, health care inequities, and environmental hazards like the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, as evidence of the lasting effects of slavery and systemic racism. They advocate for reparations and a national acknowledgment of the wrongs done to the black community.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is still a necessary measure to address the enduring inequalities faced by the black community. The author is critical of those who dismiss the need for affirmative action, pointing to the persistent wage gaps, workplace representation issues, and health care disparities as indicators that the fight against systemic racism is far from over. They also mention the skepticism and excuses made by others to downplay the importance of support and protection for the black community. The author argues that the legacy of racism continues to be perpetuated by actions such as gerrymandering and racial profiling, and that the refusal to acknowledge the full scope of the black American experience, including the ongoing effects of slavery, is unacceptable. They call for a genuine effort to rectify the historical and continuing damage caused by slavery, including economic reparations, and express a desire to witness a national awakening and apology for the harm caused. The author invokes the imagery of Moses parting the waters, suggesting that it is time for America to confront and address its racial injustices head-on."	0.022940000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2244665351.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author, moises velasquez-manoff, appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as he positively discusses diversity and measures to foster interracial unity, which are in line with the principles of affirmative action.	"**Summary:**
The text recounts the experiences of Dr. Kristin Pauker, a mixed-race psychology professor from Hawaii, and her research on how race is perceived differently in Hawaii compared to the mainland U.S. In Hawaii, a place with a high percentage of mixed-race individuals, race is seen as a fluid concept rather than a fixed biological trait. Dr. Pauker's studies suggest that Hawaii's unique racial dynamics could offer insights into reducing essentialist thinking and racism. The author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, a writer of mixed heritage, explores the historical and social factors that contribute to Hawaii's distinct approach to race, including its labor history and the ""aloha spirit."" He suggests that Hawaii's example demonstrates that fostering a collective identity and emphasizing mutual respect can lead to more harmonious race relations.

**Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:**
While the author, Moises Velasquez-Manoff, does not directly discuss affirmative action, his exploration of race dynamics in Hawaii implies a supportive view of efforts to increase diversity and inclusivity. He highlights the benefits of diversity, such as improved problem-solving and creativity, and notes the historical success of deliberate measures to foster interracial unity, such as the intentional distribution of leadership positions among ethnic groups during union organizing. Velasquez-Manoff's interest in how Hawaii's racial harmony was achieved suggests that he might view affirmative action as a potential tool for creating more equitable and less racially divided societies. His focus on the positive outcomes of Hawaii's approach to race relations indicates a belief in proactive measures to dismantle racial barriers and encourage diversity, which aligns with the goals of affirmative action policies."	0.07978	affirmative action	txt/2248215580.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the third letter, harry piotrowski, is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The provided text contains three separate letters to the editor, each touching on different aspects of Supreme Court justice selection and the concept of ""ordinary Americans."" Robert B. Newlin suggests that President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court justice who is an ordinary person, someone who can relate to the experiences of the general populace, such as a business executive, health-care professional, educator, or military leader. Richard L. Sheffield criticizes the use of the term ""ordinary"" when describing Americans, arguing that it carries connotations of inferiority and suggests finding an alternative term that does not imply a hierarchy among citizens. Harry Piotrowski points out the irony in Ronald Reagan's appointment of Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court based on ethnic representation, given that both Reagan and Scalia were critics of affirmative action, which they saw as contrary to a merit-based society.

The author of the third letter, Harry Piotrowski, expresses a critical view of affirmative action. He highlights the irony of former President Ronald Reagan appointing Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court because of his ""Italian extraction,"" despite their shared view of affirmative action as detrimental to a merit-based society. Piotrowski implies that Reagan's decision was influenced by a form of affirmative action, which contradicts the public stance both men took against such policies. He suggests that Scalia believed he deserved his position on merit alone, without acknowledging the potential influence of his ethnic background on Reagan's decision. This perspective underscores the complexities and contradictions that can arise in discussions about affirmative action and representation."	0.015090000000000001	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be somewhat in favor.	"The text discusses a series of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on the DACA case involving nearly 700,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers. The Court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled 5 to 4 to invalidate the Trump administration's termination of DACA, stating that the administration's rationale was inadequate and thus ""arbitrary and capricious."" The decision emphasized the importance of considering the reliance interests of those affected by DACA, including Dreamers, their families, employers, and state and local governments. The author reflects on the unpredictability of the Supreme Court's decisions, citing past rulings on affirmative action, LGBTQ rights, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, and suggests that the Court often realigns itself with public sentiment.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be positive, highlighting a historical moment when the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action in higher education during the 2002-2003 term. This is mentioned in the context of the Court's tendency to adapt to societal expectations and demands. The author seems to appreciate the Court's role in facilitating social change and protecting individual rights, as evidenced by the mention of the Court's decision not to obstruct the progress of LGBTQ rights. The reference to affirmative action, along with other landmark decisions, serves to illustrate the Court's capacity for surprising shifts and the influence of the broader social and political climate on its rulings."	0.02671	affirmative action	txt/2414754878.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text, jennifer lee, is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the debate surrounding Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5) in California, which proposes to repeal Proposition 209 and thereby restore affirmative action in public employment, contracting, and education. Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action in 1996, is criticized for not having increased Asian American admissions to the University of California system and for failing to address the career ceilings and blocked mobility that Asian Americans face in employment. The author argues that affirmative action is necessary to combat systemic discrimination and the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in leadership positions across various sectors. The text also notes the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic and points out that a majority of Asian American voters support affirmative action, with U.S.-born and third-generation or higher Asian Americans being more likely to favor it than recent immigrants.

The author, Jennifer Lee, appears to be a proponent of affirmative action, emphasizing its importance in addressing systemic inequalities and promoting diversity in higher education and the workforce. She challenges the misconception that affirmative action would lead to racial quotas, which have been unconstitutional since 1978, and presents evidence that Proposition 209 did not benefit Asian Americans in university admissions. Lee also highlights the barriers that Asian Americans face in professional advancement, despite being well-represented in student populations at elite universities. She points to data showing that a significant majority of Asian American voters, especially those born in the U.S., support affirmative action. Lee's perspective is that affirmative action policies are crucial for creating a more equitable society and that Asian Americans should advocate for these policies to benefit all marginalized groups. Her stance is that anti-affirmative action laws like Proposition 209 perpetuate historic discrimination rather than leveling the playing field."	0.020950000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2417314051.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice (DOJ), highlighting its origins post-Civil War to replace expensive private attorneys with full-time professionals and to enforce civil rights statutes for African Americans. However, the author expresses disappointment with the DOJ's direction under the Trump administration and Attorney General William P. Barr, criticizing instances of perceived partisanship, interference in policy and personnel decisions, leniency towards political allies, and a lackluster approach to civil rights, particularly in matters of affirmative action and police conduct. The author acknowledges that some level of partisanship is inevitable but suggests that reducing the scope of federal criminal law could mitigate the risk of politicized law enforcement.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Trump administration's stance. They imply that the administration, particularly under Barr, has not been supportive of affirmative action, referencing the DOJ's support for lawsuits challenging affirmative action in college admissions. The author seems to view affirmative action as a component of the DOJ's civil rights mission, suggesting that a failure to aggressively defend or enforce it is a departure from the department's responsibilities. The call for a rededication to the DOJ's founding principles of professionalism and impartiality, with a focus on civil rights, indicates that the author believes affirmative action should be part of the DOJ's agenda in protecting civil rights and ensuring equal opportunity."	0.01593	affirmative action	txt/2419240626.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the systemic racism in American society, highlighted by the murder of George Floyd and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans. It criticizes President Donald Trump for using racism as a political strategy, noting that his approach echoes that of former President Ronald Reagan. The author points out that while Trump is often condemned by some Republicans, Reagan's record on race and civil rights is frequently defended, despite evidence of his racist remarks and policies. Reagan's use of racially coded language and his actions, such as the speech at the Neshoba County Fair near the site of a notorious civil rights murder and his opposition to civil rights legislation, are cited as examples of his racially divisive politics. The author also mentions Reagan's role in the 'war on drugs' which disproportionately affected Black and poor communities. 

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of Reagan's efforts to abolish it, framing it as part of a broader attack on civil rights advances. The author argues that Reagan's presidency marked a low point in race relations, as his administration sought to weaken the Voting Rights Act and end affirmative action by portraying white men as victims of reverse discrimination. This stance on affirmative action is part of a larger narrative that connects Reagan's racially charged policies and rhetoric to the political climate that eventually allowed Trump to rise to power. The author suggests that Reagan's racism was particularly insidious because it was masked by a genial public persona, which made it more acceptable to some voters. The implication is that to understand and address Trump's racism, one must also confront the legacy of Reagan, especially his tactics of appealing to white voters through subtle and not-so-subtle racist appeals."	0.024950000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2424705741.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text seems to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, focusing instead on the merits and contributions of black women to politics, rather than attributing their successes to affirmative action policies.	"The text highlights the significant role Black women have played in shaping the political landscape, particularly within the Democratic Party. It emphasizes that Senator Kamala Harris's selection as Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate in the 2020 election is not merely a token gesture or affirmative action pick, but rather the culmination of years of political labor by Black women. The author notes the high voter turnout rates and loyalty of Black women to the Democratic Party, and points out that this demographic has been key in recent elections. The text also acknowledges the grassroots efforts by Black women to register and mobilize voters, and the establishment of organizations aimed at empowering Black women to run for office and exert political influence. The author reflects on the long history of Black women's fight for voting rights and their consistent advocacy for universal rights, despite experiencing both racism and sexism.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it should not be used to diminish the accomplishments and qualifications of individuals like Kamala Harris. The author argues that Harris's selection is a recognition of the political power and influence of Black women, who have been integral in the Democratic Party's successes, rather than a result of affirmative action. The text suggests that Black women have earned their place in politics through sheer effort and dedication, and that their support and work for the party have been crucial, often without significant investment or acknowledgment from the party itself. The author views Harris's nomination as a milestone in the ongoing struggle for political representation and influence by Black women, and a testament to their role as essential architects of political change rather than beneficiaries of affirmative action."	0.02096	affirmative action	txt/2432777796.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text is a personal reflection on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's influence on the author, who was inspired by Ginsburg's commitment to civil rights and gender equality. The author recounts attending a conference in the 1970s where Ginsburg spoke, leaving a lasting impression. Ginsburg's approach to equality was progressive, advocating for both men and women to be free from gender-based stereotypes. Her Supreme Court advocacy record was notable, arguing six cases and winning five. Ginsburg was seen as a judicial-restraint liberal who valued incremental legal change and respected the role of courts within a constitutional democracy. She emphasized the importance of understanding legal rules within their social and historical context and was known for her detailed analysis in opinions, such as the decision to admit women to the Virginia Military Institute and her stance on affirmative action. The author also mentions Ginsburg's dissenting opinions on key issues like the Voting Rights Act and women's reproductive rights.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is informed by Ginsburg's judicial philosophy and decisions. Ginsburg recognized the persistence of racial inequity and was sympathetic to affirmative action programs as a means to address systemic discrimination. She would meticulously detail the historical and social contexts of cases, highlighting the need for affirmative action to combat long-standing inequalities. The author appears to share Ginsburg's view that affirmative action is necessary to rectify the lingering effects of centuries of sanctioned inequality and to foster a more equitable society. Ginsburg's methodical approach to cases involving affirmative action reflects her broader commitment to civil rights and the author's admiration for Ginsburg's legal reasoning and impact on the judiciary."	0.02157	affirmative action	txt/2444131672.xml.txt
2	neutral	neutral	"The text discusses the decision not to charge police officers for the killing of Breonna Taylor, expressing frustration and disappointment at the justice system. The Kentucky Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, charged one officer with wanton endangerment for firing into neighboring apartments, but not for Taylor's death. The author criticizes Cameron's reference to ""mob justice,"" drawing parallels to historical racial violence in the South where Black people were often victims of lynchings and terror tactics, sometimes with the complicity of the criminal justice system. The author argues that the protesters are not a mob but individuals seeking justice and respect, emphasizing the systemic failure to hold police accountable for violence against Black citizens. The piece reflects on the broader impact of such incidents on the African-American community, including distrust in government and the emotional toll of repeated injustices.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred through a brief mention of how Black individuals often become aware of their racial identity through negative experiences, including racial prejudice and misconceptions about affirmative action. The author notes that stories of realizing one's Blackness frequently involve incidents where racial prejudice surfaces, such as a teacher suggesting that affirmative action rather than merit would secure college admission. This indicates the author's awareness of the complexities and stigmas surrounding affirmative action policies, which aim to address historical inequalities but can also perpetuate certain stereotypes and misunderstandings about the qualifications and achievements of Black individuals. The mention of affirmative action in the context of broader discussions on racism suggests the author sees it as a necessary but sometimes controversial tool in the struggle for racial equality."	0.022590000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2445858352.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text is an opinion piece by a former Yale student-body president who argues that Yale University has not done enough to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. The author highlights the slow progress that has been made, such as the renaming of a building previously dedicated to a slavery advocate and the granting of limited hiring power to the ethnic studies department. The author also points out the stark lack of diversity among Yale's faculty and emphasizes the importance of diversity for both the campus and future leaders. The piece criticizes the Trump administration's lawsuit against Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian American and White applicants in admissions, suggesting that the lawsuit is an attempt to roll back affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies that help maintain diversity at elite institutions.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive and defensive, seeing it as a crucial tool for achieving equity and diversity in higher education. They view the Trump administration's actions as a direct threat to the progress that has been made in diversifying college campuses. The author cites the potential negative impact that ending race-conscious admissions could have on the representation of African American and Hispanic students, referencing a similar case against Harvard. They also mention the systemic disadvantages faced by students of color in segregated and under-resourced schools, implying that affirmative action is a necessary response to these inequities. The author is committed to defending Yale's admissions policies and believes that the lawsuit aims to undermine efforts to create a more equitable educational environment. The text concludes with a personal reflection on the significance of the author's own role as the first Black student-body president at Yale, and a call to action to resist efforts that would hinder the advancement of underrepresented students."	0.02106	affirmative action	txt/2452692303.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text is a critique of Donald Trump's claims that he has done more for the Black community than any other president since Abraham Lincoln. The author expresses outrage at Trump's suggestion that Black people should be grateful for his actions and compares his rhetoric to that of a slave master asserting benevolence towards slaves. The author is also critical of Jared Kushner's comments implying that Black people do not want to be successful, labeling them as an extension of Trump's patronizing and racist attitudes. The hypocrisy of both Trump and Kushner is highlighted, given their inherited wealth and ignorance of the systemic barriers faced by African Americans. The author refutes Trump's claims by citing statistics showing that the economic standing of African Americans was improving before Trump took office, and emphasizes that African Americans have historically achieved success without Trump's intervention.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is one of support, seeing it as a necessary measure to bridge economic disparities. They view the achievements of the Black community despite historical disadvantages as impressive and note that systems like affirmative action have been essential in fighting for economic parity. The author criticizes the Trump administration for overlooking the importance of such programs and for attempting to dismantle these equalizers. The implication is that affirmative action is a valuable tool in addressing systemic inequalities and that its erosion by those in power is a significant setback for achieving racial and economic justice."	0.01931	affirmative action	txt/2454579785.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	richard rodriguez is strongly against affirmative action.	"Summary:

In ""On the Contrary,"" Mary McCarthy's essays from 1946 to 1961 critique a range of topics, including politics, literature, and fashion, with sharp wit and contrarian views. She reflects on her liberal anti-communist stance in ""My Confession."" Leonard Michaels' posthumous essay collection in ""The Essays of Leonard Michaels"" reveals his personal experiences and intellectual insights, with a blend of humor and darkness. Vladimir Nabokov's ""Speak, Memory"" offers a series of autobiographical essays that recall his aristocratic childhood in Russia and his later years of exile. Richard Rodriguez's ""Hunger of Memory"" explores his opposition to bilingual education and affirmative action, discussing the cultural and educational transformation he experienced as a ""scholarship boy."" Finally, Susan Sontag's ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" contains cultural critiques and tributes to intellectual figures, showcasing a more personal and warm approach compared to her earlier works.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:

Richard Rodriguez's perspective on affirmative action, as presented in ""Hunger of Memory,"" is complex and personal. He opposes affirmative action, finding that his own educational and cultural journey illustrates the trade-offs between intimate familial connections and the public identity shaped by formal education. Rodriguez's stance is rooted in his experience of growing up in a working-class, Spanish-speaking household and transitioning into an English-speaking academic world. He suggests that the gains from this shift, although painful, were necessary for his success. His nuanced argument reflects a deep understanding of the cultural and linguistic challenges faced by minority students, while also revealing the sense of loss and alienation that can accompany assimilation into the mainstream. Rodriguez's writing conveys a sense of moral conviction and self-awareness, as he grapples with the implications of his views on affirmative action and the broader cultural dynamics at play."	0.02561	affirmative action	txt/2469478152.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against affirmative action as implemented in the marin county ubi program.	"The provided text outlines a universal basic income (UBI) experiment in Marin County, California, where 125 low-income residents will receive $1,000 monthly starting in May, funded in part by the Marin Community Foundation and the county board. Unlike a similar program in Stockton, the Marin initiative specifically targets ""mothers of color,"" excluding fathers and white mothers. The author, who grew up poor with a white mother in similar circumstances, questions the legality and fairness of using public funds for a racially and sexually discriminatory program, citing California's strict scrutiny standards for racial and sex classifications in affirmative action programs.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as exemplified by the Marin County UBI program, is critical and concerned with issues of racial justice and legality. He argues that excluding individuals based on race or sex, even with the intent of helping disadvantaged groups, constitutes racial injustice and violates equal protection clauses. The author shares his personal experience to highlight the potential unfairness in the program's design, as his white mother, who faced similar hardships and discrimination as the targeted demographic, would have been ineligible for assistance. He warns that well-intended policies like UBI could be compromised by perceptions of racism and might deepen social divisions, rather than addressing poverty effectively. Mr. Westhill's role as president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity further underscores his commitment to scrutinizing affirmative action policies from a legal and ethical standpoint."	0.01625	affirmative action	txt/2509403436.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author is somewhat against affirmative action as it is currently applied in elite educational institutions, criticizing it for reinforcing existing inequalities rather than addressing systemic issues.	"The author reflects on the media's focus on police violence against Black Americans, particularly since George Floyd's murder, while pointing out that other systemic inequities have not received as much attention. They highlight that these inequities, such as disparities in life expectancy and education, can be more deadly and widespread. The author criticizes the public education system, which is funded locally, leading to a segregation where wealthy, often white students attend better-funded schools, while poorer, often nonwhite students attend underfunded schools. The piece also mentions the failure of the Supreme Court to address this inequality in school funding in the past and notes how affluent white Americans benefit from systems that perpetuate racial and economic segregation.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is seen critically when it comes to its application in elite educational institutions. They suggest that legacy admissions at universities serve as a form of affirmative action for the privileged, predominantly benefiting wealthy, white families. The author also notes that these same families benefit from zoning laws that maintain segregated, affluent neighborhoods linked to high-quality ""public"" schools. This perspective implies a critique of how affirmative action, in this context, reinforces existing inequalities rather than addressing them. The author advocates for policy measures that aim to reduce gaps in opportunity and wealth, such as early childhood programs and job training, to address root inequities. However, they point out the paradox that framing these measures as ways to reduce racial inequality can decrease public support, suggesting that advocating for them as class-equality initiatives may be more effective."	0.032200000000000006	affirmative action	txt/2530287535.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text provided discusses the potential consequences for California's values if Governor Gavin Newsom is recalled. The author highlights that the values at risk include the protection of natural resources, diversity, tolerance, equality, embracing democracy, and support for the marginalized. They argue that Newsom's leadership has advanced these values by implementing policies that protect the environment, promote equality, and expand democratic participation. The leading Republican candidates, particularly Larry Elder, are portrayed as not supporting these values, with concerns that they may reverse the progress made in areas such as climate and environmental goals, criminal justice reform, and voting rights.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive of efforts to ensure equality and reverse discriminatory policies. They acknowledge California's history of discrimination, including actions against immigrant rights and affirmative action. However, they commend the state's progress under Newsom's leadership, such as supporting a panel to examine reparations for descendants of enslaved people. The author fears that the progress made towards fighting intolerance and discrimination, including efforts in affirmative action, could be undone if Newsom is recalled and replaced by a Republican candidate who denies the existence of racial discrimination and inequality. The text suggests that the author believes in the importance of affirmative action as part of California's commitment to diversity, tolerance, and equality."	0.01999	affirmative action	txt/2565796466.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they suggest it is part of a set of policies that may alienate broader voter groups and could be politically detrimental to democrats.	"Summary:
The text discusses the perceived left-wing bias in the media and its impact on Democratic politics. The author refers to a column by Ezra Klein about David Shor, a progressive analyst who believes the left's focus on issues important to its youthful, educated base, such as climate change, immigration, and affirmative action, may alienate broader voter groups. Shor suggests Democrats should prioritize popular ideas to gain and maintain power. However, the media's leftward tilt and the echo chamber it creates may make it challenging for Democrats to shift away from identity politics. The media, sustained by a like-minded subscriber base, may not feel the need to change, but Democrats cannot afford to ignore the broader electorate's preferences. Shor warns that the media's alignment with the left could lead to an electoral disaster if Democrats don't adapt their messaging to appeal to a wider audience.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of affirmative action, indicating that it is one of the issues championed by the left that may not resonate with the intended beneficiaries, such as voters of color. The author suggests that the focus on such issues could be politically detrimental to Democrats, as it may paint them as out of touch with the average voter's concerns. The text implies that affirmative action is part of a suite of progressive policies that, while popular within a certain activist and media bubble, might not have broad appeal. The author seems to align with Shor's pragmatic approach, which calls for Democrats to find common ground with the electorate rather than pushing policies that are exciting to a narrow base but potentially alienating to others. This perspective reflects a concern that the media's embrace of certain progressive policies, including affirmative action, could contribute to political missteps and electoral losses for Democrats."	0.022810000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2582284660.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against affirmative action as it is currently interpreted and practiced.	"The author of the text expresses deep dissatisfaction with the current state of both major political parties in the United States. Initially a registered Democrat, the author later became an independent while working as a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe. Despite leaning towards Democratic values in most elections, the author feels alienated by the increasing tribalism in party politics and is repulsed by the extremism in both parties. They criticize the Republican Party for its Trumpist tendencies that threaten the republic's foundations and the Democratic Party for abandoning traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, favoring a divisive focus on identity politics. The author is disillusioned with the political system and predicts the rise of an independent presidential candidate or a reformist Democratic figure to fill the current political void.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action as initially conceptualized under Lyndon B. Johnson was sensible, aiming to correct historical discrimination and promote equality. However, the author strongly disagrees with the contemporary radical interpretation of affirmative action, particularly as advocated by Ibram X. Kendi, who suggests that discrimination should be used as a remedy for past and present injustices. The author views this approach as a call for social upheaval akin to post-colonial transitions, which they believe does not end well. They also criticize the current political climate for its intolerance of civil debate and the imposition of rigid language controls. The author advocates for a return to true equality and liberalism, where individuals are not reduced to mere demographic categories, and the shared values and laws that define American identity are upheld."	0.029060000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2628908360.xml.txt
	None	"the author of the text does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action itself but rather is concerned with the broader implications of labeling certain viewpoints as hate speech, which could potentially include opposition to affirmative action. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided summary. the categorization would be ""not concerned with affirmative action"" based on the information given."	"The text criticizes the conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's murderers for hate crimes, suggesting that it is a form of punishment for their racist thoughts, which is seen as a step towards totalitarianism. The author argues that while the murderers' actions were undoubtedly racist and worthy of punishment, the additional federal conviction for hate crimes is unnecessary and potentially unconstitutional. It is pointed out that the murderers had already been sentenced to life imprisonment by a state court for the murder itself, and the federal conviction is seen as a symbolic gesture to condemn their racism. The author is concerned about the implications of punishing individuals for their beliefs, as it could lead to a slippery slope where the government starts policing thoughts and speech, which is protected by the First Amendment.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is one of the ideas that could be labeled as ""hate speech"" under the expanding definition used by some institutions and governments. The author implies that opposition to race-based affirmative action could be unjustly categorized as hate speech, which could stifle legitimate debate and dissenting opinions. The text suggests that the European Court of Human Rights' stance on preventing expressions that justify hatred could lead to preemptive censorship, which the author views as a dangerous overreach. The author seems to advocate for robust constitutional protections to prevent what they view as the encroachment on free speech and thought, as seen in the context of hate crime legislation and the policing of speech in academic settings. Overall, the author is wary of government overreach and the potential for punitive actions against individuals based on their beliefs or expressions, especially when those beliefs pertain to contentious issues like affirmative action."	0.02207	affirmative action	txt/2633115690.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's transformation of perspective regarding affirmative action and federalism over her tenure on the Supreme Court, influenced in part by Justice Thurgood Marshall. Initially, O'Connor was known for opposing affirmative action and favoring states' rights, but by her retirement in 2006, she had authored the majority opinion preserving affirmative action in university admissions. The author also reflects on the potential impact of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, emphasizing her background as a public defender, public school graduate, and her other diverse characteristics beyond just race.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be appreciative of its role and the evolution of Justice O'Connor's stance on the matter. They highlight the importance of personal growth and the potential for individuals, such as O'Connor, to be influenced by the experiences and stories of others, like Marshall. The author also seems to support the idea that a justice's background and experiences, including those related to race, can contribute to a richer, more diverse perspective on the Supreme Court. This is evident in the discussion of Judge Jackson's qualifications and the broader context of diversity she would bring to the Court, suggesting that her presence might inspire her colleagues to reconsider their own views on affirmative action and other issues."	0.040400000000000005	affirmative action	txt/2635873593.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	based on the summary, the author david bernstein seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as he is critical of ideological approaches to teaching race and racism and advocates for a balanced educational approach that includes multiple viewpoints.	"The author, David Bernstein, argues against the polarized perspectives on teaching race and racism in American schools. He criticizes the right's efforts to ban critical race theory (CRT) and certain books, as well as the left's approach to teaching about systemic racism without room for debate, denying that CRT is being taught. Bernstein advocates for a balanced educational approach that includes teaching about America's racist history while upholding liberal values of free inquiry and exposing students to multiple viewpoints.

Bernstein, drawing from personal experiences with his children's education in Maryland, describes the current instruction as overly ideological and prescriptive, lacking in critical thinking and debate. He notes that his son is frustrated with being told exactly what to think about social issues, including race, and that alternative perspectives are not welcomed. Bernstein is concerned that the education system is presenting opinions as facts and not allowing for discussion on the complexity of racism in America. He calls for a more nuanced approach that includes a variety of scholarly opinions and encourages students to think critically and form their own views. Bernstein's perspective on affirmative action, though not explicitly stated, suggests he would support teaching about it as part of a broader discussion on race and inequality, provided it is done within a framework that allows for multiple narratives and critical analysis."	0.022890000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2648708177.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
The provided text consists of opinions from different individuals reacting to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Linda Linton expresses concern about the potential erosion of various civil rights, including affirmative action and LGBTQ rights, fearing that the U.S. may no longer feel like her country. Michael D. Abell suggests that the decision signifies the South winning the Civil War ideologically by shifting civil rights control to the states, and he fears this will lead to a rollback of civil rights to a pre-Brown v. Board of Education era. George Miller warns that Title IX could be at risk due to the Court's rationale in the Roe v. Wade decision, as it lacks ""deep roots"" in history, and urges preparation to defend it. Julie Thostenson takes a different stance, arguing that pregnancy is a result of personal action and responsibility, and that people should practice body autonomy and use birth control if they do not wish to have children.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action, although not explicitly stated, can be inferred from the broader context of their concerns about the Supreme Court's recent actions. The author appears to be worried about the future of affirmative action policies in the wake of the Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, as it signals a potential shift towards allowing states to have more control over civil rights issues. Given the anxiety expressed about the rollback of various rights and protections, it is likely that the author views affirmative action as a critical measure for ensuring equal opportunities and fears that it may be under threat. The author's concern suggests a belief in the importance of affirmative action as a safeguard against discrimination and a means to promote social equity, aligning with a perspective that values such policies as essential for a fair and just society."	0.02033	affirmative action	txt/2682983998.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is neutral. they present multiple viewpoints without taking a definitive stance in favor or against affirmative action.	"The Supreme Court is set to hear challenges to affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, revisiting the issue more than four decades after its initial ruling that allowed for racial considerations in higher education. Despite affirmative action being banned in nine states, public opinion remains divided, with a significant majority of Americans opposing race-based considerations in college admissions. Yale Law Professor Justin Driver suggests a middle path that would allow institutions time to transition to race-neutral admissions, referencing a 25-year timeframe mentioned by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision. Linda Greenhouse and Renu Mukherjee also contribute essays that reflect on the implications of these cases for the future of higher education and the Supreme Court.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is multifaceted and includes various viewpoints. Justin Driver appears to support a gradual phasing out of affirmative action, proposing a transition period for institutions to adapt to race-neutral policies. Linda Greenhouse frames the debate as a continuation of the struggle to define the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, suggesting that the very concept of diversity in education is being reconsidered. Renu Mukherjee, on the other hand, questions the effectiveness of affirmative action in achieving true campus diversity and advocates for race-neutral alternatives, drawing on her personal experience to argue for recognition of a broader spectrum of diversity. These essays collectively suggest that while affirmative action has played a significant role in shaping higher education, its future is uncertain, and there are differing opinions on the best path forward to achieve diversity and equality in college admissions."	0.02357	affirmative action	txt/2730261179.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the authors of the text are somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
Chief Justice John Roberts' 2022 ""year-end report on the federal judiciary"" is notable for its omissions, including any mention of substantive reforms or pressing issues such as the lack of recusal requirements, the leak of the abortion rights decision draft, and financial disclosure concerns. Instead, Roberts highlighted the dangers faced by judges, referencing the 1957 desegregation efforts and thanking Congress for a new law protecting judges' personal information. The report's appendix reveals a decline in federal court use, with civil case filings significantly reduced. The authors suggest that this decline is partly due to the Supreme Court's decisions limiting access to the courts, such as favoring arbitration over litigation, which has discouraged potential litigants. However, a notable exception is the group litigation of veterans against 3M over faulty earplugs, made possible by the absence of an arbitration mandate.

Author's Perspective:
The authors, Nancy Gertner and Judith Resnik, provide a critical perspective on affirmative action and the Supreme Court's role in federal court accessibility. They express concern that the Supreme Court appears ready to reverse decisions upholding affirmative action, a remedy stemming from the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which the court historically supported. The authors imply that the current Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, has strayed from its legacy of protecting civil rights and ensuring court accessibility. They argue that recent interpretations of laws, particularly the Federal Arbitration Act, have restricted individuals' ability to pursue litigation, thereby closing the courthouse doors to many who seek justice. The authors call for Congress to take action to restore federal rights and limit defendants' ability to control access to the courts, as was done with the recent amendment to the arbitration statute for victims of sexual assault and harassment. They emphasize the need for a chief justice who engages in serious discussions about the issues facing the federal courts, suggesting that Chief Justice Roberts has not adequately addressed these challenges in his report."	0.026210000000000004	affirmative action	txt/2761519572.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text discusses the controversy surrounding the delayed notification of National Merit Scholarship recognitions at several high schools in Northern Virginia. Students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (""TJ"") and other schools were not informed of their awards, prompting a civil-rights investigation by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares. The issue is set against the backdrop of Fairfax County's public education system, which has been accused of waging a ""war on achievement"" and implementing an equity agenda that disadvantages high-achieving students, particularly those of Asian-American descent. The text cites changes to TJ's admissions policy that aimed to increase African-American and Hispanic representation at the expense of Asian-American students. It also references the use of a consultant who defines equity as ""equal outcomes for every student,"" and an instance where a TJ official allegedly downplayed the importance of student achievements.

Author's Perspective:
The author, William McGurn, appears critical of affirmative action policies, especially as they pertain to public education in Fairfax County. McGurn suggests that these policies, while intended to prevent discrimination, have instead led to discrimination against high-achieving students, particularly Asian-Americans. He points to the changes in admissions policy at TJ as an example of an attempt to artificially balance racial representation, which he implies undermines meritocracy. McGurn also indicates a broader discontent with the way school officials handle parental concerns and the overall direction of the educational system, which he believes is increasingly dismissive of individual achievements in favor of a misguided pursuit of equity. The tone of the text is one of skepticism toward the intentions and actions of school officials and a defense of the value of recognizing and rewarding individual merit and achievement."	0.02171	affirmative action	txt/2765919087.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text, vivek ramaswamy, is strongly against affirmative action.	"The text is a political and cultural manifesto by Vivek Ramaswamy, who announces his run for the presidency of the United States. Ramaswamy criticizes the current state of American identity, which he believes is weakened by the decline of faith, patriotism, and hard work, and the rise of ""secular religions"" like climatism, Covidism, and gender ideology. He proposes to redefine the American Dream, emphasizing merit and the pursuit of excellence over monetary success. Ramaswamy advocates for merit-based immigration, the elimination of affirmative action, a meritocracy in governance by limiting the power of unelected bureaucrats, and the protection of free speech from government-influenced censorship. Furthermore, he suggests that America should strive for economic independence from China, reclaim global energy leadership, and protect national security interests.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is viewed negatively as a practice that undermines the principle of merit in the American economy. Ramaswamy expresses his intention to abolish affirmative action, criticizing it for fostering resentment and condescension by disadvantaging qualified applicants based on their race, particularly those who are white or Asian-American. He argues that affirmative action spawns resentment and damages the perception of black and Hispanic hires by suggesting they may not have been hired based on merit. By rescinding Executive Order 11246 and directing the Justice Department to prosecute what he considers illegal race-based preferences, Ramaswamy aims to establish a system where success in America is determined solely by individual merit and qualifications, without regard to race or ethnicity."	0.0225	affirmative action	txt/2778538694.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they criticize the u.s. supreme court for decisions that impact college admissions and student aid, which likely includes affirmative action policies. they are concerned about the court's conservative agenda and its impact on such policies.	"The text criticizes the current U.S. Supreme Court for overstepping its constitutional role and acting as a partisan political entity rather than a neutral judicial body. The author argues that the court has been subverting democracy by overturning longstanding laws, impacting various aspects of American life such as women's health, college admissions, and student aid. They express concern that the court is not following established legal principles, such as stare decisis, and is instead pursuing outcomes aligned with a conservative agenda. The author also highlights the court's refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, suggesting this undermines their impartiality and legitimacy. They suggest that reforms such as term limits or court expansion may be necessary to preserve democracy and the court's proper role within it.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Supreme Court's handling of the issue. They view the court's decisions on affirmative action, along with LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness, as morally and politically offensive to many Americans. They argue that the court's approach has been to disregard legal doctrine and manipulate facts to justify predetermined outcomes, rather than engaging in fair and impartial judgment. The author indicates that the court's actions on affirmative action are part of a broader pattern of judicial activism that prioritizes a right-wing policy agenda over the principles of self-government and legal consistency."	0.024790000000000003	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of jobs and higher education, in light of the Supreme Court's decision to end the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions. The author suggests that with AI replacing many white-collar jobs, there may be less value in a traditional college education, and it might be more practical to focus on developing skills for physical jobs that AI cannot perform. They mention how AI is affecting the job market for writers, with some losing clients to AI and having to pivot to other careers like HVAC technician or dog walker. The author also touches on new technology, like a ""wearable AI assistant,"" that could further change how humans interact with devices and each other.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is becoming less relevant in a world where AI is reshaping the job landscape. They express concern for the immediate impact on students of color who might have benefited from affirmative action, while also noting the broader implications for academia as young men, and potentially Black and Brown students, abandon college. The author seems to question the Supreme Court's view that affirmative action is no longer needed, indicating a belief that many Americans might still support such measures. They conclude with a quote from a local innkeeper who humorously wishes the Supreme Court were an AI chatbot, perhaps suggesting a desire for a more impartial or progressive decision-making process. The overall tone of the author seems to be one of skepticism and concern about the rapid advancement of AI and its effects on society, coupled with a sense of irony and a hint of nostalgia for human qualities that AI cannot replicate."	0.02284	affirmative action	txt/2832643195.xml.txt
	None	the authors of the letters do not directly address affirmative action; their focus is on the supreme court's decision regarding lgbtq+ rights and religious freedom. therefore, their perspective on affirmative action cannot be categorized based on the provided information.	"The letters to the editor discuss the Supreme Court's decision in 303 Creative v. Elenis, where the court sided with a web designer who refused to provide services to same-sex couples. The writers express concerns about the implications of this ruling for LGBTQ+ rights and the potential for discrimination under the guise of religious freedom or free speech. They also criticize the court for entertaining a hypothetical scenario that had not occurred in reality. One writer fears the ruling sets a precedent for overt discrimination, while another questions the integrity of the case's details. There's also contemplation about the complexities of the decision and how rights can be double-edged swords, as illustrated by a hypothetical situation involving a talented Black gay website creator being asked to make a site for anti-gay white supremacists.

The authors of the letters appear to share a perspective that is critical of affirmative action's recent challenges, particularly in the context of the Supreme Court's track record. They express concern that the court's decisions, including the one in 303 Creative v. Elenis and the dismantling of affirmative action, indicate a trend towards prioritizing the rights of a minority (in this case, based on religious beliefs) over the rights and protections of the majority or marginalized groups. This perspective suggests a fear that the court's rulings are eroding the progress made in civil rights and equal treatment under the law, potentially leading to a society where discrimination is legally sanctioned. The writers demonstrate a clear apprehension about the direction in which the Supreme Court is heading regarding civil liberties and equal protection."	0.01793	affirmative action	txt/2833402706.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author, ibert schultz, is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the challenges faced by Black students in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that banned affirmative action and established a ""colorblind"" approach to college admissions. The author, Ibert Schultz, is the executive director of Black College Success, a nonprofit organization in South Los Angeles that helps Black students navigate the college admission process. Schultz provides a stark picture of the situation in California since the state passed Proposition 209 in 1996, which led to a significant decrease in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities. He shares the sobering statistics of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District, highlighting their low college enrollment and graduation rates, as well as the economic challenges they face. Despite these obstacles, Schultz celebrates the success of his team in helping 208 students gain admission to various colleges, including prestigious institutions. The author describes the comprehensive support provided by Black College Success, from academic planning to career guidance, aiming to level the playing field for students who lack the advantages of their more affluent peers.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is one of concern and apprehension about the potential negative impact of its removal on Black students and their communities. Schultz's experience with Black College Success has shown him that the combination of academic support, guidance, and students' determination can lead to success. However, he fears that the ""colorblind"" admissions policy will overlook the unique experiences of Black applicants, resulting in fewer opportunities for them and a loss for society as a whole. Schultz implicitly argues for the importance of considering racial and socioeconomic factors in college admissions to ensure equity and diversity, and he seems to view affirmative action as a necessary tool to counteract systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect Black students."	0.02178	affirmative action	txt/2837300226.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"UC Irvine has been actively engaging its academic community for over eight months to address the issue of diversity, under the guidance of Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. The university is in the process of establishing a Diversity Council, tasked with enhancing support for diversity, particularly among the middle ranks of the institution. This initiative coincides with discussions on affirmative action, especially in light of UC Regent Ward Connerly's opposition to race-based preferences. UCI has shown a commitment to diversity both on and off-campus, as evidenced by its involvement with local high school students and alumni activities, such as the creation of a multicultural mural. The university is also recognized for its high percentage of Asian students and events like the Asian Pacific Awareness Conference. However, UCI acknowledges the need to improve the representation of women and minorities in faculty positions. The community's support for diversity is reflected in a survey indicating that a significant majority of Orange County residents see the value in programs that promote interethnic dialogue.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive, as they highlight the importance of diversity initiatives at UC Irvine and the broader community's recognition of their value. The author distinguishes between diversity and affirmative action but suggests that they are often intertwined in conversations, indicating a nuanced understanding of the issues. They also point out the timely nature of UCI's efforts in light of Connerly's stance against affirmative action, implying that such efforts are necessary to counteract moves to eliminate race-based preferences. The author seems to endorse the view that diversity is an asset and a selling point for UCI, as stated by Chancellor Wilkening, and underscores the community's desire for programs that foster ethnic dialogue, which could be interpreted as a tacit endorsement of affirmative action policies that aim to achieve such diversity."	0.016440000000000003	affirmative action	txt/293028806.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text appears to be neutral on affirmative action, focusing instead on the political climate and potential candidates' positions without expressing a personal stance on the policy itself.	"The text discusses the general disinterest in the potential nominees for the upcoming presidential election, with Bill Clinton appealing to a consistent but limited portion of voters, and Republican candidates like Bob Dole and Phil Gramm failing to generate excitement. The author suggests that this lack of enthusiasm is due to both the candidates' personalities and a broader discontent with American politics, including distrust in political professionals and dissatisfaction with the ideological solutions proposed by both the left and right. The author then introduces Colin Powell, who at the time was promoting his memoirs and inadvertently setting the stage for a potential political campaign. Powell, described as charismatic and possessing leadership qualities, has begun to share his moderate views on domestic issues, which may not align with the 1996 GOP convention's expectations. Nevertheless, the author points out that there is a public desire for an alternative to the traditional two-party candidates and that Powell's strong character could make him a viable contender.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is one of several policy positions that Colin Powell has begun to articulate as he considers a potential run for the presidency. The author notes that Powell supports ""some affirmative action,"" suggesting a measured approach to the policy. This inclusion of Powell's stance on affirmative action is presented within the context of his broader political positioning, which is portrayed as moderate and centrist. The author does not delve deeply into the nuances of Powell's views on affirmative action or their implications, but rather presents them as part of a suite of policy positions that could influence Powell's appeal to voters who are seeking an alternative to the established political choices. Powell's moderate stance on issues, including affirmative action, is highlighted as an aspect that could either challenge his acceptance within the GOP or contribute to his appeal as a fresh and potentially unifying figure in a polarized political landscape."	0.01844	affirmative action	txt/293063140.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text describes the historical significance of Cinco de Mayo, a Mexican holiday commemorating a victory over French forces, which has become a popular celebration in California and across the United States. The author reflects on the irony of celebrating a Mexican holiday in California amidst the state's financial and political struggles, including anti-immigration sentiments and opposition to affirmative action. Despite these issues, the author expresses a deep connection to California, having moved from Texas and experienced both overt racism there and a more subtle form in California. The text also touches on the cultural impact of California on the author's life, including the state's influence on fashion and the author's admiration for various Californian leaders and activists of Mexican descent.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of the anti-affirmative action initiatives in California. He likens the current mood in California to the vigilante attitude of the past and compares it unfavorably with his experiences of racism in Texas. The author's negative view of the anti-affirmative action initiative suggests he sees it as a step backward in the progress towards racial equality and social justice. His attachment to California is strong, but he is disheartened by the state's political climate, particularly its stance on immigration and affirmative action. The author's appreciation for the contributions of Mexican American leaders in California further underscores his support for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, which are often the goals of affirmative action programs."	0.020700000000000003	affirmative action	txt/293087956.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, given their critical view of the decision to end it and the implication that it was driven by political rather than educational motives.	"Summary:
In 1967, UC President Clark Kerr was fired by Governor Ronald Reagan, which was met with outrage by faculty and students who saw it as a politically motivated act. Nearly three decades later, the University of California system is again embroiled in controversy, this time over the issue of affirmative action. The UC Board of Regents, influenced by Governor Pete Wilson's political ambitions, voted to end race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring, a decision opposed by chancellors, student governments, and the Faculty Senate. New UC President Richard C. Atkinson faced the challenge of implementing this policy but delayed its full enforcement, drawing criticism from Wilson and his allies on the board. Atkinson eventually conceded to speed up the policy's implementation after facing a potential review of his performance.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to be critical of the political interference in the University of California's governance, particularly regarding affirmative action policies. They suggest that the regents' decision to end affirmative action was partly driven by Governor Wilson's presidential campaign needs rather than educational considerations. The author also implies that President Atkinson's delay in implementing the policy was a political move to support affirmative action, which he had backed as chancellor at UC San Diego. The author emphasizes the constitutional authority of the regents but raises concerns about the impact of these political disputes on the university's mission to educate students. They argue that leadership should focus on creating outreach programs to address systemic race bias and support underprivileged students, rather than getting bogged down in political squabbles that ultimately harm the students' interests. The author advocates for leaders who can guide the university effectively into the future."	0.022860000000000002	affirmative action	txt/293295109.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they highlight its potential injustices and suggest the need for more nuanced approaches to equality that do not solely focus on group identity.	"The text critiques affirmative action as a policy that does not aim to generally expand opportunities or reduce income disparities, but rather to redistribute existing opportunities among different racial, ethnic, and gender groups. It contrasts affirmative action with traditional redistributive programs that are based on individual needs rather than group identity, suggesting that the latter are more flexible and inclusive. The text argues that affirmative action is a zero-sum game that can lead to injustices, such as when it benefits affluent members of minority groups over disadvantaged individuals from non-minority backgrounds.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a complex and imperfect solution to societal inequalities. While recognizing the historical injustices faced by minority groups and the importance of inclusion, the author also acknowledges the concerns of those who feel that affirmative action may unfairly impact their own chances or those of their children. The author suggests that both opponents and supporters of affirmative action need to understand each other's valid points and limitations of the policy. The author proposes that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that addresses equality of opportunity for all disadvantaged individuals, regardless of their group identity. The possibility of a commission to study affirmative action is mentioned, with the hope that it would lead to a more comprehensive debate and strategies to achieve a fairer distribution of opportunities."	0.02077	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems somewhat in favor of affirmative action, but with reservations about its implementation and potential consequences.	"The text discusses the controversy surrounding affirmative action at The Washington Post, sparked by a critical article written by Ruth Shalit in the New Republic. Shalit accused The Post of lowering its hiring and news coverage standards to meet affirmative action goals, leading to ""racial strife."" The Post's editor, Leonard Downie Jr., and publisher, Donald E. Graham, vehemently denied these claims, defending the integrity of their hiring practices and news coverage. They emphasized that the newspaper's goals to increase diversity are not quotas, and that quality remains a top priority.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They recognize the complexity of implementing such policies within a competitive and contracting newspaper industry, acknowledging the emotional impact on white males who perceive these goals as unfair quotas. The author also notes the potential negative consequences for both whites, who may feel threatened by affirmative action, and blacks, who may face stigmatization. While the author admires The Post's commitment to diversity and racial justice, they suggest that the focus should shift from numerical targets to a broader goal of absolute nondiscrimination, with the ultimate measure of success being the quality of the newspaper produced, not the demographics of its staff."	0.01827	affirmative action	txt/307918907.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the impact of affirmative action on white men, suggesting that approximately one in ten have been adversely affected by such policies. The author notes that affirmative action has often been implemented in zero-sum situations where gains for one group result in losses for another, particularly affecting white men under 45 in the public sector. The author's research, which includes interviews with white men in California, indicates that many have experienced job losses or career disruptions due to affirmative action, often without open complaint for fear of being labeled racist. The text also describes the political response to these grievances, with some politicians using the issue to garner support while others dismiss the complaints or suppress related research findings.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly of its implementation and the lack of acknowledgment of its negative effects on white men. The author argues that affirmative action policies have, in some cases, devolved into a racial spoils system, which has led to resentment and division. The author emphasizes that criticisms of affirmative action policies by white men should not be automatically dismissed as racism, and he advocates for a more open discussion about the policies' impacts. By highlighting the personal stories of those affected and the political dynamics surrounding the issue, the author calls for a reevaluation of affirmative action to address its unintended consequences and to ensure fairness for all individuals, regardless of race."	0.029090000000000005	affirmative action	txt/398288078.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the misconceptions about the difference in views and aspirations between black and white Americans, highlighting that both groups share common goals such as safe neighborhoods, good education, and homeownership. A survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies shows that black Americans are more conservative than often portrayed by politicians and civil rights organizations, with a significant number identifying as conservative. However, the Republican Party has not been successful in attracting black conservatives due to a history of neglect or hostility towards issues important to black Americans. The text also points out that while civil rights leaders focus on policies like racial quotas and set-asides, many black Americans prioritize practical solutions to crime, economic stagnation, and education. The author suggests that conservative groups should work on issues that align with the interests of mainstream black communities, such as school choice and empowerment initiatives.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, as the text reveals a disconnect between the views of black community leaders and the general black population on the importance of affirmative action in hiring and education. While many black leaders see affirmative action as a key issue, the majority of black Americans surveyed believe that merit should be the main factor in these decisions. The author argues that civil rights leaders are out of touch with the actual needs and opinions of their constituency and that their focus on social engineering and quotas is less relevant to the real problems faced by many black individuals. The author advocates for a shift away from redistributive policies based on race towards empowering disadvantaged individuals through traditional American values of equality and opportunity."	0.02521	affirmative action	txt/398299761.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, given their positive portrayal of both thurgood marshall and clarence thomas's interpretations of constitutional equality, which align with the principles of affirmative action. however, the author also emphasizes a colorblind approach to constitutional interpretation, which might suggest a nuanced perspective on the implementation of affirmative action policies.	"The NAACP is contemplating whether to oppose the nomination of a black Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, with some members expressing a preference for another justice in the mold of Thurgood Marshall. Critics of Thomas have overlooked his alignment with Marshall's broad interpretation of constitutional equality, as argued in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education. Both Marshall and Thomas have criticized the Supreme Court's reliance on sociological studies in its decision and have advocated for a legal and constitutional basis for equality, referencing the Declaration of Independence and the Fourteenth Amendment. Thomas has argued that the court should have focused on the historical context of segregation's roots in slavery, rather than on environmental factors, to understand the principles of equality and liberty.

The author presents a perspective that sees Clarence Thomas as a rightful successor to Thurgood Marshall's legacy on civil rights, despite the NAACP's hesitancy. The author emphasizes that both Marshall and Thomas sought a colorblind interpretation of the Constitution and grounded their arguments in natural rights and original intent. The author suggests that Thomas's critics mischaracterize his views, which are not based on conservative policy preferences but on a principled understanding of equality that rejects judicial activism in favor of original-meaning jurisprudence. The author implies that the NAACP should recognize the similarities between Marshall and Thomas on civil rights issues and reconsider their stance, potentially breaking from their liberal allies who oppose Thomas's nomination."	0.02153	affirmative action	txt/398321574.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, particularly in its current form involving quotas and race or sex-based preferences.	"The text discusses efforts in California to dismantle affirmative action policies, focusing on initiatives led by Ward Connerly, a University of California regent. Connerly, who is black, has raised concerns about race-based admissions and seeks alternatives that do not involve race or sex as factors in university enrollment. He advocates for marketing the university to underrepresented groups and assisting them in preparing for applications. The text also highlights the political landscape, mentioning legislative attempts to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring, and contracting, as well as the California Civil Rights Initiative, a proposed constitutional amendment to outlaw quotas. There is a debate over the effectiveness of these measures, with opposition from those who benefit from quotas and support from moderate Democrats and others who see the current state of affirmative action as divisive.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical of its current implementation, particularly the use of quotas and institutional mandates. The author suggests that affirmative action has deviated from its original intent, which was to level the playing field for those who need help competing, and now instead focuses on group preferences that can lead to resentment and division. The author appears to support a reevaluation and reform of affirmative action policies to emphasize individual achievement and preparation over racial or gender-based preferences. The mention of the California Civil Rights Initiative and its potential to change the state and national agenda indicates the author believes in the possibility of significant reform driven by grassroots support and moderate political backing."	0.01908	affirmative action	txt/398441227.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
William Weld, a Republican governor of Massachusetts, gained popularity by combining fiscal conservatism with social libertarianism. However, his support has waned due to a series of unpopular decisions, such as approving a pay raise for state legislators and siding with costly mandates for hiring off-duty police for roadwork. Critics like Barbara Anderson have accused him of abandoning his reformist values. Weld has also been criticized for not pushing for supply-side tax cuts and failing to pass a death penalty bill despite public support. He has alienated conservative supporters, the ""Weldocrats,"" by endorsing affirmative action, which contrasts with his initial campaign promises. Weld's shift in stance has led to a loss of trust among his base and skepticism about his brand of Republicanism.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author presents a critical view of Governor Weld's stance on affirmative action, suggesting that his endorsement of the policy at a Northeastern University graduation ceremony was a significant betrayal to his conservative supporters, particularly the ""Weldocrats."" The author implies that Weld's defense of affirmative action contradicts the expectations of his voter base, who feel sidelined by such policies. Weld's justification for affirmative action, which highlights the higher unemployment rates among blacks compared to whites, is presented as dismissive of the concerns of white contractors affected by these policies. The author suggests that Weld's approach to affirmative action and other policies indicates a broader issue with ""new-age fusion Republicanism,"" where the integrity and consistency of political leaders are in question. Weld's shift to the left on affirmative action is depicted as a politically expedient move that disregards the values and needs of his earlier supporters."	0.027950000000000003	affirmative action	txt/398469346.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, suggesting that other economic measures could reduce the need for it.	"The text argues for the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to support a capital gains tax cut, suggesting that it would stimulate economic growth and benefit the black community by freeing up capital for new investments, particularly in black-controlled companies, which can create jobs. The author emphasizes that venture capital, likely to be boosted by such a tax cut, has been effective in job creation, citing a study showing significant job growth from venture-capital-backed companies. The text also points out that very little private equity, despite its large total value, has been invested in black firms, which is seen as a national issue. The author proposes that the government could encourage investments in black-owned businesses through regulatory interpretations and by prompting the brokerage industry to raise capital for these companies. However, the author maintains that these measures are not substitutes for a capital gains tax cut, which would directly increase the flow of venture capital to black businesses, fostering job creation within the black community.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that while it is a valuable policy, it could become unnecessary if the availability of investment capital for black entrepreneurs is increased. The author believes that economic policies that stimulate growth in black business, like a capital gains tax cut, could have a more sustainable and long-term positive impact on the black community by creating jobs and opportunities, thereby reducing the need for affirmative action. The text suggests that affirmative action could be replaced by the economic empowerment of black businesses, which would in turn provide employment to the black workforce, addressing the root causes of inequality."	0.018940000000000002	affirmative action	txt/398482848.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text criticizes President Clinton's nomination of Alexis Herman for Labor Secretary, suggesting that her involvement with the White House Office of Public Liaison places her at the center of a campaign-contributions controversy. The text also highlights a memo related to outreach to the African-American community, which the author views as evidence of quota-based thinking within the Democratic Party. The memo, they argue, reflects a mindset focused on meeting specific racial and gender representation goals, akin to the party's approach to delegate selection for the Democratic convention. The author expresses concern that the Democratic Party appears to prioritize the demands of its constituent factions, despite presenting a moderate front to the public. They question whether Alexis Herman, once confirmed as Labor Secretary, would be able to set aside this faction-driven approach, especially given the Labor Department's significant role in enforcing affirmative action through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and skeptical. They imply that affirmative action practices, as exemplified by the Democrats' internal policies and Herman's involvement, are quota-driven rather than merit-based. The author is concerned that such practices may continue under Herman's leadership at the Labor Department, which has significant influence over corporate affirmative action policies due to its regulatory power over federal contractors. The text suggests that the author believes the Labor Secretary should possess ""great judgment and sensitivity,"" implicitly questioning whether Herman's past actions align with these qualities. The reference to the Texaco case indicates the author's view that corporate America is increasingly grappling with racial issues and that affirmative action is a contentious and divisive topic in the broader societal context."	0.016850000000000004	affirmative action	txt/398530550.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text criticizes the lack of nuance in contemporary debates, particularly in the context of affirmative action and government set-asides. It highlights the case of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) and the subsequent formation of the American Civil Rights Institute, which aims to challenge government-sponsored quotas and set-asides. The author notes that CCRI passed with notable minority support, suggesting that even within minority communities, there is a desire for more nuanced discussions on affirmative action. The text also discusses the case of Astroline Communications Company, which benefited from an FCC policy that was later struck down by the Supreme Court, and presents evidence that the company may not have been genuinely minority-controlled.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly of its all-or-nothing proponents. The author implies that affirmative action policies, such as the FCC's minority distress sale policy, can be abused or manipulated, as potentially exemplified by the Astroline case. The perspective suggests that the public is becoming skeptical of rigid affirmative action policies, as evidenced by the support for CCRI and the scrutiny of cases like Astroline and Texaco. The author argues for the return of ""useful distinctions"" in public discourse, advocating for a more balanced and credible approach to affirmative action that acknowledges its complexities and the potential for misuse. The text implies that without such distinctions, the credibility of affirmative action as a whole may be undermined."	0.018140000000000003	affirmative action	txt/398538903.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, acknowledging its complexities and the need for a balanced approach to address past discrimination while also recognizing potential drawbacks.	"The text discusses the challenges faced by President Clinton's initiative on race, including the perceived lack of political skill by John Hope Franklin, the head of the National Advisory Committee on Race, and the exclusion of whites from a racial dialogue. The president's town meeting in Akron is described as unfocused, and Clinton is criticized for a contentious exchange with an affirmative action critic. Despite the initiative's rocky start, the author believes the effort is commendable given America's long-standing issues with race. The White House is reported to be taking more control over the advisory committee and is planning new proposals focused on youth for the upcoming State of the Union address. The initiative is also making an effort to include conservative voices in the conversation.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is a contentious and divisive issue in America, with public opinion split depending on how affirmative action is framed. The author provides examples of affirmative action in practice, such as the U.S. Military Academy's efforts to increase African-American enrollment, and argues that completely abandoning affirmative action is not the solution. The author notes that even some conservative African-Americans call for caution before dismantling existing programs. General Colin Powell is cited as having a balanced view on the matter, recognizing the need for temporary measures to address past discrimination while also acknowledging the potential drawbacks of preferential treatment. The author calls for a more nuanced and less inflammatory discussion on affirmative action, suggesting that if President Clinton's initiative can contribute to this, it would be a significant achievement."	0.02346	affirmative action	txt/398602003.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, given their critical view of the implementation within texaco and the mention of public ambivalence towards racial preferences.	"The text discusses the author's experience listening to the Texaco tapes, which were initially believed to contain racist remarks by Texaco's former treasurer, Robert Ulrich. The media had accused Ulrich of using the ""n"" word and referring to ""black jelly bean"" as a racist term. However, after Texaco enhanced the audio, it was revealed that the word was actually ""Nicholas"" and the term ""jelly bean"" was used to promote multicultural unity. The author criticizes the media for their eagerness to find scandal and their lack of depth in reporting. The tapes, recorded by Richard Lundwall, a finance manager at Texaco who was later let go, covered various mundane aspects of corporate life as well as serious issues like downsizing and affirmative action. The author notes that while the finance department was reducing staff, they were also encouraged to increase diversity. The text also touches upon the complexities of diversity initiatives and the public's mixed feelings about racial preferences.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and nuanced. They recognize the stress within the organization regarding race and the conflicting goals of downsizing and increasing minority representation. The author suggests that the tapes provide more reliable evidence of the company's internal struggles with race than the alleged use of a racial slur. They point out the irony of firing employees while recruiting minorities and the lack of evidence that this tension bothered anyone at Texaco. The author also mentions the public's ambivalence toward racial preferences, as demonstrated by California voters' rejection of affirmative action despite their support for Bill Clinton. The author seems to advocate for a more genuine approach to human dignity that goes beyond performative ""sensitivity"" and questions the effectiveness of racial preferences as a solution to diversity challenges. They imply that there may be value in maintaining some traditional perspectives within a company, as long as the core business objectives, such as finding oil, are met."	0.028040000000000002	affirmative action	txt/398612922.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against affirmative action.	"The text criticizes the American Bar Association (ABA) for engaging in non-legal matters such as supporting abortion rights, endorsing affirmative action, and calling for a death penalty moratorium. It argues that the ABA has adopted an anti-business agenda, evidenced by its resolution to make it easier to certify class actions for settlement purposes and its opposition to proposals that would limit ""coupon"" settlements. The ABA also opposes reform in the tort system, such as a loser pays rule, limits on pain and suffering awards, and ceilings on medical malpractice damages. Furthermore, the ABA favors government mandates on business and has resisted proposals to limit contingency fees. It is also accused of using selective evidence to deny the increase in personal injury suits, indicating a bias in favor of litigation. The author suggests that the ABA's stances, which are promoted by its paid lobbyists, undermine its ability to fairly carry out its functions in certifying lawyers, law schools, and advising on judicial nominations.

From the author's perspective, the ABA's actions reflect a liberal agenda that neglects the interests of businesses and favors the plaintiffs' bar. The author is critical of the ABA's involvement in social and foreign policy issues, viewing it as an overreach beyond its professional scope. There is a clear disapproval of the ABA's lobbying against civil justice reform and its failure to limit contingency fees, which the author believes contribute to an excessive litigation culture. The text implies that the ABA's positions are self-serving, aimed at preserving the financial interests of lawyers rather than serving the broader legal community or the public interest. The author's tone suggests that the ABA's credibility and objectivity in its quasi-governmental roles are compromised by its partisan stances and advocacy."	0.02213	affirmative action	txt/398630711.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, based on the critical view of how the media handles the topic and the suggestion that liberal views on social issues like affirmative action are often presented without skepticism.	"The text discusses the issue of perceived liberal bias in mainstream media, particularly in the evening newscasts of the big three networks, as seen by conservatives. Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and Peter Jennings are mentioned as figures who deny having a liberal bias, despite a poll indicating that a significant number of both Republicans and Democrats perceive such a bias. The author suggests that these media figures might not even recognize what constitutes a liberal bias, citing an example of Dan Rather's reaction to being questioned about his political leanings and his view of the New York Times as ""middle of the road.""

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the media's treatment of the topic. He suggests that media elites, including reporters and anchors, tend to pass along liberal views on social issues like affirmative action without the same skepticism they would apply to conservative perspectives. The author implies that the media often presents liberal positions on issues such as affirmative action as the default or ""reasonable"" view, neglecting to label them as ""liberal"" while being quick to identify conservative views as such. This, he argues, is indicative of an unconscious bias within the media that arises from being insulated from opposing viewpoints in their personal and professional circles. The author calls for media figures to acknowledge and reflect on their potential biases instead of dismissing the concerns of those who detect a liberal slant in their reporting."	0.022320000000000003	affirmative action	txt/398730713.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, as they highlight its unintended consequences and criticize its implementation in corporations.	"The text discusses the challenges Coca-Cola faced amidst a racial bias lawsuit, including a difficult financial year, leadership changes, and a health scare in Belgium. The company's public relations struggles have made it a target for criticism, and journalists like Business Week's Dean Foust have freely accused Coke of racism based on historical events involving the company's Southern bottlers and a former CEO's alleged comments on civil rights. However, the article suggests that these accusations are not supported by historical evidence, which shows efforts by Coke to fight against racial discrimination. The text also criticizes the handling of another racial incident involving Texaco, where a misinterpreted transcript led to a substantial settlement despite Texaco's claims of innocence. The demand for Coke to settle the current lawsuit is high, and the author suggests that the media lacks skepticism in reporting these issues.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, especially with regard to its implementation in corporations. They argue that affirmative action has led to unintended consequences like tokenism and stigmatization, which sociologists refer to as a ""social trap."" The author believes that while corporations have learned to manage diversity as a fact of life, integrating employees into a company culture is more complex than simply hiring them. They note that informal networks and diversity management are important for helping minority employees succeed. The author also implies that journalists often oversimplify racial matters, ignoring the broader context of employee frustrations within a company. They suggest that companies like Coke are learning and adapting to diversity management, but the process is nuanced and requires a fair approach that considers the interests of all employees."	0.02399	affirmative action	txt/398787032.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they present it in a negative light within a fictional context, suggesting skepticism about its effectiveness and fairness.	"Summary:
The text is a fictional scenario proposed by a New York literary agent for a thriller novel. It describes a militant group called the Hispanic Republican Army (HRA) aiming to return Texas to Mexico, engaging in violent activities such as bombings and assassinations across the state and even in Washington, D.C. Despite the violence, the American public is depicted as indifferent, and the U.S. government, led by a fictional President Bartlet, embarks on a peace process that involves major concessions to the HRA, including integrating its members into Texas state government and law enforcement. The author draws parallels to the British government's handling of Northern Ireland, suggesting that the U.K. has set a disturbing precedent by capitulating to terrorist demands, which could influence how the U.S. might respond to domestic terrorism in the future.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's mention of affirmative action in the context of the fictional scenario seems critical and somewhat sarcastic. They describe how, despite most Latinos in Texas not supporting the militant HRA, they do not mind the affirmative action benefits that have come their way since the violence began. This could imply that the author views affirmative action in this scenario as a byproduct of terrorism rather than a legitimate policy to address inequality. The author's tone suggests a skepticism toward the effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action policies, as they are presented as something that comes about because of unrest rather than through democratic processes. It is important to note that the author's views on affirmative action are embedded within a fictional and exaggerated narrative, which may not directly reflect their stance on real-world affirmative action policies."	0.026400000000000003	affirmative action	txt/398788879.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	"the author of the text seems somewhat against affirmative action, given their critical view of townsend's defense of the policy as ""demagoguery"" and their skepticism about the effectiveness of her campaign strategy related to the issue."	"The text discusses the political situation of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend during her gubernatorial campaign in Maryland. It suggests that had Al Gore chosen her as his vice-presidential candidate in 2000, she might have been vice president instead of struggling in her current campaign. Townsend's campaign has faced challenges, including her choice of a white, former Republican as her running mate, which upset some black leaders in Baltimore, and her inability to secure the state's large black electorate. The author also touches on the contrasting backgrounds of Townsend and her Republican opponent, Robert Ehrlich, and their different campaign strategies. The text highlights the role of race in the election, particularly in a debate where Townsend defended affirmative action, and discusses the potential impact of the sniper attacks in the Washington metropolitan area on the election.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical of Townsend's approach to the issue. The author describes Townsend's defense of affirmative action as ""demagoguery"" and suggests that her attack on Ehrlich's opposition to race-based affirmative action may not be effective. The text implies that Townsend's characterization of the issue, linking it to historical racial injustices, might not resonate with all voters, and could potentially alienate some white voters. Additionally, the author questions whether Townsend's strategy of politicizing issues, such as gun control in the wake of the sniper attacks, will be successful or if it will be perceived as exploitative by voters. Overall, the author appears skeptical of Townsend's tactics and the effectiveness of her campaign messaging, especially regarding sensitive topics like race and affirmative action."	0.024980000000000002	affirmative action	txt/398881739.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they criticize the use of political tactics to influence the outcome of an affirmative action case.	"The text describes a situation where a young man working for the Republican staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee is at risk of losing his job due to the publication of Democratic strategy memos by the Wall Street Journal. These memos revealed the influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic senators regarding judicial nominations. The memos, largely ignored by mainstream media, detailed the groups' involvement in the selection process, particularly in the cases of Miguel Estrada and the Sixth Circuit nominees. The author expresses concern over the political maneuvering behind judicial nominations and criticizes the media for not reporting on the content of the memos. Instead, the focus shifted to the leak and the investigation led by Senator Orrin Hatch, which involved placing a GOP staffer on administrative leave and conducting a costly investigation, despite the fact that a lack of proper security measures on the committee's computer system allowed for easy access to the documents by all staff members.

The author's perspective on affirmative action emerges in the context of the Sixth Circuit judicial nominations, where the memos reveal an attempt by Democrats to delay confirmations to influence the outcome of an affirmative action case. The author appears to be critical of this tactic, suggesting that it represents a politicization of the judiciary and an improper manipulation of the judicial confirmation process to achieve a desired outcome in a case. The use of the term ""political maneuvering"" implies a negative view of the actions taken by the Democrats, as does the suggestion that the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks is not based on principled differences but rather on strategic political considerations. The author seems to advocate for a more principled and less politically driven approach to judicial nominations and the handling of affirmative action cases in the courts."	0.02444	affirmative action	txt/398920534.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the main focus of the text; it is mentioned briefly in the context of political corruption. therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action is not clear, and they should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"The text discusses the political dominance of the Daley family in Chicago, with Richard J. Daley serving as mayor from 1955 to 1976 and his son, Richard M. Daley, taking office in 1989. The author suggests that the Daley dynasty is likely to continue, as no serious contenders appear capable of challenging the current mayor. Despite occasional scandals and criticisms of corruption, the author notes that the Daleys are not seen as thieves but rather as politicians who use their power effectively. The text also highlights the positive changes in Chicago under the younger Daley, such as neighborhood improvements and the creation of Millennium Park. The author points out that while voter turnout is low, this could indicate satisfaction with the mayor's performance or a belief in his invincibility. The Daleys are described as having a limited ambition, content with their mayoral roles rather than seeking higher office, which the author suggests contributes to their success in governing Chicago.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and somewhat cynical. He mentions that Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. has criticized Mayor Daley for scandals related to affirmative-action contracts, implying that such issues are an ingrained part of Chicago politics. However, the author seems skeptical of Jackson's intentions, noting his proclamation of interest in honest government with a ""chortle followed by yawn,"" indicating that he finds the statement insincere or ineffective. The mention of affirmative action is brief and used to illustrate the broader context of political corruption in Chicago, rather than as a focal point for in-depth analysis or discussion. Overall, the author's tone suggests a resignation to the idea that certain levels of corruption and political maneuvering, including those involving affirmative action, are inevitable in big-city governance."	0.026170000000000002	affirmative action	txt/398955309.xml.txt
	None	the author, peter berkowitz, is not concerned with affirmative action.	"The text provided by the user is an article by Peter Berkowitz discussing the lack of coverage of conservative ideas and thinkers in the political science curriculum at many American universities. Berkowitz points out that despite the relevance of conservative thought to political science, courses on this subject are rare, particularly within the subfields of American politics and political theory. He notes that while there are specialized courses on various liberal and progressive theories, conservative thought, which has a rich tradition from Edmund Burke to Ronald Reagan, is largely ignored. This omission, according to Berkowitz, leads to an incomplete and unbalanced education in political science.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action for conservatives is not the solution to this curricular oversight. Berkowitz argues that political science departments should not hire professors based on their political opinions or compromise scholarly standards. Instead, he suggests that the study and teaching of conservative ideas should be based on intellectual rigor and a desire to understand political thought comprehensively, regardless of the instructor's personal political leanings. Berkowitz believes that adding courses on conservatism would not only improve liberal education but could also potentially reduce political polarization by fostering mutual understanding between the left and right.

"The text is an obituary and retrospective of Jesse Helms, a conservative U.S. Senator who passed away at the age of 86. Helms was known for his principled stand on issues like social conservatism, anti-Communism, and assertive foreign policy. He was also recognized for his political skills, such as supporting Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign and using direct-mail lists to mobilize grassroots support. However, his legacy is marred by his controversial stances on racial issues and support for authoritarian regimes. Despite this, Helms did show the capacity to change, as seen in his later support for Israel and AIDS funding in Africa. The author, Mr. Fund, is a columnist for WSJ.com.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as it relates to Jesse Helms, is that Helms's criticisms were valid in the context of government overreach. However, the author suggests that Helms failed to adequately address the broader social and moral issues in the South, particularly the need for transformation and explicit condemnation of racism. The author contrasts media portrayals of Helms with those of Sam Ervin, another conservative with a problematic civil rights record, to highlight inconsistencies in how the mainstream media contextualizes the careers of public figures. Overall, the author acknowledges Helms's complexity, noting both his unwavering conservatism and his occasional shifts in position."	0.022670000000000003	affirmative action	txt/399055159.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the potential impact of Barack Obama's presidency on African-American progress, questioning whether his administration would significantly contribute to the advancement of the black community. It reflects on historical debates between black civic leaders like W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington on the best path to progress—political integration or economic independence. The text notes that despite the increase in black elected officials since the 1970s and some socioeconomic advances, significant disparities still exist between black and white Americans. The author references economist Thomas Sowell, who argues that political activity is not typically a factor in a group's rise from poverty to prosperity, citing examples of various ethnic groups that achieved economic success before political success.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and suggests skepticism about its effectiveness. The author cites Sowell's research, which indicates that political success does not necessarily lead to socioeconomic advancement and that for some groups, like the Irish in America, political dominance did not translate into economic prosperity. The author argues that Obama's political success may not lead to black upward mobility and criticizes Obama's policies, such as support for minimum wage laws and opposition to educational choice, as potentially harmful to the economic progress of African-Americans. The author, Mr. Riley, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, implies that Obama's liberal policies may maintain current obstacles to black progress rather than alleviate them, with the only change being the president's race. Riley's stance reflects a broader skepticism about the role of government intervention in achieving racial equality and emphasizes the importance of economic self-sufficiency and educational opportunities over political representation and affirmative action policies."	0.02237	affirmative action	txt/399070959.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
The text recounts an incident at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), where a student employee, Keith Sampson, faced accusations of racial harassment for reading a book titled ""Notre Dame Vs. the Klan"" during his work breaks. Despite the book being historical in nature, Sampson was warned by his union representative and an affirmative action officer that he could be fired for bringing the book to work, equating it to Klan propaganda. The university's affirmative action office sent Sampson a letter stating that his reading of the book constituted racial harassment. After intervention by the ACLU and negative media coverage, the university backtracked, with the affirmative action officer clarifying that reading scholarly material on break was permissible and that the previous letter was only addressing conduct that caused concern among co-workers. The university's media relations attempted to distance the case from the book Sampson was reading, vaguely attributing the charges to ""harassing behavior."" Ultimately, under pressure from advocacy groups, the university chancellor expressed regret over the incident.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Dorothy Rabinowitz, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, appears critical of the implementation of affirmative action policies at the university level, particularly as they pertain to this case at IUPUI. She implies that the policies lead to hypersensitivity and overzealous interpretations of racial harassment, as evidenced by the university's initial reaction to Sampson's reading material. Rabinowitz suggests that such policies can result in absurd situations where intellectual pursuit and freedom of expression are stifled. Moreover, she connects this incident to a broader societal issue, where accusations of racism are readily made in the political arena, particularly during the election campaign she refers to. The author's critique of affirmative action seems to be rooted in a concern for its potential to create an environment where fear of being labeled racist overshadows rational discourse and the pursuit of knowledge."	0.029700000000000004	affirmative action	txt/399095057.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action itself but is critical of the influence that foundations have on its advocacy and implementation. the focus is on the lack of accountability and transparency in how foundations affect public policy, including affirmative action, rather than on the merits or drawbacks of affirmative action as a policy. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be categorized based on the provided information, as the critique is aimed at the role of foundations rather than the policy itself.	"The text discusses the role of nonprofit, tax-exempt foundations in the United States, their influence on public policy, and the scrutiny—or lack thereof—that they receive from the media and the public. Thirty years ago, there was a brief period of media interest in foundations when it was revealed that some acted as conduits for CIA subsidies. However, this interest waned, and the issue faded from public memory. The text notes that foundations are supposed to forswear attempts to influence politics to maintain their tax-exempt status, but this rule is often violated. The number of foundations has nearly doubled in the past 15 years, with assets exceeding $200 billion. The author also points out that foundations have significant influence over public policy and social programs, and even within private organizations, such as the NAACP and MALDEF, which rely heavily on foundation funding. The text also touches on the civic journalism movement, funded by foundations, which aims to involve the public in setting media agendas, but has drawn criticism for potentially compromising press independence.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly regarding the influence of foundations on its advocacy and implementation. The text highlights that the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), an organization with a significant role in debates over immigration and affirmative action, has no members and relies mostly on funding from foundations like the Ford Foundation. This raises concerns about the organization's accountability to the communities it claims to represent. The author suggests that the influence of foundations on such advocacy groups and the policies they support, including affirmative action, may not be subject to adequate public scrutiny or debate. This perspective implies a skepticism of the foundations' roles in shaping policy agendas without direct accountability to a broader constituency."	0.02646	affirmative action	txt/408321836.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they recognize the need for measures to address historical racism and level the playing field, despite criticizing the extreme arguments from both sides of the debate.	"The text discusses the polarized debate over affirmative action in America, highlighting recent events such as the Supreme Court's decision not to review California's Proposition 209 and the controversy surrounding Bill Lann Lee's nomination. The author criticizes the extreme positions of both sides: one denying the existence of racial discrimination and the other accusing all opponents of affirmative action of racism. The author acknowledges that while blatant segregation has largely been overcome, racial fairness is still not a reality in many areas of society. The piece suggests that the debate is not about the goal of a fair society, but about the methods to achieve it, with some advocating for immediate colorblindness and others for measures to level the playing field due to historical racism.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They believe that most Americans desire fairness and do not celebrate the decrease in African American admissions at universities due to the ban on racial preferences. The author is critical of the simplistic arguments from both sides and suggests that the truth is complex, advocating for a more thoughtful and comprehensive approach to the issue. They seem to support the idea that some form of affirmative action, akin to breaking the mold in the case of black quarterbacks in the NFL, is necessary to create a society where individual merit, rather than race, determines success. The author concludes by noting the progress in the NFL as a positive sign of change, implying that similar approaches might be beneficial in broader society."	0.01956	affirmative action	txt/408345293.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text recounts the historic event of nine African American students, known as the Little Rock Nine, integrating Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, forty years prior. It mentions President Clinton's presence at the school to honor those individuals and introduces Fatima McKendra, an African American student body president, as an example of the progress made since then. The author reflects on their personal experiences with racial integration and the challenges they faced, including being barred from school activities and facing police action for participating in a sit-in. The author acknowledges that while there has been progress, such as the integration of various public services and the growth of the African American middle class, there are still issues of subtle racism and discrimination that need to be addressed. The text calls for a national conversation about race and emphasizes the importance of recognizing and honoring diversity, as well as ensuring equal opportunities for all Americans.

The author expresses a nuanced perspective on affirmative action and the state of racial issues in America. They recognize the significant strides that have been made since the days of overt segregation but also point out the current, more covert forms of racism that are still pervasive in society. The author is critical of the rollback of affirmative action policies, noting the negative impact on minority enrollment in state universities, and is wary of the rhetoric that perpetuates stereotypes. They advocate for a more inclusive society that honors the dignity of every person, suggesting that while laws can change institutions, changing people's hearts is a more complex challenge. The author calls for a national dialogue to foster understanding and respect across racial lines, emphasizing the need for both economic and educational opportunities to combat disparities that can be mistaken for racial discrimination. The overall perspective is one of cautious optimism, tempered with the recognition that there is much work to be done to achieve true equality and understanding."	0.021540000000000004	affirmative action	txt/408345486.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses Jennifer Gratz's lawsuit against the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, which she claims discriminated against her because she is white. The lawsuit poses a problem for supporters of affirmative action, as a victory for Gratz could lead to the dismantling of the program and a potential drop in minority enrollment, similar to what occurred in California and Texas. If Gratz loses, the case could be taken to the Supreme Court, which at the time seems to be against affirmative action. The university's admissions guidelines, which have since been changed, were seen as problematic because they instructed officers to treat minority applications differently, potentially violating the Supreme Court's decision in the Bakke case, which allows race to be a factor but not to the extent of excluding any candidate from full consideration.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is cautiously supportive but recognizes the complexities involved in such policies. They highlight that while the University of Michigan's original admissions guidelines were questionable, it is difficult to prove that race was the sole factor in any individual rejection, given the various criteria considered in college admissions. The author also mentions that the university gave preference to other groups, such as in-state students or children of alumni. They argue that even a program that complies with the Bakke decision will inevitably disadvantage some white applicants, implying that the existence of such ""victims"" does not automatically render the program unconstitutional. The text also criticizes the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's ruling in Hopwood v. Texas for prematurely disregarding the Supreme Court's stance on affirmative action and suggests that the Supreme Court may still consider race-conscious admissions constitutional under certain conditions, particularly within the unique environment of public universities."	0.018600000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408354994.xml.txt
	None	the text does not provide a clear indication of the author's perspective on affirmative action. the author's focus is on the potential impact of international agreements on domestic policies, including affirmative action, but there is no explicit support or opposition expressed towards affirmative action itself. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be categorized based on the information provided.	"The text discusses the increasing involvement of U.S. state and local governments in foreign policy, exemplified by Maryland state legislator Rushern L. Baker III's proposal to sanction companies doing business in Nigeria due to human rights abuses. U.S. State Department officials and trade representatives find themselves negotiating not only with foreign nations but also with American lawmakers like Baker, reflecting the deepening economic ties between the U.S. and other countries. The United States now addresses ""non-tariff barriers"" in trade talks, which include various regulations and societal norms of other countries that could affect U.S. exports. The Multilateral Agreement on Investments (MAI), a treaty under negotiation that aims to protect foreign investments, has sparked controversy and opposition, with critics like Lori Wallach and Ralph Nader arguing that it could undermine domestic governance and control over local laws. U.S. officials counter that existing laws would be protected and that the MAI would benefit American workers. However, the Clinton administration, wary from past trade negotiation challenges, is proceeding cautiously with the MAI.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as mentioned in the text, appears to be one of concern regarding its potential vulnerability under international agreements like the MAI. The author notes that critics of the MAI believe it could challenge domestic policies, including affirmative action, by restricting the ability of countries to enforce certain local laws. This implies that the author recognizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of affirmative action policies in the face of international treaties that could have unintended consequences on domestic social programs. The author's inclusion of affirmative action in the list of potentially affected policies suggests an awareness of its significance in the broader context of maintaining local control over laws that promote social equity."	0.02443	affirmative action	txt/408366163.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The provided text discusses the advancements made by African Americans in higher education over two decades, as detailed in a report titled ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education."" The report, authored by Michael T. Nettles, a University of Michigan professor, highlights significant increases in the number of African Americans obtaining baccalaureate degrees, with an estimated 89,000 graduates that year. The report notes growth across various types of institutions and regions, with the South showing the most substantial increase. Despite the progress, the report acknowledges ongoing challenges, such as the underrepresentation of African Americans in college enrollment and faculty positions, lower graduation rates compared to whites, and a gender disparity with African American women outnumbering men in undergraduate programs.

The author of the text appears to support affirmative action and recognizes the importance of acknowledging the progress made by African Americans in education. The author agrees with Nettles's positive outlook, emphasizing that understanding areas of success is crucial for continued advancement. The author also expresses concern about the male-female educational gap among African Americans, particularly the lower college-going rates for black men compared to women. This disparity is attributed to various factors, including greater job opportunities for black men immediately after high school. The author suggests that the root of this issue may lie in the educational experiences of young black males in public schools, where the gender gap is already evident. The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it is a necessary tool to build on the achievements made so far and to address the remaining challenges faced by African Americans in higher education."	0.02018	affirmative action	txt/408439658.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they criticize bradley's approach to race and suggest that affirmative action may exacerbate racial divisions.	"The text discusses the political landscape surrounding Bill Bradley and Al Gore as they navigate the pre-election period. It highlights Bradley's need to avoid overshadowing Gore, who is already facing difficulties, including his struggle to connect with voters and his controversial environmental stance. The author mentions Gore's peculiar claims, such as his assertion of a hard-scrabble farming past and his role in the development of the internet. The text also criticizes Gore's unwavering certainty and moral superiority, suggesting that he views those who disagree with him as not just wrong, but morally deficient. Bradley's speech on race is characterized as earnest but not novel, filled with calls for racial healing and candid talk. The author references Bradley's past critiques of other politicians on race issues and his tendency to attribute societal problems to Republican policies.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, suggesting that Bradley's approach to discussing race does not acknowledge the potential negative impact of identity politics and affirmative action. The author implies that Bradley's focus on race might actually hinder progress towards a society where race ""exists, but it doesn't matter,"" as envisioned by Toni Morrison. The author argues that Bradley's version of ""candid talk"" on race fails to recognize that affirmative action and the concept of categorical representation could be contributing to racial divisions, rather than helping to overcome them. The author believes that Bradley's stance on race and his perceived moral superiority could alienate voters who have honest differences of opinion on these sensitive issues."	0.02058	affirmative action	txt/408485014.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson critiqued Vice President Gore's establishment background as Gore announced his presidential campaign, highlighting a shift in political climate where establishment credentials are now seen as advantageous. The article discusses the decline of populism, which had been fueled by grievances toward establishment institutions since the late 1960s, and the rise of a national consensus that elites may be competently running America. This shift is attributed to the Clinton administration's policies and the strong U.S. economy. The author notes that despite Clinton's initial populist campaign, his tenure has made politics more favorable to educated experts and liberal special-interest groups. The article also mentions the role of polling in Clinton's political strategy, particularly in shaping his stance on affirmative action and tax cuts. The upcoming presidential race is expected to feature establishment figures like Gore and Bush, signaling the end of ""pork-rind politics.""

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author implies a critical view of the way elites, including President Clinton, have handled affirmative action. Clinton's policy of ""mend it, don't end it"" is presented as a calculated move to quell populist discontent while maintaining control over the issue. The author suggests that Clinton's approach to affirmative action, informed by extensive polling, represents a surgical accommodation of public opinion rather than a genuine populist sentiment. This method allows elites to dictate the terms of the policy, which the author views as an elitist premise. The frustration expressed by proponents of more significant tax cuts mirrors the tension around affirmative action, where the government's role in directing social policies is questioned. The author's perspective indicates skepticism toward the elite's management of affirmative action, viewing it as a strategic move to maintain power rather than a reflection of populist will."	0.03122	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but they seem to be neutral or somewhat in favor, as they recognize the complexities within conservative attitudes towards race and do not overtly criticize affirmative action. they suggest that some conservatives may support black candidates who oppose affirmative action, but they do not directly endorse or oppose the policy themselves.	"The text discusses the author's observations and reflections on the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes, a black candidate, during a presidential race. The author notes Keyes' surprising performance in the Iowa caucuses and questions whether white voters can truly look beyond a black candidate's race. The author points out the dichotomy between black and white Americans' perspectives on this issue, with black Americans doubting white voters' ability to ignore race, while white voters believe they have moved past such considerations, citing examples of black politicians elected by predominantly white electorates. The author recalls a televised interview where white conservatives seemed to support Keyes based on issues rather than race, and reflects on Strom Thurmond's support for Clarence Thomas, suggesting that some conservatives may indeed be able to prioritize political philosophy over race.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is implicit in their discussion of conservative views on race and politics. The author suggests that white conservatives are able to support black candidates like Keyes when their political views align, particularly when those candidates oppose policies like affirmative action, which some conservatives view negatively. The author indicates that this support seems to disregard the general sentiments of the black voter base, implying that such conservatives may only be able to overlook race when the black candidate in question shares their disdain for affirmative action and other government initiatives. The author challenges the notion that conservatism must inherently be linked to racism, proposing that the ability of some conservatives to support black candidates based on shared philosophy could be a positive sign, and that those who seek racial justice may need to recognize and possibly celebrate the complexities within conservative attitudes towards race."	0.0204	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author seems somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they express concern over the potential rollback of policies supporting marginalized communities and emphasize the importance of inclusion and diversity in government appointments.	"The text discusses the importance of U.S. presidential candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, revealing their potential administration members before the election. The author argues that knowing who will fill Cabinet and other high-level positions is crucial for voters, as these individuals will significantly influence national policy and priorities. The piece mentions Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as possible members of Bush's team but notes the general lack of information about both candidates' potential appointees. The author urges both Gore and Bush to disclose their teams to reflect their campaign promises of inclusion and diversity, and to allow voters to make more informed decisions.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it is a critical issue for voters, particularly those of color, who have historically supported the Democratic Party due to its stance on civil rights and diversity in government appointments. The author implies that with the Democratic Leadership Council's rise to prominence within the party, there is a concern that a Gore administration might roll back on affirmative action and other policies aimed at supporting marginalized communities. By calling for transparency in the selection of future Cabinet members and advisers, the author suggests that voters need reassurance that the progress made in these areas will continue, and that the principles of inclusion touted during campaigns will be reflected in the actual governance."	0.022140000000000003	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author appears to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, focusing instead on the political dynamics and lieberman's alignment with the democratic party rather than expressing a clear stance on the policy itself.	"Joseph Lieberman introduced himself to the American public, emphasizing his embodiment of the American dream and his commitment to values such as faith, family, hard work, public service, and equal opportunity. His speech at the convention was well-received, but it also highlighted the tension between his reputation for integrity and innovative thinking and the traditional stances of the Democratic Party. Lieberman sought to align himself with mainstream Democratic views, focusing on areas of agreement with Al Gore like health care and environmental issues, while avoiding more contentious topics such as his past criticisms of President Clinton and his support for policies like tort reform and school vouchers.

The author presents Lieberman as someone who has previously been open about the complexities of issues like affirmative action and the shortcomings of public education. However, during his speech, Lieberman chose to align more closely with the Democratic Party's platform, endorsing affirmative action despite having questioned it in the past. The author suggests that Lieberman's past willingness to diverge from party lines raises questions about whether the Gore-Lieberman ticket can introduce new ideas without alienating core Democratic constituents. The author also touches on the Democratic Party's success in maintaining the presidency by adapting their positions and incorporating new management styles and competition, such as support for charter schools. The author seems to advocate for the preservation of this openness and flexibility within the party, as exemplified by Jesse Jackson's call for the ability to change, challenge, and agree to disagree."	0.018770000000000002	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, as they express concerns about john ashcroft's opposition to bill lann lee's nomination based on lee's beliefs about affirmative action, suggesting a skepticism about the policy's impact on impartiality in legal roles.	"The text discusses the nomination of John Ashcroft for the position of attorney general and the controversy surrounding it. While Ashcroft's supporters argue that he is qualified and would enforce the law fairly, the author points out that the role of attorney general involves setting law enforcement policy and deciding how to prioritize and enforce various laws. The author questions what it means to enforce laws ""fairly"" and emphasizes that Ashcroft's record shows he has advocated for positions that are far from the political mainstream on issues such as gun control, abortion, juvenile justice, and the death penalty. The author also mentions Ashcroft's response to a question about potentially undermining the Roe v. Wade decision, interpreting it as an acknowledgment that he could let his personal views influence his legal decisions.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a contentious topic that played a role in a past confirmation battle involving Ashcroft. When Bill Lann Lee was nominated by President Clinton to lead the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft opposed Lee's appointment based on his beliefs about affirmative action. Ashcroft argued that Lee's views on affirmative action would prevent him from having a balanced perspective necessary for the job. The author suggests that the same logic could apply to Ashcroft himself, implying that Ashcroft's personal and religious views could similarly affect his ability to serve impartially as attorney general. The author's stance indicates a concern that Ashcroft's ideological leanings, particularly his conservative views, could unduly influence his enforcement of the law and shaping of legal policy, mirroring the concerns Ashcroft had about Lee's stance on affirmative action."	0.01991	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is neutral.	"The Bush administration faced criticism for rescinding a Clinton-era regulation that reduced arsenic levels in drinking water. Jonathan Adler, a former senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, believed that the administration should have easily defended its decision based on the merits of the issue. However, he attributed the backlash to poor communication and the incompetence of environmental journalists. Despite the fact that a federal arsenic regulation was still in place, environmental groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, argued that the facts did not support the Bush administration's stance. Adler humorously suggested renaming arsenic to something less alarming to help industry groups in their public relations battle.

Regarding affirmative action, the text indicates that the Bush administration claims not to practice it. However, the administration's record shows that 40 percent of its top-tier position announcements requiring Senate confirmation were women and minorities. This is a higher percentage than the previous Clinton administration, which had 37 percent women and 15 percent African Americans, and significantly higher than the Reagan administration's 10 percent women and 8 percent African American. The author seems to present these statistics to highlight the diversity within the Bush administration's appointments, which may be seen as an implicit form of affirmative action, despite official claims to the contrary. The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but the inclusion of these statistics suggests a recognition of the administration's efforts towards diversity in its appointments."	0.01854	affirmative action	txt/409076441.xml.txt
	None	the author does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action but rather comments on the conservative perspective and their inconsistent application of judicial philosophy when it comes to affirmative action. the author's focus is on the critique of the conservative approach, not on affirmative action itself. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the provided text.	"The provided text is a critical examination of the conservative approach to the ""advice and consent"" clause of the U.S. Constitution regarding judicial nominations. The author argues that conservatives interpret this clause strictly, except when it is politically inconvenient for them. They believe that senators should not consider a nominee's political ideology, but rather their judicial philosophy, which conservatives often define with terms like ""judicial restraint"" and ""original intent."" However, the author points out that conservatives themselves do not always adhere to these principles, particularly in cases like affirmative action, where they support judicial activism to overturn policies made by elected branches.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is an example of conservatives' selective application of their judicial philosophy. While they generally advocate for ""judicial restraint"" and adhering to the ""original intent"" of the Constitution, conservatives encourage judges to use the Constitution to actively dismantle affirmative action policies established by the legislative and executive branches. The author suggests that this inconsistency reveals that conservative buzzwords and principles are not as infallible or universally applicable as they are presented to be. The author implies that conservatives are willing to abandon their stated principles when it serves their political interests, such as in the case of affirmative action, where their goal is to have judges intervene and overturn these policies despite their usual stance against judicial activism."	0.022460000000000004	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author is neutral on affirmative action, as their focus is on the political strategy behind its use rather than expressing a personal stance on the policy itself.	"The text provided by the user is a commentary on President George W. Bush's political acumen and public perception. The author outlines several reasons for Bush's favorable public opinion, including low expectations, a comparison to his predecessor, his charm, and a focused agenda. However, the author argues that Bush's success is also due to his political intelligence, which is distinct from verbal intelligence. The author admits to previously underestimating Bush's intelligence and mistakenly considering him unintelligent due to his lack of verbal prowess. Bush's understanding of political dynamics, specifically the concept of triangulation, is highlighted as a key to his success. This strategy involves satisfying one's core supporters, neutralizing opposition, and appealing to swing voters. The author compares Bush's approach to that of former President Bill Clinton, noting similarities in their tactics to win over the electorate.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is seen as a strategic political tool rather than a moral imperative. The author describes how Bill Clinton firmly supported affirmative action as one of the ""nonnegotiables"" for his core constituency, suggesting that this was a calculated move to secure the support of his base while allowing flexibility on other issues to attract swing voters. Similarly, Bush's stance on racial profiling is presented as a strategic decision to weaken his opposition and appeal to swing voters without alienating his core supporters. The author implies that both Clinton and Bush used issues like affirmative action and racial profiling to their political advantage, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of their electorate's priorities and concerns. The commentary suggests that the author views affirmative action through the lens of political strategy rather than as a policy primarily evaluated on its social justice merits."	0.02069	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, as they highlight a concern with the lack of ideological diversity in academia and suggest that support for policies like affirmative action is almost a prerequisite in certain fields, which contributes to a filtering process that excludes conservative viewpoints.	"The text is a commentary on the political imbalance within academia, highlighting that studies have found a significant outnumbering of Republicans by Democrats among professors, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. The imbalance has increased over time, with younger professors tending to be more uniformly liberal than their retiring older colleagues. The article cites studies of voter registration records that show a lopsided ratio of Democrats to Republicans at prestigious universities like Berkeley and Stanford. It also references financial contributions from university employees to presidential candidates, showing a strong preference for Democratic candidates. The author mentions George Lakoff's denial of institutional bias, attributing the hiring disparity to conservatives' lack of interest in academia. Mark Bauerlein's essay is cited, discussing the filtering processes that exclude conservatives and the embedded political orientations in academic scholarship definitions.

The author's perspective on affirmative action and political diversity in academia is critical. They suggest that there is an implicit bias against conservative viewpoints within academia, which is evident in the way certain fields define scholarship and exclude those who disagree with prevailing liberal perspectives. This is particularly noted in disciplines like African-American studies and women's studies, where support for policies like affirmative action is almost a prerequisite. The author portrays the academic environment as a ""sheltered habitat"" that fosters a ""false consensus effect,"" leading to extreme polarization and insularity of beliefs. They argue that academia has become less influential in political discourse due to its political one-sidedness and lack of ideological diversity, despite its vocal commitment to diversity in other areas. This monolithic intellectual culture, the author suggests, undermines the credibility and relevance of academic institutions in broader societal debates."	0.021540000000000004	affirmative action	txt/409707034.xml.txt

Rehnquist's diagnosis with thyroid cancer. The court's tradition of privacy in personal matters is contrasted with the public's right to know, given the Supreme Court's influence on policymaking. Experts and former officials provide differing opinions on whether the Chief Justice should disclose more information about his health. The second issue is Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's influence on the court, as a study in the North Carolina Law Review quantifies her ideological leanings and identifies her as the ""median voter"" who has shifted towards the left over the years. This shift has implications for the court's rulings, including the narrow approval of affirmative action in college admissions in 2003, where O'Connor's vote was pivotal.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is portrayed as a policy area where the Supreme Court, and particularly Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, plays a critical role. The author notes that O'Connor's ideological shift to the left was instrumental in the court's 5-4 decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions in 2003. The study mentioned suggests that without O'Connor's evolution, the likelihood of the court approving affirmative action would have been small before 2001. This suggests that the author views individual justices, especially those in the ideological center like O'Connor, as having significant sway over the court's decisions on contentious issues such as affirmative action. The author seems to imply that the court's dynamics and the justices' personal leanings are crucial to understanding the direction of U.S. jurisprudence on such matters."	0.01989	affirmative action	txt/409718670.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not clearly stated in the summary provided. the text focuses on the broader issue of political attacks on the judiciary and the importance of judicial independence, rather than on affirmative action specifically. therefore, it is not possible to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action based on the given summary.	"Summary:
The article discusses the increasing threats and political attacks on judges in the United States, a situation exacerbated by high-profile cases like that of Terri Schiavo. The author notes that both liberals and conservatives are using the judiciary to settle political disputes, which has led to a personalization of the judiciary and a disregard for judicial independence. The involvement of Congress and the President in trying to overrule judicial decisions, such as in the Schiavo case, has contributed to a toxic environment. The article also mentions the historical context of judicial attacks and the current trend of judge-bashing from both sides of the political spectrum. The author suggests that judges should resist these pressures by following the law, avoiding grandiose assertions of judicial power, and staying out of the public spotlight.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jeffrey Rosen, appears to have a moderate perspective on the role of the judiciary in controversial issues such as affirmative action. He references the book ""A Court Divided"" by Mark Tushnet, which argues that the Rehnquist court's decisions on affirmative action, gay rights, and access to early-term abortions have generally aligned with the views of a narrow majority of Americans. This suggests that Rosen believes the judiciary has been reflective rather than obstructive of the public will in such matters. He criticizes the political characterization of judges as elitist or anti-democratic, indicating that he sees the judiciary as an essential part of a functioning democracy that should not be swayed by extreme interest groups. Rosen seems to advocate for a judiciary that interprets the law impartially without succumbing to political pressures or personal attacks, which would include a balanced approach to affirmative action and other divisive issues."	0.02936	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not discussed in the summary provided.	"Summary:
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, asserts that Medicare and Medicaid pose greater budgetary concerns than Social Security. However, Social Security, Terri Schiavo's case, and judicial nominations have gained prominence in Washington, not solely due to political leaders but because of well-established interest groups that have been pushing these issues for years. These groups, such as AARP, the Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, influence public discourse and political agendas. The National Federation of Independent Business, for example, has effectively promoted its priorities, such as the repeal of the inheritance tax. Interest groups have become more influential than political parties in setting agendas and supporting candidates, often through persistent lobbying efforts. Social Security has remained a key issue due to the efforts of organizations like AARP, while other critical issues like Medicaid do not receive the same attention due to a lack of organized advocacy. The article suggests that while interest groups can significantly impact policy, not all important issues have the backing of powerful organizations, leaving many concerns unaddressed.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Jeffrey Birnbaum, does not explicitly discuss affirmative action in the provided text. However, he does mention that affirmative action is one of the divisive issues wrapped up in the broader political battles being fought by interest groups in Washington. The context suggests that, like other contentious topics, affirmative action is subject to the influence of organized interests that can mobilize support and sway public policy. Birnbaum's broader perspective seems to be that the power dynamics in Washington are heavily influenced by the actions and persistence of these groups, which can elevate certain issues to the forefront of the political agenda, including affirmative action, depending on their resources and ability to engage supporters. The author implies that the fate of such issues often depends less on the intrinsic merits of the policies and more on the strategic efforts of well-entrenched lobbying organizations."	0.034780000000000005	affirmative action	txt/409936292.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text provides an overview of Tel Aviv's history and cultural landscape. It begins with the ancient roots of the neighboring port city of Jaffa, before transitioning to the late 19th-century expansion that led to the creation of Tel Aviv. The city is described as a modern Jewish city, celebrating its centennial and evolving from a point of arrival for Zionist immigrants to a vibrant cultural and financial hub. Despite its bohemian and tolerant streak, Tel Aviv is not without controversy, as some see its lifestyle as detached from the conflicts that characterize other Israeli cities like Jerusalem. The city has experienced violence, but also cultural growth, with a focus on preserving its Bauhaus architecture. Rising property values and the potential gentrification of Arab neighborhoods are concerns, and affirmative action policies are in place to help Israeli Arabs. The narrative concludes by contrasting Tel Aviv's lively nightlife with the more conservative observance of the Sabbath in other cities.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action in Tel Aviv is seen as a necessary but perhaps insufficient measure to address the inequalities faced by the city's Arab citizens. The author notes that Tel Aviv has affirmative action policies for hiring Israeli Arabs, indicating an awareness and an attempt to address systemic disparities. However, the mention of the Arab mayoral candidate's poor election performance and the concerns about gentrification in Arab neighborhoods suggest that affirmative action alone may not be enough to overcome the deep-seated challenges in achieving true equality and integration. The author highlights the city's liberal and secular identity, as well as its efforts to be inclusive and tolerant towards minorities, including the LGBTQ+ community, but also hints at underlying tensions and the complexity of fully realizing these ideals."	0.02485	affirmative action	txt/410325615.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, given the mention of ralph reed's opposition to mainstream civil rights leaders on issues such as affirmative action. however, the text also acknowledges the efforts to address racial inequalities, which suggests the author is not entirely dismissive of the underlying goals of affirmative action.	"The text discusses Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, and his efforts to bridge the gap between white conservatives and African-American communities. Reed, who has opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on issues such as affirmative action and welfare reform, is now advocating for white Christian conservatives to acknowledge and make amends for their historical role in perpetuating racial injustice. The Christian Coalition has launched the Samaritan Project, led by African-American Rev. Earl Jackson, aiming to revitalize low-income, inner-city neighborhoods through multiracial partnerships with local churches, particularly those aiding at-risk youths. The coalition has raised funds for this cause and plans to host a conference in Baltimore to discuss racial justice and cooperation across racial and cultural lines.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of Reed's previous opposition to it, noting the irony in Reed's current efforts to address racial inequalities. While acknowledging Reed's past stance against mainstream civil rights initiatives, the author seems cautiously optimistic about the potential of the Samaritan Project to foster racial reconciliation and bring attention to the work of black churches. The author suggests that the Christian Coalition's involvement could help black churches feel less isolated and draw public attention to their efforts. However, there is also a hint of skepticism, as the author mentions the possibility that conservatives may be using the project to gain moral authority and political clout, as well as to garner black support for policies typically opposed by liberal leaders. The text ends on a hopeful note, welcoming the competition for black support between conservatives and liberals and the leading role of churches in racial reconciliation."	0.02084	affirmative action	txt/418239486.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses Mayor Richard Daley's new strategy for promoting sergeants within the Chicago Police Department to better reflect the city's ethnic and racial diversity. The plan involves selecting 70% of new sergeants based on written test results and 30% on job performance, with an aim for racial and ethnic balance. The approach has received criticism from police union bosses, who argue it could reintroduce political cronyism, and from the African-American Police League, which feels the initiative implies that special measures are necessary for black sergeants to qualify and claims the written test is racially biased. The text also mentions the possibility of judicial review, as courts have been critical of race-based systems, but suggests that a diverse police force is essential for the city.

The author appears to support affirmative action as a means to create a police force that mirrors the city's diversity, viewing it as beneficial for effective community policing. They commend Mayor Daley for his initiative, despite the backlash, and argue that job performance is an important factor in promotions, which should be considered beyond the 30% Daley has proposed. The author acknowledges the potential for the system to be misused but believes the plan is a step in the right direction and deserves support. They also differentiate between affirmative action quotas and the practical need for a diverse police force, suggesting that a wise judge should recognize the difference and uphold Daley's plan."	0.015240000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418249271.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be somewhat in favor, as they express concern about the consequences of banning affirmative action policies, particularly highlighting the low admission rates of black students at uc berkeley's law school.	"The New Yorker reported on the well-attended memorial service for Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, contrasting it with the sparsely attended funeral of her husband in 1965. Shabazz, who pursued an accomplished life as an academic and civil rights advocate, is seen as a symbol of the ongoing struggles within the black community regarding integration and the political legacy of Malcolm X. The article also reflects on the broader issues of racial inequality and separatism in the aftermath of the civil rights era. Furthermore, the piece touches on the potential impact of the University of California's ban on affirmative action, noting that only one black student was admitted to the incoming class at UC Berkeley's law school.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be one of concern, especially in light of the recent developments at the University of California. The low number of black students in the incoming law school class is presented as a troubling sign of the policy's consequences. The authors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hendrik Hertzberg, seem to suggest that while there is a consensus among the black community for integrated workplaces and a recognition that not all issues faced by black Americans are due to white racism, the lack of affirmative action may hinder the progress and hopes for greater roles in society for black individuals. The authors conclude with a poignant reflection on the shift from inequality leading to separateness during the civil rights era to separateness being a result of persistent inequality, indicating a complex and ongoing challenge in achieving racial equity."	0.01695	affirmative action	txt/418395424.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action. while they support free speech and the discussion of affirmative action, they criticize the way graglia presented his argument and suggest that affirmative action policies may not fully address the underlying issues of minority underachievement.	"Summary:
Law Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas at Austin made controversial statements suggesting that Blacks and Mexican-Americans are not as academically competitive as whites in selective institutions due to a culture that does not encourage achievement. His comments sparked outrage, leading politicians and colleagues to criticize him and students to call for his dismissal. However, the author argues that while Graglia's delivery was flawed and potentially offensive, his underlying concerns about minority underachievement have been previously noted by scholars like Thomas Sowell. The author emphasizes the importance of free speech and dialogue in addressing public policy issues, including affirmative action, and suggests that socioeconomic factors and historical discrimination should be considered when discussing minority achievement.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to support the right to openly discuss and oppose affirmative action, as exemplified by Graglia's stance, but criticizes Graglia for implying that minority underachievement is a fixed trait rather than considering external factors such as socioeconomic status and historical discrimination. The author points to the success of Italian-Americans over time despite initial prejudice and discrimination, suggesting that similar progress is possible for Hispanics and Blacks. The author advocates for a more nuanced and educational dialogue on race and affirmative action, rather than outright condemnation of differing viewpoints. The author also implies that President Clinton's administration lacks nuance in its approach to race-related issues. Overall, the author promotes tolerance and a comprehensive discussion on affirmative action that acknowledges the complexities of race, poverty, and historical context in America."	0.019870000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, particularly in the context of college admissions and the use of standardized testing like the sat.	"The text criticizes the approach of the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California, which proposed eliminating the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) as a remedy for the expected drop in Latino enrollment following the end of racial preferences in admissions. The author argues that the task force's solution does not address the underlying issue of poor academic performance among Hispanic applicants but instead suggests removing a tool that highlights this performance gap. The text also addresses the criticism of the SAT, such as claims of cultural bias and that it only reflects family income, countering with examples and data that suggest otherwise. The author suggests that better primary and secondary education for black and Hispanic students is the solution, not the elimination of standardized tests like the SAT.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action policies that lower admission standards for certain racial groups can be detrimental, as they may place students in educational environments for which they are not adequately prepared. The author emphasizes the importance of improving the quality of education in grade schools and high schools for black and Hispanic students, rather than relying on affirmative action in college admissions. The author suggests that the SAT is a necessary measure to compare students from different educational backgrounds fairly and that the decline in minority enrollment in the University of California system reflects the inadequacies of their earlier education, not the unfairness of the SAT. The author's stance is that affirmative action should not be used to compensate for these inadequacies and that doing so could lead to increased failure rates among minority students who are admitted to colleges for which they are not prepared."	0.02055	affirmative action	txt/418468651.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses a study titled ""Job Training Experiences of Black and Women, 1970-1991,"" which examines the participation of black and white women in job training programs over two decades. It reveals that while the participation rate doubled for both groups, white women were more likely to be involved in managerial and professional training. In the 1970s, black women were overrepresented in clerical and semiskilled programs and underrepresented in managerial and professional training. However, by the 1980s, the segregation in job training types diminished, but overall participation of black women in training programs decreased compared to white women. The study also found that with maturity, job training led to higher wages regardless of program duration, educational level, or work history.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, emphasizing its importance in addressing historical inequalities in job training access between black and white women. They advocate for expanding job training opportunities rather than limiting access for some groups. Affirmative action programs, according to the authors, can help businesses attract a diverse and qualified workforce and represent an investment in human capital with benefits for both employees and employers. The authors encourage proactive efforts by black women to ensure access to job training programs that align with their aspirations and abilities. They also stress the importance of mentoring, continuing education, and the need for businesses to adapt by offering training that meets changing job requirements. The authors argue that such measures can help overcome job segregation and underrepresentation of black women in managerial positions, ultimately benefiting organizations by not wasting talent."	0.021410000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418520188.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the efforts of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago to integrate the city's police and fire departments by promoting more black and Hispanic officers. Despite his efforts, he faces opposition from the police and fire unions. The police union has run misleading radio ads against the use of affirmative action in promotions, while the fire union resisted similar measures for over 32 months. The fire union eventually agreed to consider job performance for a small percentage of promotions, but only after the city consented to pay the salaries of top union officers. The author notes that the fire union has no minority representation on its governing board and grants full voting rights to predominantly white retired members. The Daley administration is portrayed as working to create a more racially and ethnically representative police and fire service, despite resistance from the unions. The author also suggests that black and Hispanic police and firefighters who feel progress is too slow should become more active and organized within their unions.

From the author's perspective, Mayor Daley is making a commendable effort to address historical injustices in the police and fire departments by promoting diversity through affirmative action. The author compares Daley to Abraham Lincoln, implying that his actions are progressive and courageous, especially in the face of the unions' resistance. The criticism of the unions, with their discriminatory practices and resistance to change, is stark, painting them as the antagonists to Daley's efforts. The author implies that the unions' actions, and the opposition from some black and Hispanic members of the police and fire departments, only serve to highlight the mayor's balanced approach. The author's stance indicates a belief that affirmative action is a necessary tool for achieving racial and ethnic equity in public service positions and that the mayor's strategy in implementing it is appropriate and just."	0.017	affirmative action	txt/418548792.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. the focus is on reparations for historical injustices rather than on affirmative action policies. therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given summary.	"Summary:
The text discusses a historic moment where the U.S. government agreed to pay reparations to African-American farmers for past racial discrimination by the USDA. A federal judge approved a settlement from a 1997 class-action lawsuit, which requires the USDA to pay at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who were denied loans and assistance due to their race. The settlement also includes the return of foreclosed lands to the affected farmers. The number of African-American farmers has drastically decreased from 14 percent in 1920 to less than 1 percent, a decline attributed to discriminatory practices by the USDA. The total claims are expected to exceed $375 million, but some farmers feel the settlement is insufficient. The lawsuit and the settlement are seen as a step towards addressing the broader issue of reparations for African-Americans for historical injustices, including slavery and segregation.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view reparations as a more logical and morally responsible approach to addressing historical racial injustices compared to affirmative action and other preference policies. The text suggests that reparations, spread throughout the tax system, offer a way to address the economic and cultural disadvantages faced by African-Americans due to a history of government-approved racial bias. This approach is seen as providing a clear rationale for compensating African-Americans as a class, separate from the contentious debates surrounding affirmative action. The author draws parallels with Germany's reparations to Israel for the Holocaust, implying that reparations can be a widely accepted method of redressing past harms when there is a sense of moral responsibility. The piece also notes the irony that President Bill Clinton, the second president to be impeached, played a role in resuming the experiment in reparations that was halted after the Reconstruction era. Overall, the author seems to advocate for reparations as a justified and necessary means of rectifying the historical injustices faced by African-Americans."	0.02311	affirmative action	txt/418768610.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text criticizes the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, particularly its leadership under President William Kugelman, for proposing a new contract that is perceived as regressive, particularly in terms of racial equality. The union's initial offer is seen as an attempt to undermine affirmative action efforts within the fire department by eliminating ""merit"" promotions, which have helped advance some black and Hispanic firefighters. Additionally, the union's demand for a significant pay increase and changes to work rules is considered excessive, but the primary concern is the attempt to roll back progress on racial diversity. The author urges Mayor Richard Daley to reject these proposals and instead implement reforms to end what is described as racist behavior within the department, suggesting that the union's actions have made it clear that significant changes are necessary.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is highly supportive, viewing it as a necessary tool for creating a fire service command structure that reflects the diversity of Chicago. The text expresses disdain for the union's opposition to these policies, particularly under the leadership of Kugelman, who is characterized as a long-time adversary of affirmative action. The author believes that the union's contract proposals are not just in poor taste but are actively harmful attempts to reverse the progress made in promoting racial equality within the fire department. The mention of the union's request for additional paid holidays, especially Bud Billiken Day, is seen as a mocking gesture towards the African American community. The author advocates for Mayor Daley to take a firm stance against the union's regressive proposals and to promote reforms that would eliminate discriminatory practices and attitudes, thereby strengthening the commitment to affirmative action and diversity."	0.015150000000000002	affirmative action	txt/418950637.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not provided in the summary.	"The text discusses how the Internet can be used to assist voters in making informed decisions for the presidential election through websites like selectsmart.com and presidentmatch.com. These websites offer questionnaires that match users with candidates based on their political views on various national issues such as abortion, crime, defense, and affirmative action. The author filled out a questionnaire and shared the results, which indicated a strong match with Libertarian candidate Harry Browne, followed by other candidates like Alan Keyes, Orrin Hatch, and George W. Bush. The author also noted the limitations of these online tools, such as their neglect of certain important issues and personal qualities of candidates, and the potential for misleading results if taken too seriously.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the mention of affirmative action as one of the issues included in the questionnaire suggests that it is among the factors considered significant in the political landscape and candidate selection process. The author seems to value the idea of matching voters with candidates based on policy positions, which implies a belief in the importance of voters' stances on key issues, including affirmative action, when choosing a candidate. While the author does not express a personal opinion on affirmative action, they highlight the usefulness of these quizzes in helping voters align with candidates who represent their policy preferences, suggesting a pragmatic approach to political decision-making."	0.019600000000000003	affirmative action	txt/419118450.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, given their support for clarence thomas' views, which are known to be critical of affirmative action policies.	"The text is a commentary on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' speech at an American Enterprise Institute dinner event. The author contrasts their own positive perception of Thomas' speech with the negative review written by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. While Dowd characterized the speech as ""bellicose,"" ""self-pitying,"" and ""self-aggrandizing,"" the author found it inspiring and focused on ""duty, honor, country."" The author notes that the audience was engaged throughout the speech and gave Thomas a spontaneous standing ovation. The author also defends Thomas' courage to speak his truth despite expecting negative reactions, especially on controversial topics like affirmative action, school busing, and welfare.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, seems critical of the conventional approach to the issue. The author appears to support Clarence Thomas' position, which is one of questioning the status quo regarding affirmative action and other policies aimed at addressing racial disparities. The author suggests that Thomas, as a black man, has faced harsh criticism for his views, which challenge the accepted wisdom on such matters. The author emphasizes the need for courage to engage in meaningful debate and to stand by one's convictions, even in the face of personal attacks and societal pressure. The author admires Thomas for his willingness to engage in these difficult discussions and to resist the intimidation that can come with opposing popular opinion on sensitive topics."	0.01797	affirmative action	txt/419426239.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The provided text discusses the heightened awareness of diversity in America following the events of September 11th. The nation's collective identity and its rich variety of backgrounds became more pronounced as people sought to understand and empathize with one another across different races, religions, and ethnicities. College campuses saw an increased interest in courses about the Middle East, international relations, and related languages, reflecting a desire to engage with a broader range of perspectives. The text also delves into the ongoing debate about affirmative action in university admissions, highlighting conflicting court rulings on whether race and ethnicity should be considered to promote diversity. The ""diversity rationale"" has replaced the previous standard of remedying past racial discrimination and is seen as a positive educational goal. The issue is particularly relevant to flagship public universities and may impact private institutions depending on the legal standards set.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, seeing it as an essential component of higher education that enables students to experience and learn from diversity. They argue that diversity is not only about different ideas but also about the invaluable direct encounters with individuals who are different from ourselves. These encounters challenge both the heart and mind and are irreplaceable in the educational context. The author questions the idea that merit should be determined solely by test scores and grades, suggesting that merit can take many forms and that context matters in evaluating achievement. They also reference studies indicating that affirmative action beneficiaries can perform well and even better at top schools compared to their counterparts at less-selective institutions. The author echoes the sentiments of University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor, who emphasizes the importance of seeing the world from different perspectives and the unique opportunity college provides to interact in a diverse environment. The text concludes by rejecting the notion that a diverse range of ideas can exist without a diverse student body, stressing the importance of personal encounters with diversity in an educational setting."	0.022600000000000002	affirmative action	txt/419493718.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, particularly due to the negative connotations associated with the fraudulent exploitation of these policies as described in the text.	"The text describes the unfolding situation in Chicago where close friends of the mayor, connected to the Chicago Outfit, are about to be indicted for a $100 million affirmative-action contract fraud scheme. The author, while waiting for the U.S. Attorney's press conference, decides to have lunch at Gene & Georgetti's, a steakhouse popular with politicians and insiders, and a favorite of the Duffs (the family facing indictment). The author reflects on the history of the Duffs' connections with the mayor, the Tribune's investigative reporting on the matter, and the discrepancies in media scrutiny compared to past scandals involving different racial dynamics. The piece ends with the author and friends discussing the significance of an independent federal prosecutor and receiving news of the Duff indictments at the steakhouse.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears critical, particularly in the context of its exploitation for fraudulent purposes. They highlight the Duffs' abuse of city contracts intended for minority or women-owned businesses, emphasizing the corruption and cronyism that has allowed white individuals with political connections to unjustly benefit from affirmative action policies. The author also contrasts the media's treatment of this scandal with past incidents, suggesting a racial bias in the intensity of scrutiny and public pressure. Moreover, the author underscores the importance of holding powerful figures accountable, regardless of their connections, and endorses the role of an independent federal prosecutor in ensuring justice is served, illustrating a broader concern for integrity in the application of affirmative action and other government programs."	0.02143	affirmative action	txt/419989695.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the issue of racism within the Chicago Fire Department, highlighting the recent incidents of racist radio transmissions and the department's history of racial tension since its integration in 1968. The author expresses outrage over the fact that tax dollars fund the equipment and salaries associated with such bigotry. The article references a 1990 incident where firefighters engaged in racist behavior at a party, and notes that the current president of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union Local 2, James McNally, once protested affirmative action in a derogatory manner. The author argues that these behaviors are intolerable and that the department's leadership has committed to taking serious action, including potential dismissal, against those responsible. The difficulty of identifying the culprits is acknowledged, especially considering the possibility of outside interference, but the author insists that the integrity of the fire service must be restored and that those who cannot respect the diverse community they serve should leave the profession.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a necessary measure to ensure fairness within the fire department, despite the resentment it may cause among some who feel disadvantaged by the promotion of minorities. The author views affirmative action as a corrective to a long-standing culture within the department that valued skill, courage, and clout but overlooked fairness. The author criticizes the mindset that opposes affirmative action and finds it unacceptable for any firefighter to express their frustrations through bigotry. The text suggests that firefighters who do not harbor such bigotry have a responsibility to lead the department away from its troubled past and to uphold the principle of public service by identifying and condemning those responsible for the racist incidents. The author supports the fire commissioner's stance on dealing with the incidents and emphasizes the importance of due process in handling the offenders, echoing the mayor's sentiment that those who disrespect the community have no place in the fire service."	0.02389	affirmative action	txt/420033919.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author appears to be somewhat against affirmative action, particularly due to the perception of its use as a tool for political maneuvering and the potential for abuse, as indicated by the context of the duffs' trial.	"The text discusses the retirement of Chicago's white Fire Commissioner James Joyce and the appointment of Cortez Trotter, a black man, as his replacement. Trotter's background is in the paramedic side of the department rather than firefighting, which is a notable change in leadership. The author mentions that Trotter's appointment is historic not only because he is the first black man to lead the predominantly white department but also because of his paramedic background. Mayor Richard Daley insists that the decision to appoint Trotter was based on qualifications, not politics or symbolism. Trotter emphasizes the importance of diversity and warns against any discriminatory behavior within the department. The author also points out that the Chicago Fire Department has traditionally been a domain for white men and suggests that the appointment is a strategic move by Daley to cover his political interests, especially in light of an upcoming trial involving his friends, the Duffs, who are charged with fraudulently obtaining affirmative action contracts.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and skeptical, particularly in the context of political maneuvering. He implies that Mayor Daley's decision to appoint Trotter may be more about political optics than genuine commitment to diversity, given the timing with the Duffs' trial. The trial involves white individuals exploiting affirmative action contracts for their benefit, which the author sees as theft from minority and female-owned businesses. This casts a shadow on the sincerity of affirmative action policies when they can be manipulated for personal gain. The author also notes that Trotter, as a black man, has decided to push affirmative-action policies in a department with a union that opposes racial preferences, highlighting the contentious and political nature of affirmative action within the department. Trotter's success in his role will depend on navigating these complex political and social dynamics, suggesting that the author views affirmative action as a challenging and often politicized issue."	0.022590000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420116341.xml.txt

"The text is a report about a phone conversation with Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb, who was the former purchasing agent for Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. Grzyb claims he has no knowledge of the dealings between the Duffs, Waste Management, and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall. The author also criticizes the lack of media attention to the story, especially TV news, due to the absence of exciting visuals. The federal prosecutors have released documents alleging that the Duffs, who are white and have connections to the Outfit, falsely claimed minority status to secure affirmative action contracts worth $100 million. Grzyb, who has since left the city's employment and is now at East Lake Management, denies having any opinions or comments on the matter. Mayor Daley also refuses to comment, citing the ongoing federal case.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, especially in the context of its exploitation by the Duffs. The author implies that affirmative action policies have been manipulated by those with connections and power, such as the Duffs, who allegedly pretended to be minorities to benefit from contracts intended to support genuine minority-owned businesses. The tone suggests a level of cynicism about the implementation of affirmative action in this instance, highlighting the irony of white men with criminal ties being able to claim minority status for financial gain. The author questions the integrity of the system and the fairness of affirmative action when it can be so easily subverted by those with the right connections, rather than serving the communities it was designed to help."	0.021660000000000002	affirmative action	txt/420158599.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is neutral.	"Summary:
The text reflects on the life and legacy of John H. Johnson, a pioneering black publisher who passed away at 87. Johnson was known for his successful business philosophy encapsulated by the advice ""Make yourself indispensable."" His publications, such as Ebony, Jet, and Negro Digest, were crucial in providing a positive representation of black America and opening the advertising market to the black consumer demographic. Johnson's work also offered employment and training for black journalists and presented a more comprehensive coverage of people of color beyond the typical narratives of crime, sports, or entertainment. His autobiography, ""Succeeding Against the Odds,"" showcases the challenges he overcame, including his strategic moves to gain corporate advertising for Ebony, which eventually led him to become one of America's wealthiest businessmen.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, Clarence Page, appears to have a nuanced view of affirmative action. While he doesn't discuss the policy directly, he uses the story of Matthew Henson's employment by Admiral Peary, as highlighted by Johnson in his speech, to illustrate a point about merit and indispensability. Henson was not hired because of any affirmative action plan but because of his unique skills and knowledge, which were critical to Peary's expedition. This anecdote suggests that the author appreciates the value of individual merit and the importance of making oneself indispensable, regardless of race. Johnson's use of Henson's story in his speech, and his own life as an example, indicates a belief in personal excellence and initiative as the path to success, which can be seen as a perspective that values the principles of affirmative action but also underscores the importance of self-reliance and competence."	0.0213	affirmative action	txt/420294538.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text is categorized as neutral on affirmative action.	"The text provides an analysis of the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign's domestic policy debate, emphasizing the stark divide between supporters and detractors of President George W. Bush. It characterizes the election as a competition between ""lovers"" who are fond of Bush's governance, conservative values, and foreign policy, and ""haters"" who strongly oppose him for the same reasons. John Kerry, the challenger, has not garnered as passionate a following, and his policy agenda remains somewhat undefined. However, Kerry is considered to have outperformed Bush in the debates, showcasing a clearer grasp of issues and facts. The debates have highlighted significant policy differences between the candidates, particularly on divisive social issues like abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, and the role of government in health care and education. The article suggests that Bush's challenge is to defend his track record amidst a war and an unstable economy, while Kerry aims to rally voters who are dissatisfied with the current administration. Both candidates have attempted, with limited success, to deliver impactful lines during the debates, and the personal connection with voters is noted as a critical factor in the election, with Bush displaying more warmth than Kerry.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is one of the many contentious domestic issues that were discussed during the presidential debates, reflecting the clear policy distinctions between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. The author does not delve deeply into the specifics of each candidate's stance on affirmative action but includes it as part of the broader set of social issues that are central to the ideological divide in American politics. The emphasis on affirmative action, along with other polarizing topics, underscores the notion that voters in the 2004 election are presented with a definitive choice between two contrasting visions for the country. The author implies that these debates and the candidates' positions on issues like affirmative action are instrumental in shaping voter opinions and the outcome of the election."	0.02669	affirmative action	txt/420306539.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, given their critical view of political correctness and the description of student activities mocking affirmative action policies.	"The text discusses the trend of satirical events at Columbia College Chicago and other universities, designed to mock political correctness, particularly affirmative action policies. Some students have proposed activities like an ""Affirmative Action Bake Sale,"" where prices are set based on race, and a game called ""Catch an Illegal Immigrant,"" where participants chase a student pretending to be an undocumented immigrant. These stunts aim to highlight what the students perceive as the absurdity of race-based policies. The author notes that while such actions are not illegal, they can be hurtful, referencing the incident where Don Imus made derogatory comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. The response of the Rutgers team—to ignore the comments—was praised as a mature reaction, suggesting that sometimes the best response to such provocations is to simply not engage with them.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action and similar policies seem to be viewed with skepticism, if not outright criticism. The use of the term ""wretched excesses"" in relation to political correctness implies disapproval of what the author sees as extreme measures to avoid offending any group. The mention of self-censorship within academia suggests the author believes that the environment has become too restrictive, stifling honest critique and judgment. The proposed student activities are described with a tone that suggests the author finds them to be a mischievous, albeit crude, way to challenge the prevailing attitudes on campus. However, the author also recognizes the potential for such actions to cause pain, as exemplified by the Don Imus incident, and seems to advocate for a more thoughtful approach to addressing and critiquing sensitive issues like affirmative action."	0.01733	affirmative action	txt/420549304.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not clearly indicated; therefore, they should be categorized as neutral on the issue of affirmative action based on the provided summary.	"Summary:
In the text, the author contrasts the short duration of election campaigns in Britain and Canada with the protracted nature of American campaigns, which can now span up to two years. They argue that the lengthy U.S. campaign process serves three purposes: it tests a candidate's organizational skills necessary for managing the federal government; it fosters party consensus and democratic legitimacy through extended dialogue within parties; and it satisfies the American desire for egalitarianism by putting candidates through a physically and spiritually humbling ordeal. The author mentions Barack Obama's and Rudy Giuliani's campaign stances as examples of how campaigns can provoke significant debates and potentially lead to historic shifts in party policies. They also highlight the ordeal of campaigning as a necessary prelude to the power and glory that come with the presidency.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author briefly touches upon the topic of affirmative action, mentioning Barack Obama's suggestion to shift from race-based preferences to class-based preferences. The author views this as a potential point of debate within the Democratic Party that could lead to a historic discussion and a new national consensus. This indicates that the author sees the presidential campaign as a platform for raising and potentially transforming significant policy issues, including affirmative action. However, the text does not provide a detailed exposition of the author's personal stance on affirmative action; instead, it focuses on the role of campaign discussions in shaping party positions and national policies."	0.01982	affirmative action	txt/420557855.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Lewis Hamilton, a 22-year-old Formula One driver, has made an exceptional start to his F1 career, with a third-place finish in Australia and a second-place finish in Malaysia. He is quickly making a name for himself among the greats like Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. Hamilton, who is the first black driver in F1, is on the verge of achieving his first victory, potentially in Bahrain. He has been following the protocol of deferring to his senior teammate, Fernando Alonso, but has expressed a strong desire to win a race. During the Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton executed an impressive defensive strategy against Ferrari drivers, contributing to Alonso's victory and securing third place in the world championship standings, the highest ever for a rookie at this stage.

The author notes that Hamilton's rise in the world of F1 includes only a slight element of affirmative action, just enough to be fair in the costly realm of international racing. Lewis Hamilton's journey began when his father bought him a go-kart at age 8, leading to a developmental contract with McLaren at age 13 due to his evident talent. He excelled in the F3 Euroseries and the GP2 series, which are precursors to F1. Hamilton's opportunity to join the McLaren-Mercedes F1 team came about, in part, due to an ironic twist when Juan Pablo Montoya left F1 for NASCAR, thereby vacating a seat that Hamilton has since filled impressively. The author portrays Hamilton as a skilled and determined driver whose minimal assistance through affirmative action is overshadowed by his evident talent and hard-earned achievements in the racing world."	0.020770000000000004	affirmative action	txt/420558694.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not directly stated in the summary provided. the text focuses on political criticism rather than a clear stance on affirmative action. therefore, based on the information given, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be accurately categorized.	"The text criticizes President Barack Obama's handling of a situation involving AIG executives receiving large bonuses after a financial crisis, which were funded by the government bailout. The author points out the irony and perceived hypocrisy in the reactions of the Obama administration and congressional Democrats, who expressed outrage despite allegedly being aware of the bonuses well in advance. The text draws parallels between political practices in Washington and those in Chicago's City Hall, suggesting a culture of backroom deals and political theater aimed at covering up responsibility. The author uses terms like ""Hopium"" and ""tingles running up their legs"" to describe what they perceive as the media's and public's initial infatuation with Obama and their eventual disillusionment.

From the perspective on affirmative action mentioned in the text, the author seems skeptical and critical. They highlight an incident where Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley was involved in a scandal over affirmative action contracts that were given to white men instead of minority women, despite the program's intent. This anecdote is used to illustrate the author's view that political figures may exploit affirmative action for their own benefit or connections, rather than to genuinely support minorities. The tone suggests that the author views affirmative action as a policy that can be manipulated by those in power, casting doubt on its effectiveness and implementation."	0.020950000000000003	affirmative action	txt/420733639.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its necessity in addressing diversity issues while also acknowledging the associated challenges and complexities.	"Phyllis Lockett, an African-American woman with impressive credentials including an MBA from Kellogg School of Management and CEO experience, was recruited by executive recruiter Charles Tribbett III to join the board of a major cultural institution in Chicago. The recruitment was part of a broader initiative called IMPACT, funded by several foundations including the Joyce Foundation, which aimed to increase diversity on the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits. Despite her qualifications, Lockett was aware that her race and gender were factors in her selection, and she embraced this, citing the lack of diversity on such boards. Over three years, the program spent about $400,000 to place nine qualified minorities on boards, responding to the challenge of finding diverse candidates outside of the usual social networks. The initiative faced challenges, such as convincing institutions to participate, meeting annual giving requirements, and addressing concerns about tokenism.

The author suggests that the affirmative action approach taken by IMPACT is necessary due to the significant lack of diversity on nonprofit boards in Chicago. The perspective acknowledges the complexities and challenges of affirmative action, such as the potential for tokenism and the enforcement of giving standards that may be different for minority members. However, the author also points out the positive impact of the program, including the successful placement of qualified candidates who might otherwise have been overlooked due to systemic biases. The mention of Melissa Harris's view at the end, wishing diversity didn't require a special program, reflects a nuanced understanding that while such initiatives are currently needed to address imbalances, the ultimate goal is to reach a point where diversity is naturally integrated into the selection process without the need for targeted programs."	0.02131	affirmative action	txt/420906077.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author's perspective on affirmative action is neutral. they do not explicitly support or oppose affirmative action but criticize the oversimplification and misappropriation of martin luther king jr.'s views in the context of the affirmative action debate.	"The text reflects on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., acknowledging the complexity and multifaceted nature of his work beyond the famous ""I have a dream"" speech. It highlights King's lesser-known book, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?,"" as evidence of his practical approach to social issues. The author cautions against retroactively fitting King's words to contemporary issues, as was done during the debate over Proposition 209 in California, and warns against the oversimplification of King's ideas. The text outlines several areas King addressed, including the black family crisis, educational neglect, political apathy, corporate racism, economic empowerment, crime and violence, and welfare. Despite the mixed success of his proposals, the author argues that King's vision remains superior to the superficial efforts of many of today's politicians and community leaders.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it should not be simplistically linked to King's legacy. The author criticizes the misuse of King's words in debates over affirmative action, such as those surrounding California's Proposition 209, where both sides distorted King's views to support their arguments. The author implies that King's genuine positions on social justice are more nuanced and cannot be easily categorized or appropriated for modern political agendas. The text suggests that King's broader agenda for racial and class justice, which includes but is not limited to affirmative action, is more relevant and substantial than the selective use of his rhetoric in contemporary policy debates."	0.022170000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421118533.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat against.	"The text describes California as a land of constant change with recurring themes and challenges, such as the struggle over water resources, particularly from the Colorado River. Political campaigns in California historically focus on creating division by targeting various groups, from Chinese laborers in the mid-1800s to the more recent targets like Mexican field workers and affirmative action beneficiaries. The author also touches on the potential scapegoating of people with Asian connections in upcoming elections.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, suggesting it is used as a wedge issue in California politics. By listing affirmative action among the various groups that have been targeted over time, the author implies that it is a divisive topic leveraged by politicians to gain votes rather than a policy aimed at achieving social justice or equality. The tone suggests a level of cynicism towards the political exploitation of such issues and how they are perennially recycled in the public discourse without meaningful progress or resolution."	0.016890000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421152514.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text seems neutral on affirmative action, focusing more on the broader context of american optimism and how it affects public perception of various issues, including affirmative action.	"The text discusses the resurgence of American optimism, a sentiment that had been largely absent since the early 1970s. Americans are now more confident about their personal lives and the country's future, with consumer confidence at a 28-year high and various polls indicating a positive shift in public mood. This renewed optimism is attributed to the strong economy, low unemployment, shrinking federal budget deficit, declining crime rates, and stabilization of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth rates. Additionally, Americans now view their country as a leader in shaping the future, with cities like Seattle, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley at the forefront of technological and cultural innovation.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it was previously a target of conservative criticism, used to explain the anxiety felt by many Americans. Conservatives blamed affirmative action, along with other factors like big government and cultural change, for the nation's problems. However, in the current climate of optimism, such issues are losing their potency as points of public agitation. The author suggests that the politics of fear and division are less effective in times of prosperity, and voters are more inclined to seek incremental change and compromise rather than ideological crusades or polarization. The text implies that while affirmative action was once a contentious issue, the improved public mood may lead to a more nuanced and less confrontational approach to such policies."	0.02245	affirmative action	txt/421214771.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text provided outlines a proposal by the Clinton administration to enhance civil rights enforcement by increasing funding for relevant federal agencies. This proposal aims to address persistent racial barriers in employment, housing, and other areas by ensuring that laws are strictly enforced, thereby guaranteeing everyone an equal opportunity regardless of their background. The plan includes a 17% increase in civil rights funding, additional resources for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to manage its case backlog, and more funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to hire testers to uncover housing discrimination. The author emphasizes the importance of not just dialogue about race but also concrete actions to ensure fair treatment for all.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be supportive, as they highlight the ongoing prevalence of racial inequality and discrimination in various sectors of society. They reference Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent, which underscores the reality of different treatment based on race despite identical qualifications. The author questions the logic of political opponents who claim to support equal opportunity but oppose measures to strengthen the enforcement of equality laws. By advocating for increased funding and stricter enforcement of civil rights laws, the author suggests that affirmative action and similar initiatives are necessary to level the playing field and provide everyone with the fair chance they deserve. The author views the Clinton administration's proposal as a critical step towards achieving this goal."	0.014310000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421215181.xml.txt
2	neutral	neutral	"The text discusses the importance of having political candidates with a ""fire in the belly,"" a term used to describe a strong desire to win and achieve goals. The author reflects on the candidates for the California gubernatorial race, noting that three potential candidates with promising credentials did not enter the race, leaving four others who did demonstrate the necessary drive. The author suggests that while none of the candidates may be the ideal choice for governor, they are eager and determined, which is crucial for political leadership.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action appears to be a contentious issue in the context of the California gubernatorial race. The author mentions that one of the potential Republican candidates, Mayor Richard Riordan, did not support anti-affirmative action initiatives, which made him a less appealing choice for Republican voters and a ""fat target"" for his opponent, Dan Lungren. The author's inclusion of this detail suggests that affirmative action is a divisive topic that can significantly impact a candidate's political standing and electability within their party. However, the author does not explicitly express a personal stance on affirmative action, focusing more on the candidates' political strategies and public perceptions."	0.018540000000000004	affirmative action	txt/421228265.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not explicitly express a stance on affirmative action, but rather discusses the broader context of political discourse and the importance of interpersonal relationships among legislators when addressing sensitive issues. the text does not provide enough information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action would be classified as not concerned with affirmative action in the context of the summary provided.	"The text is a reflective piece by Herschel Rosenthal, a retiring state legislator who has served for 24 years. He observes changes in the California state Capitol, noting both positive and negative developments. On the positive side, public involvement in state policy has increased due to the Internet and live broadcasts of legislative sessions. Additionally, the Legislature now better reflects California's diversity, with more women and Hispanic members than when Rosenthal first took office. However, he laments the decline in personal relationships among legislators, which he believes has made the job less enjoyable and complicated the process of reaching agreement on public policy. Rosenthal reminisces about the days when legislators from different parties and ideologies would socialize and engage in friendly activities, fostering respect and understanding. He attributes the current lack of camaraderie to factors such as crass public discourse, term limits, and political competitiveness, which have eroded the personal connections essential for effective governance.

From the author's perspective, the deterioration of interpersonal relationships among legislators has had significant consequences, particularly in the handling of sensitive issues like affirmative action, bilingual education, and illegal immigration. Rosenthal expresses concern over the ""disturbing racial undertones"" of recent ballot measures and the lack of sensitivity or understanding displayed during debates on these topics. He suggests that the political arena, which naturally attracts strong personalities and opinions, requires legislators to make an effort to know each other personally and discuss nonlegislative matters. Rosenthal advocates for off-hour social interactions as a means to build harmony and understanding in a diverse society like California. He implies that such efforts could lead to better collaboration and more thoughtful policy-making, especially when dealing with complex and contentious issues."	0.02024	affirmative action	txt/421303437.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action. they recognize its benefits for some individuals but criticize its failure to address broader class issues and its insufficient impact on systemic racism.	"The text discusses President Bill Clinton's initiative for a national conversation on race, highlighting its limitations if it does not also address class issues. The author suggests that while affirmative action has helped some people of color enter the middle class, it has done little for those in the working and poverty classes. The text traces the evolution of the civil rights movement, noting the shift from a focus on political and legal rights to an emphasis on black capitalism, which was supported by corporate interests and government leaders like President Nixon. The author argues that this shift has not effectively tackled racism and that a more comprehensive approach that includes class analysis is necessary.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, viewing it as insufficient for addressing the broader economic challenges faced by poor people of color. They acknowledge the benefits of affirmative action in creating a new generation of professionals among minorities, but argue that it has not significantly improved the economic conditions of the working and poverty classes. The author contends that civil rights organizations were co-opted into prioritizing middle- and upper-class interests over those of the poor, and that a class-based strategy is essential to effectively combat racism. They also suggest that conservative critics of affirmative action who advocate for class-based policies may not be genuinely interested in helping the poor but rather in undermining race-based policies. The author calls for a nuanced approach to fighting racism that recognizes the varied experiences of racism across different economic classes and advocates for legal and structural changes to address these disparities."	0.025050000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421333085.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text seems to be neutral on the issue of affirmative action, focusing instead on reporting the political landscape and changes within the california legislature, particularly regarding latino representation. the text does not explicitly advocate for or against affirmative action but rather discusses its role in the political strategies of the republican party in california.	"The text provided discusses the rise of Latino political figures in California, highlighting the election of Cruz Bustamante as the first Latino Assembly speaker and then lieutenant governor, the succession of Antonio Villaraigosa as speaker, and the emergence of Rod Pacheco, a Republican Latino, as a new leader in the legislative assembly. Pacheco's selection as the minority leader of the Assembly Republicans marks him as the first Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. The article notes that one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino, indicating a significant increase in Latino political representation. It also mentions that the Republican Party is looking to move past the negative associations with former Governor Pete Wilson's campaigns against affirmative action and illegal immigration and is hopeful about the potential of Republican Latinos like Pacheco to appeal to voters statewide.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action appears to be a contentious issue within the context of California politics, particularly for the Republican Party. The author suggests that the party is attempting to distance itself from past campaigns that were perceived as hostile towards Latinos, such as those led by Governor Pete Wilson. The GOP is described as being in need of credible messengers to change Latino voters' perceptions, and Pacheco, with his moderate stances and opposition to Proposition 187 (anti-illegal immigration initiative), but support for Proposition 209 (ending state racial preferences), is seen as a potentially appealing figure. The author indicates that Pacheco is uncomfortable with being used as a recruiter for the Republican Party among Latinos, preferring to focus on his work rather than carry the party's banner. The author also notes that Pacheco's and other Latino politicians' rise to prominence reflects a new era in California politics that is becoming more moderate and more diverse, with an increasing number of Latino representatives."	0.0233	affirmative action	txt/421424365.xml.txt
	None	"the author of the text does not express a clear stance on affirmative action; instead, the text focuses on the shifting priorities of voters and the political strategies of politicians in california. the passage mentioning affirmative action is used to illustrate how public concern over issues can diminish following legislative action. the author's perspective on affirmative action is not the focus of the text, so they would be categorized as ""not concerned"" with affirmative action in this context."	"Governor Gray Davis and his predecessor Pete Wilson have focused on education reform as a key political issue in California. Education has been a winning issue for politicians, and neglecting it, as Dan Lungren did, has proven to be a mistake with voters. However, pollster Steve Kinney believes that education as a top voter concern may soon decline. He suggests that health care is rising in importance and that infrastructure will be the leading issue by the 2002 election, unless economic conditions change and shift voter concerns back to taxes, crime, and jobs. Kinney predicts that voters will become complacent about education once they perceive that the government is addressing the issue, particularly after legislative action and increased federal funding. He points to the cooling of other hot issues like illegal immigration and affirmative action after the passage of Propositions 187 and 209 as evidence for his theory.

From the author's perspective, Kinney's analysis is based on the intensity of voters' concerns, focusing only on those who rate issues as a ""10"" on a personal importance scale. While education remains the top concern for now, Kinney and another pollster, Paul Maslin, agree that health care and infrastructure will become more significant over time, especially as the population grows and the baby boomer generation ages. The author suggests that Governor Davis should be proactive on these emerging issues, as legislative leaders like Antonio Villaraigosa and John Burton are already addressing health care and transportation, respectively. The author implies that Davis needs to demonstrate he can manage multiple issues simultaneously or risk being overtaken by both the legislature and public opinion."	0.022600000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action but rather describes jim brulte's tactical avoidance of the issue while still supporting diversity within the party through campaign investments. the perspective on affirmative action is therefore not clearly stated, but the context suggests a neutral to somewhat in favor stance, as the actions described are affirmative action-like in nature but not explicitly endorsed as a policy position.	"The text criticizes the California Republican Party for its lack of strong leadership and viable candidates for high-profile positions such as governor, U.S. senator, or state attorney general. The GOP is said to have no significant presence in these roles, with Democrats holding the governor's office, both U.S. Senate seats, and the majority of statewide partisan offices. The text highlights two Republican officials who have faced setbacks: Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, who was involved in a scandal, and Secretary of State Bill Jones, who alienated GOP donors by switching his support to John McCain from George W. Bush. However, the author points out Jim Brulte, the new state Senate minority leader, as a competent and respected figure within the party. Brulte, known for his political acumen and ability to work without compromising conservative principles, is tasked with improving or maintaining the GOP's position in the Senate. He focuses on unifying issues and avoids divisive topics such as abortion, illegal immigration, and affirmative action. Instead, Brulte has his own affirmative action program, investing in the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. Despite the party's challenges, Brulte remains optimistic about its future in California, having improved its financial standing and actively supporting George W. Bush's fundraising efforts in the state.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be reflected through the lens of Jim Brulte's actions and approach. While Brulte avoids getting involved in divisive issues like affirmative action in the public policy arena, he has his own version of affirmative action by financially supporting the campaigns of Republican women and minorities. This suggests that the author sees Brulte's approach as a practical strategy to broaden the party's appeal and address diversity within its ranks without engaging in the contentious public debates that typically surround affirmative action policies. Brulte's method indicates a belief in the value of inclusivity and representation within the party, aligning with a more pragmatic and less ideologically driven form of affirmative action that focuses on political strategy and party growth."	0.025140000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421508307.xml.txt

"Governor Gray Davis of California has recently signed a bill that mandates overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, positioning California alongside Alaska as the only states with such a requirement. This move contradicts Davis's previously cultivated image as a centrist leader, revealing a leftward shift influenced by the liberal state legislature and the interest groups that supported his campaign. The new law, which will affect millions of employees and businesses, is criticized for reducing workplace flexibility and potentially harming California's business environment. Despite attempts to claim that the legislation includes provisions for employer concerns, these are seen as minimal and have not convinced Republican legislators or business organizations.

From the author's perspective, Davis appears to be straying from his centrist promises by implementing policies that cater to his left-leaning allies, such as unions, environmentalists, and trial lawyers. The author highlights that Davis has made appointments from these groups and has revived a form of affirmative action at the University of California. Despite his claims of centrism and his cautious approach to government overreach, Davis's actions suggest a tendency to favor regulatory expansion and his political base over a true middle-ground governance. The author, James W. Robinson, is an advisor to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and clarifies that the views expressed are his own, implying a business-oriented critique of Davis's policies."	0.01951	affirmative action	txt/421525331.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action, but with reservations about its current implementation and a preference for a more nuanced approach that targets individuals facing actual disadvantages.	"The text is a reflection by a parent on their son Miguel's high school essay about affirmative action. Miguel, who identifies as a Latino student in a predominantly Caucasian school, initially argues against affirmative action despite being someone who would benefit from it. He views the program as unfair, outdated, and a form of reverse racism. His parent, a former advocate for affirmative action, initially disagrees with Miguel's stance, considering the program's historical importance in providing opportunities for minorities and in addressing social disadvantages. However, Miguel's background is one of privilege, with educated parents, a top-ranking school, and ample home resources, leading his parent to acknowledge that Miguel might not personally need affirmative action to succeed. The essay touches on the idea that while disparities still exist, affirmative action can be more selectively targeted towards students who truly need help, rather than being based solely on race.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a nuanced issue. Although they initially react with frustration to their son's critical stance on affirmative action, they take a moment to consider the argument. The author recognizes the program's significance in the past for integrating institutions and compensating for social disadvantages. However, they also understand that affirmative action should adapt to the current context, targeting assistance to those who face real adversity, rather than applying blanket policies based on race. The author seems to favor a more selective and reality-based approach to affirmative action, one that acknowledges the varied circumstances of students and provides opportunities to those who face significant challenges, regardless of race. This is evidenced by their approval of the new plan that broadens University of California eligibility and the acknowledgment that the university already considers social factors in admissions. The author's son also eventually adjusts his view, suggesting a more inclusive approach to opportunity and success."	0.022090000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author of the text is strongly against the current implementation of affirmative action that relies on standardized testing.	"The text criticizes the use of the SAT as a measure of merit in college admissions, arguing that it perpetuates racial, economic, and cultural inequalities. It points out that the SAT does not accurately reflect students' potential for success and is biased against those who do not come from privileged backgrounds. The author also rejects the idea that alternative standardized tests, like the SAT II or other professional exams, are better measures of merit, as they suffer from similar biases. The text highlights that standardized tests are poor predictors of college success and that educational resources are not equitably distributed, which disadvantages minority students. The author advocates for admissions criteria that recognize student motivation, critical thinking, and intercultural awareness, rather than test scores. The piece also mentions that significant funds are wasted on test preparation, which could be better spent on expanding educational opportunities.

The author expresses a strong opposition to affirmative action as it is currently implemented, which relies on standardized testing. They view the reliance on tests like the SAT as inherently racist and economically biased, effectively serving as a proxy for maintaining the status quo of racial and economic privilege. The author suggests that the University of California's move to question the SAT is a step in the right direction but criticizes the suggestion to replace it with another standardized test like the SAT II. They call for a more equitable approach to admissions that values student effort and potential over performance on standardized tests. The perspective is that education should be more inclusive and that resources should be redirected to create more educational opportunities for all students, rather than excluding them based on biased criteria."	0.020180000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	based on the provided information, the author, sharon woodson-bryant, seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, acknowledging its importance and the positive role it has played in promoting civil rights and opportunities for minorities and women.	"The text is a personal reflection by Sharon Woodson-Bryant on the complexities of being a black Republican, based on her own experiences and observations, including her father's involvement as a delegate to the 1964 GOP convention. She recounts an incident from her youth where they faced hostility, and she expresses pride in her father's actions despite the Republican Party's stance on civil rights at the time. Woodson-Bryant notes that contemporary black Republicans may join the party for various reasons, some seeking less competition or enjoying the provocation of others, while others, like her father, were genuinely committed to the black community and civil rights, as evidenced by figures like Art Fletcher who helped lay the groundwork for affirmative action. She shares her own journey of leaving the Republican Party and becoming a Democrat as her political values evolved, distancing herself from the modern iteration of black Republicans who she feels lack the same loyalty and commitment her father had.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is one of respect and recognition for its historical significance, especially as it pertains to the work of black Republicans like Art Fletcher, who played a role in its development. She views affirmative action as a legacy of past civil rights activism within the Republican Party, which aimed to increase opportunities for minorities and women. The Philadelphia Plan, which Fletcher helped implement, is cited as a forerunner of affirmative action efforts that made a tangible difference in the job market. Woodson-Bryant's reflection suggests a nuanced understanding of affirmative action, acknowledging its roots in the Republican Party's past efforts towards equality, while also implicitly contrasting those efforts with the present state of the party and its members' motivations."	0.02001	affirmative action	txt/421600586.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text, felicia clark, is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Summary:
Felicia Clark criticizes the U.S. government's handling of the 2000 census, which introduced 57 multiethnic categories. She argues that this move complicates the monitoring and legislation of affirmative action and other race-based programs, as it dilutes the political power of ethnic communities and serves conservative interests rather than promoting cultural pluralism. Clark points out the inconsistency in categorization, where multiethnic individuals of lighter skin are grouped into one ""white"" category, while those of darker skin are fragmented into many categories. She questions the purpose and clarity of these new categories, suggesting that they may undermine ethnic community voting blocs and that socio-economic factors might be more relevant for modern political and economic analysis. Clark advocates for a return to traditional race categories until the government provides a clear rationale for the change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and protective. Clark sees affirmative action as a necessary tool to address historical injustices and to ensure fair representation and opportunities for historically oppressed groups. She is concerned that the introduction of 57 multiethnic categories in the census will hinder the effectiveness of affirmative action. Clark believes that the new categorization system is a political maneuver that benefits conservative agendas by weakening the political influence of minority groups and making it harder to implement race-based programs. She implies that affirmative action policies require clear and meaningful racial data to function correctly, and the new census categories only serve to obscure and complicate this data. Clark's stance is that until there is a transparent and justified need for these new categories, it is better to maintain established traditional race categories to support affirmative action and the interests of minority communities."	0.017150000000000002	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt
0	strongly_against	the author, edwin a. locke, is strongly against affirmative action.	"The University of California's Board of Regents has introduced new admissions policies that de-emphasize academic qualifications and consider other factors such as athletic or artistic talent, and overcoming adversity. The policies aim to avoid race-based admissions, but the author argues that the real intent is to remove fairness and objectivity from the process. The SAT and high school grades, traditionally used for admissions, are deemed the best predictors of academic success and are objective measures. The author suggests that the new policies will allow for hidden agendas and politicization of the admissions process, potentially favoring students with certain political views.

The author, Edwin A. Locke, is critical of affirmative action and believes that the University of California's new admissions policies are a covert attempt to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions, despite legal prohibitions. He argues that the new ""holistic"" approach will make it difficult for students to understand how to prepare for college and is unfair to academically deserving students. Locke sees the motive behind the policies as an unwillingness to acknowledge that some students are more academically qualified than others, and he views the move as an attack on the concept of academic competence. He warns that this could harm both students and the integrity of the university system. Locke's perspective is rooted in a belief in meritocracy and the importance of maintaining objective standards in higher education admissions."	0.017050000000000003	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems to be somewhat against affirmative action, as indicated by the critical view of rehnquist's approach and the implication that the court's decisions could be swayed by personal ideologies rather than consistent principles.	"The text provides an overview of the impact and legacy of various chief justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, focusing on the tenure of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. It details how different chief justices, like John Marshall and Earl Warren, have shaped American constitutional principles. Rehnquist is noted for his conservative views, such as states' rights and a narrow interpretation of congressional authority. Despite his long service and conservative efforts, the court under Rehnquist upheld certain liberal decisions, like Roe vs. Wade. His most controversial ruling was in Bush vs. Gore, which the author implies was inconsistent with the court's earlier reluctance to entertain equal-protection claims. The text also mentions Rehnquist's health issues and the potential implications of his eventual replacement on the court's ideological balance.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, seems to be critical of Rehnquist's approach. The author suggests that Rehnquist's opinions often lack clear guiding principles, leaving uncertainty about how the court would rule on affirmative action programs. This lack of clarity is criticized as not serving the court or the public well, implying that the author values more principled and transparent judicial reasoning. Additionally, the author's mention of Rehnquist's ""ignominious"" role in Bush vs. Gore and the potential impact of his successor on the court's direction suggests a concern that the court's decisions on matters like affirmative action could be profoundly affected by the personal ideologies of the justices rather than a consistent application of constitutional principles."	0.02258	affirmative action	txt/421978637.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text, david gelernter, would be categorized as somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
David Gelernter, a Yale professor and senior fellow at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, criticizes the Democratic Party for what he sees as their reactionary liberalism and resistance to progress. He accuses the Democrats, particularly Senator Charles Schumer, of misrepresenting the Republican Party as wanting to regress to earlier, less progressive eras. Gelernter contends that the Republicans are the true progressives, seeking to move forward on issues such as judicial appointments, education reform, and social security, while Democrats are portrayed as obstructive and clinging to the status quo. He argues that the roles of Democrats and Republicans have switched, with Republicans now championing change and justice. Gelernter also takes issue with the Democrats' approach to democracy, affirmative action, and foreign policy, suggesting that their perspectives are outdated and resistant to necessary change.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author, David Gelernter, expresses a critical view of affirmative action, implying that it may have outlived its usefulness. He questions whether racism, sexism, and classism are still the sole explanations for societal issues and whether three decades of affirmative action policies are sufficient. Gelernter points to tenured professors who have never experienced a world without affirmative action and suggests that the Democrats' refusal to reevaluate these policies is indicative of their broader reluctance to adapt to change. His tone suggests a belief that affirmative action might now be an impediment to progress, and he seems to advocate for a reassessment of its role in contemporary society."	0.019320000000000004	affirmative action	txt/421987509.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text discusses the criticism Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has faced since his confirmation hearings, with particular focus on accusations that he was an ""affirmative action hire."" Critics, including liberal columnists like Eugene Robinson and Anna Quindlen, have suggested that Thomas' appointment was based on his race rather than merit. This criticism is seen as hypocritical by the author, as those who support affirmative action are simultaneously attacking Thomas, a supposed beneficiary of such policies, for being unqualified. The author also alludes to the personal impact of affirmative action on individuals like Thomas, who feels that his achievements are devalued due to racial preferences.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy in liberal arguments. They argue that while liberals defend racial preferences, they undermine their own stance by disparaging Thomas as an undeserving beneficiary of such policies. The author suggests that affirmative action can lead to doubts about the competence of black professionals and can cause personal insecurity among those it aims to help. The author empathizes with this sentiment, drawing a parallel with how they would feel if sexual orientation were used as a factor in professional advancement. The author contends that individuals should not be demeaned or reduced to their immutable traits and that the system of affirmative action is flawed if it leads to such outcomes. They also criticize the personal attacks on Thomas and call for him to be treated as an individual rather than a representation of political disagreements."	0.020460000000000002	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt
	None	the author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. the focus is more on the confirmation process, judicial philosophy, and political strategy rather than on affirmative action itself. therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given summary.	"During the final day of Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination hearings, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee emphasized the importance of issues such as national security, the growing deficit, gun rights, and cautioned against judicial activism. Legal analysts generally agreed that Sotomayor maintained a moderate stance throughout the hearings and presented herself as open-minded regarding future legal decisions.

Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, expressed skepticism about the confirmation process, suggesting it was more performative than informative, with Sotomayor following a script that obscured the true nature of a Supreme Court justice's role. He noted that she appeared to lean conservatively on certain issues, such as rejecting the use of foreign law and describing the Constitution as static, to appease conservative concerns. This approach, Chemerinsky believes, was strategic to ensure a smooth confirmation. The author's perspective on affirmative action is revealed through the discussion of identity politics; he criticizes Republican senators for using the hearings to appeal to white Americans' fears about nonwhites in positions of power. He suggests that the focus on affirmative action during the hearings was more about promoting Republican ideology than thoroughly evaluating Sotomayor's qualifications, although he ultimately views her performance as successful in portraying herself as a moderate and restrained judge."	0.017480000000000002	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, as they believe it inadequately addresses the underlying economic issues and may even contribute to racial tensions and class divides.	"The text discusses the Miami riot and the broader issue of racial violence, arguing against the notion that such riots are solely a result of racial discrimination. The author points out that while discrimination, particularly by the Miami police, was a factor, the deeper cause is rooted in class conflict and economic disparities within the black community. The riot in Miami, similar to those in the 1960s, was a manifestation of frustration among the black lower class who have not seen the benefits of civil rights advancements. The author notes that despite a growing black middle class, the economic situation for many in the black lower class has not improved, with a lack of decent job opportunities and increased unemployment. The author suggests that the solutions to these issues are not being adequately addressed by current policies.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action, while aimed at reducing discrimination, may inadvertently exacerbate racial tensions and the class divide within the black community. The author argues that affirmative action helps only a small segment of the community—those who can attend college and compete for high-level jobs—leaving the most disadvantaged unaffected. Instead, the author advocates for direct programs that ensure full employment, increase job opportunities for teenagers, and reform the welfare system. The author criticizes the reduction of such programs in the federal budget, warning that without them, the situation for poor blacks will not improve, and urban areas will remain vulnerable to racial unrest. David Whitman, the author, is identified as a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University."	0.02066	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"The text criticizes the Reagan Administration for its choices in appointing Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation and William Bell to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The author suggests these choices are ill-suited to the roles, with Zumbrun having a history of opposing the very law he would administer and Bell lacking any significant accomplishments in management or civil rights. The author implies that these appointments are akin to letting ""foxes guard chickens,"" with Zumbrun's preference for aiding corporations against government regulation and Bell's ineffectiveness in his recruiting firm. The criticism extends to the administration's persistence in undermining the Legal Services Corporation despite congressional support for the program.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action and the support for legal aid for the needy are essential components of a just society. The author disapproves of Zumbrun's opposition to affirmative action and his track record of supporting corporate interests over environmental and regulatory issues, indicating a belief that Zumbrun's leadership would be detrimental to the goals of the Legal Services Corporation. The author's tone suggests a broader concern that the Reagan Administration's appointments are not in the best interest of the public, particularly the poor, workers, and those in need of legal aid, but rather serve political or ideological agendas. The mention of Zumbrun's hostility towards affirmative action suggests the author values this policy and views opposition to it as a negative trait in a candidate for public service."	0.01447	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt
	None	the author does not express a clear stance on affirmative action. their focus is on the financial aspects of the westway project and the perceived mismanagement of funds. the mention of affirmative action consultants and their fees is within this financial context rather than a critique of affirmative action as a policy. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the text provided. they should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action based on the information given.	"The text provided by the user is a detailed account of the expenditures on the Westway project, a 4.2-mile superhighway-waterfront development intended to replace the deteriorated West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. The project, initially estimated to cost $1.4 billion, has now soared to projections of over $4 billion. The author reports that $75 million has been spent so far, primarily funded by the Federal Highway Trust Fund and the state. The author lists various contractors, consultants, and firms that have received significant payments for their services, with amounts ranging from half a million to over twenty-four million dollars. The author criticizes the project as an extravagant and unnecessary expense during a time of budget constraints and suggests that the funds could be better allocated to mass transit rehabilitation.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as gleaned from the text, appears critical, especially in the context of the Westway project. While affirmative action is not the central focus of the text, the author does mention affirmative action consultants (R.T.P. Inc./Boone, Young & Associates Inc.) who have been paid nearly a million dollars. The author's overall tone suggests skepticism about the project's costs and management, and by extension, may imply a questioning of the value or efficiency of the affirmative action consulting within this context. The author's call for accountability, especially in light of the judge's admonishment of certain representatives for ""false responses"" and ""an intent to misrepresent,"" could suggest a broader concern about the integrity and transparency of those who benefit from public funds, including those involved in affirmative action efforts related to the project. However, without more explicit commentary on affirmative action, it's difficult to fully ascertain the author's stance on the policy in general."	0.0242	affirmative action	txt/424505995.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"In the text provided, the author describes a scene where Lyndon Johnson, feeling overshadowed by John F. Kennedy's civil rights legacy, gathers press secretaries to assert his own accomplishments in the same arena. The narrative then shifts to Morris Abram's nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which brings the contentious issue of affirmative action to the forefront. Abram, who has fought against bigotry throughout his life, holds a cautious stance on affirmative action, arguing that it should only be applied in a neutral manner, without favoring any particular group, which he equates to ""governmentally enforced quotas."" He is deeply troubled by the idea of quotas, fearing they will lead to conflict and tragedy as multiple minority groups seek preferential treatment.

The author presents a critical view of Abram's position on affirmative action, suggesting that Abram's approach is too technical and lacks generosity. The author argues that affirmative action is a necessary tool to address the historical injustices of racism and that government frequently enacts various forms of preferential treatment for different groups. Justice Blackmun's perspective in the Bakke case is cited, emphasizing that acknowledging race is essential to overcoming racism and achieving equality. The author also challenges Abram's reluctance to support measures that would actively open up opportunities for minorities, such as job training paired with efforts to ensure job availability. The author concludes by invoking Johnson's words, suggesting that true fairness requires more than freedom and equal opportunity; it demands active measures to compensate for historical disadvantages. The message is clear: neutrality and a hands-off approach are insufficient in the quest for true equality."	0.020380000000000002	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not express a perspective on affirmative action as it is commonly understood in the context of policies or measures designed to improve opportunities for historically marginalized groups. the text does not address this topic; instead, it focuses on cold war politics and diplomacy. therefore, the author should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action.	"The text discusses the political climate of 1984, emphasizing the internal power dynamics in both the United States and the Soviet Union. It suggests that the death of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov has made it unlikely for major issues between the superpowers to be resolved within the year. The author proposes that, despite the challenges, there are still modest opportunities to improve relations, particularly through gestures of respect and understanding. The text highlights the potential impact of the Soviet Union easing its repression of dissidents, mentioning the cases of Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Shcharansky. It also critiques President Reagan's rhetoric, which is perceived as hostile in the Soviet Union, and notes the importance of the U.S. showing a willingness to engage in diplomacy without appearing threatening.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be that it can serve as a diplomatic tool to signal a desire for improved relations. In the context of the Cold War, the author suggests that the Soviet Union could make a positive impact on Western opinion by releasing prominent dissidents, which would be seen as a human gesture of goodwill. This action would not only help the individuals involved but also serve as a signal to the United States that the Soviet Union is open to negotiation and respectful of human rights concerns. The author also calls for a balanced understanding from the U.S. side, criticizing President Reagan's aggressive language and advocating for a more diplomatic approach that does not provoke fear of destruction in the Soviet Union. The author seems to believe that affirmative gestures, alongside careful communication, could pave the way for more substantial negotiations in the future, particularly on arms control."	0.022240000000000003	affirmative action	txt/424890519.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they recognize the necessity of sessions' efforts to address discrimination within the fbi and advocate for the importance of the bureau setting an example in civil rights.	"William Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has acknowledged the agency's failure to ensure equal treatment for minority employees and is taking steps to address affirmative action within the bureau. After facing multiple instances of discrimination, including a federal judge's ruling against the FBI for discriminating against Hispanic agents and the harassment of a black agent, Donald Rochon, Sessions has made changes. He replaced the person in charge of equal employment efforts with an outsider and announced that black and Hispanic agents would participate on promotion boards. The FBI has faced consequences for these issues, such as being turned away from recruiting at some campuses.

From the author's perspective, Sessions' actions towards improving affirmative action within the FBI are seen as a necessary and urgent response to the discrimination that has been documented within the agency. The author emphasizes the importance of the FBI, as an enforcer of civil rights laws, to adhere strictly to those same laws within its own ranks. The tone suggests that while the actions taken by Sessions are a step in the right direction, they are just the beginning of what needs to be a sustained effort to eradicate discrimination and promote equality within the FBI. The author appears to advocate for prompt and effective solutions, indicating a belief in the critical importance of the FBI setting an example in the realm of civil rights."	0.01267	affirmative action	txt/427134596.xml.txt
	None	the author does not express a clear stance on affirmative action itself; the topic is mentioned only in passing in relation to a political strategy. therefore, the author is not concerned with affirmative action in the context provided.	"The text is a satirical commentary on the perceived slow and complacent approach of the Bush Administration to governance, as told through a joke about President Bush being knocked out cold and waking up years later to a supposedly well-running country. The author visited Governor Sununu, the White House chief of staff, to discuss this perception and the use of a new phrase, ""enhanced rescission."" Sununu suggests that the Bush Administration operates on a different ""template"" that prioritizes conciliation over confrontation. The article also touches on internal disagreements within the administration, such as the counsel's public objection to a policy decision. The concept of ""enhanced rescission"" is introduced as a compromise between the executive and legislative branches, potentially giving back some power to the President.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is mentioned in the context of a political maneuver called ""enhanced rescission,"" which aims to change the process by which Congress rescinds parts of appropriations. The author seems skeptical about the effectiveness of the Bush Administration's strategy to regain executive power and implies a lack of confidence in the administration's ability to achieve its goals without appearing weak or passive. The mention of affirmative action in this context is brief and technical, focusing on the legislative mechanics rather than the broader social implications of affirmative action policies. The author's tone suggests a critical view of the administration's tactics and their potential impact on the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches."	0.02088	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	author's perspective on affirmative action: strongly in favor	"Summary:
Julian Bond, a former N.A.A.C.P. board member and university professor, writes a satirical memo to journalists and pundits, providing them with a cynical guide on how to portray the N.A.A.C.P. and civil rights leadership negatively in the media. The memo sarcastically suggests story angles that reinforce stereotypes of the organization as outdated and disconnected from the black community. Bond ironically advises focusing on divisive issues, ignoring the N.A.A.C.P.'s achievements, and seeking out conservative voices critical of the organization. He even mocks the media's past efforts to undermine affirmative action and civil rights legislation by suggesting they recycle old arguments against these policies.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
Julian Bond's perspective on affirmative action, as inferred from the text, appears to be supportive of the policy. His ironic suggestion to find black individuals who will argue against affirmative action, coupled with a warning not to ask whether whites who benefit from preferential treatment feel bad, implies his criticism of the media's biased narratives that seek to delegitimize affirmative action. Bond's overall satirical tone suggests that he views the media's attacks on affirmative action as unfounded and biased, and that he believes in the importance of affirmative action as a tool for addressing racial inequality and discrimination. The text conveys Bond's concern that the media often uses selective reporting to undermine the positive impact of civil rights organizations and policies like affirmative action, which are crucial for the advancement of underrepresented groups."	0.01772	affirmative action	txt/428907164.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	"the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action, as they critique the arguments presented in ""the bell curve"" which suggests abolishing affirmative action based on i.q. scores and genetics."	"The text critiques ""The Bell Curve,"" a book by Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein that discusses racial differences in I.Q. scores and their implications. The authors suggest that the lower I.Q. scores of blacks compared to whites are a significant issue, with potential policy implications such as the abolition of affirmative action and welfare. The text questions the novelty and integrity of the book's content, suggesting that it rehashes old ideas for profit and political gain, drawing comparisons to the controversial work of William Shockley, who advocated for the genetic inferiority of blacks. The book is accused of lacking original thought and offering alarmist, polarizing predictions without providing concrete solutions. It is also criticized for its dense presentation and the inclusion of simplistic summaries, which seem designed to sell the book rather than to inform.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as implied through the discussion of ""The Bell Curve,"" seems to be critical of the book's stance. The author suggests that Murray and Herrnstein's work is regressive and politically motivated, with the aim of discrediting affirmative action and welfare by tying them to I.Q. scores and genetics. The author implies that the book's approach is unscientific and oversimplifies complex societal issues, using them to promote a conservative agenda. The perspective seems to be that affirmative action is a necessary policy that should not be abolished on the basis of the questionable science and alarmist rhetoric presented in ""The Bell Curve."" The author's view leans towards a rejection of the book's implications that affirmative action should be dismantled because of innate intelligence differences among races, viewing such claims as a rehashed and unfounded assault on policies designed to address racial inequality."	0.021290000000000003	affirmative action	txt/429909301.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text is neutral on affirmative action, focusing instead on bob dole's inconsistent stance on the issue as part of a broader critique of his leadership and political strategy.	"Bob Dole, at the age of 73, was contemplating how to approach his campaign against Bill Clinton, specifically whether to intensify his attacks. During a New Jersey event, he pondered the decision to get ""tougher"" on Clinton, which he confirmed he would do in the upcoming debate. However, Dole's indecisiveness and history of changing positions have raised questions about his leadership qualities. His failure to consistently challenge Clinton on ethical issues and his wavering on topics such as affirmative action and supply-side economics have led to perceptions of him as a weak candidate unable to stand up to political adversaries or lead effectively.

The author suggests that Dole's perspective on affirmative action has been inconsistent, aligning with a broader pattern of vacillation on various issues. Despite a career-long support for affirmative action, Dole reversed his stance to align more closely with the conservative base, likening himself to Ronald Reagan. This shift appears to be a strategic move to appeal to a certain voter demographic, rather than a reflection of his genuine beliefs. The author views this as a character flaw, indicative of Dole's inability to maintain his convictions under pressure. This inconsistency contributes to the portrayal of Dole not as a decisive leader but as a politician who often compromises or changes his positions, undermining his presidential credibility."	0.0189	affirmative action	txt/430675992.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they criticize its potential abolition and suggest the need for substantive reforms rather than elimination.	"The text criticizes the U.S. Congress for considering an official apology for slavery as a superficial gesture instead of taking substantive actions to address the legacy of slavery and segregation. It points out that both major political parties avoid substantial policy discussions on race and poverty, with Republicans focusing on ending affirmative action and Democrats engaging in symbolic acts without tangible results. The author suggests that real change would involve learning from successful local leaders and implementing credible programs rather than relying on empty apologies and ineffective federal programs.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that its abolition, as pursued by the Republican Party, is not a solution to the underlying issues of racial inequality and poverty. The author believes that affirmative action should be reformed justly rather than eliminated without providing alternatives to support the disadvantaged. The text implies that the Republican stance on affirmative action is more about political popularity than addressing the root causes of educational disparities. The author seems to advocate for a more nuanced approach that would reform affirmative action while also addressing the complex issues of race and poverty in a substantive way."	0.01666	affirmative action	txt/430810646.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Albert Carnesale, the new Chancellor of UCLA, emphasizes the importance of diversity as a goal for the university, especially in light of California's new policies which prohibit race or ethnicity-based preferences in admissions. The result of these policies has been a significant decrease in the number of Hispanic and black students at UCLA Law School. Carnesale outlines three key reasons why diversity is crucial: it enhances education as students learn from each other's differences, it prepares leaders for all societal segments, and it promotes social and economic mobility through education. He discusses strategies to maintain diversity, such as outreach to minority students and long-term goals of equal educational opportunities for all children.

From the author's perspective, Carnesale is a proponent of affirmative action, viewing it as a tool to achieve the desired end of diversity within the educational environment. He believes that diversity enriches the educational experience, is a responsibility of public universities, and is fundamental to the American ethos of social and economic mobility. Carnesale's own background, rising from a Bronx tenement to advising Presidents, underscores his belief in the transformative power of education. He suggests alternative approaches to maintaining diversity, given the legislative changes, and stresses that university admissions consider a variety of factors beyond academic scores, implicitly advocating for a holistic approach to admissions that, while no longer considering race or ethnicity, still values the unique contributions of each individual to the campus community. The author seems to agree with Carnesale's view that a diverse higher education system is vital for a society that thrives on diversity."	0.01898	affirmative action	txt/430872205.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, as they recognize its role in promoting diversity and leadership among minority soldiers and suggest that it is a topic that deserves more attention in discussions about racial equality.	"In Akron, Ohio, President Clinton hosted a national town meeting on race, which, despite a lack of focus and energy, represented a significant effort to engage with America's challenging racial issues. The event, broadcasted on national television, involved 67 individuals from various walks of life discussing racial identity, affirmative action, and education. The conversation was somewhat reserved until President Clinton directly addressed Abigail Thernstrom, a panelist critical of affirmative action, by asking if she would oppose the type of affirmative action that helped General Colin Powell rise to become the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The author views affirmative action as a key element in the discussion of racial issues in the United States, noting the success of the Army's affirmative action policies in promoting diversity and leadership among minority soldiers. The author suggests that the President's direct question to Thernstrom about affirmative action highlighted a pivotal aspect of the debate, one that deserved more attention than it received. The author implies that affirmative action, as demonstrated by the Army's success, can be a powerful tool for achieving racial equality and should be examined more closely in national conversations. The author also indicates that future town meetings could benefit from better planning, focusing on specific issues with concrete examples and engaging guests, to facilitate a more open and effective dialogue on race."	0.014010000000000002	affirmative action	txt/430898745.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text, lani guinier, is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"Lani Guinier discusses the impact of affirmative action policies in California and Texas in her writing. In California, the ban on considering race and ethnicity in public college admissions led to a significant drop in the admission of black, Hispanic, and American Indian students at top universities, raising concerns about the resegregation of higher education. In contrast, Texas faced a similar federal court ruling but responded by implementing the ""10 percent plan,"" which automatically admits students in the top 10 percent of their high school class to the state's most selective public universities, regardless of their S.A.T. scores. This approach has increased enrollment eligibility for black and Mexican-American applicants and improved access for white students from rural areas. Texas officials are also working on enhancing primary education by requiring schools to report performance metrics by race, ethnicity, and economic status, which has led to a narrowing of the achievement gap among students.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, particularly when it is implemented in ways that benefit a diverse range of students and contribute to educational excellence. Guinier highlights Texas's success with the 10 percent plan as an example of an affirmative action policy that treats all groups equally and respects their aspirations. She contrasts this with California's situation, where the elimination of affirmative action has had negative consequences. The author commends Texas's broader approach to improving education, which includes accountability measures for primary schools and has led to academic improvements across various student demographics. Guinier suggests that Texas's methods are fostering a more inclusive and less polarized conversation about affirmative action and education, which she views as a move toward a more equitable and effective educational system."	0.019020000000000002	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	based on the summary, the author of the text, henry louis gates jr., appears to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its role in the growth of the black middle class while also highlighting the need for further measures to address contemporary issues like the digital divide.	"Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses the historical struggle for literacy among African Americans, starting from the prohibition of reading, writing, and ""talking drums"" after the Stono Rebellion, to the significance of literacy as a means of liberation and assertion of humanity by ex-slaves. He highlights the importance of literacy in the African-American tradition and the ongoing battle for equal access to education. Gates Jr. then transitions to the contemporary issue of the digital divide, noting that despite the decreasing costs of technology, a significant gap persists in computer ownership and Internet access between low-income African-American and Hispanic families compared to white families. He warns that this gap could lead to a form of disenfranchisement akin to a ""21st-century poll tax.""

From Gates Jr.'s perspective, affirmative action is seen as a crucial step that has helped grow the black middle class since the late 1960s, but he acknowledges that new forms of disconnectedness persist within black America. He asserts that the digital divide is not only a matter of providing affordable technology but also about creating relevant content that appeals to African Americans. Gates Jr. draws a parallel between the early recording industry's race records, which attracted black consumers, and the potential for culturally relevant web content to engage African Americans online. He suggests that the African-American community can address this form of ""cybersegregation"" by utilizing resources such as churches, mosques, and community centers to bridge the digital divide and reinforce social connections. Gates Jr. views the Internet as a modern ""talking drum,"" a tool for education and cultural expression, which African Americans must learn to utilize to avoid a new era of self-imposed segregation."	0.023740000000000004	affirmative action	txt/431248074.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Morristown, traditionally known for its Fourth of July celebrations, experienced a different kind of event when Richard Barrett, a white supremacist from Mississippi, held a rally to oppose affirmative action and minority privileges, comparing his stance to George Washington's rejection of monarchical privileges. The rally, protected by police, incited counter-protests that led to arrests and conflict. In response to Barrett's plans, the town organized a unity event at the Calvary Baptist Church, emphasizing diversity and the rejection of racial superiority. The event, which included a candlelight march, was a peaceful counter to Barrett's divisive message and was supported by the mayor and attended by residents of various backgrounds. Despite the town's efforts, tensions were evident during Barrett's rally, which was met with significant opposition and confrontations.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of Barrett's anti-affirmative action stance, as the text describes Barrett's rally as ""anemic"" and his interpretation of the Declaration of Independence as ""racist."" The author highlights the town's proactive approach to celebrating diversity and unity as a counter-narrative to Barrett's divisive rhetoric. This suggests that the author values the principles of diversity and inclusion and sees affirmative action as a means to uphold those principles. The contrast between the town's peaceful celebration of diversity and the conflict at Barrett's rally illustrates the author's belief in the importance of community solidarity and the rejection of bigotry, indicating support for the ideals that affirmative action seeks to promote."	0.02006	affirmative action	txt/431493919.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"Dr. Allan J. Formicola, retiring as dean of the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery, has used his tenure to increase minority enrollment and expand dental care access in Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood. His approach to leadership has been inclusive, reaching out to minority alumni and integrating community service into the school's mission. Under his guidance, minority enrollment has increased, and the school has established community health centers, dental clinics in schools, and a mobile dental care unit. Dr. Formicola's work has been recognized as an effort to bridge the gap between Columbia University and the surrounding communities, especially given the historical tension between the two.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is conveyed through the narrative of Dr. Formicola's career and actions, which serve as an implicit response to the debate surrounding affirmative action and inequality. The author seems to view Dr. Formicola's initiatives as a positive and effective means of addressing these issues, highlighting the importance of those in positions of power taking active roles in supporting underrepresented communities. The increase in minority enrollment and the provision of dental care to underserved areas are presented as successful outcomes of a commitment to affirmative action principles. The author implies that the continuation of Dr. Formicola's legacy at Columbia is crucial for maintaining progress in diversity and community engagement within the field of dentistry."	0.018779999999999998	affirmative action	txt/431879654.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author is somewhat against affirmative action.	"Summary:
Trent Lott, a U.S. Senator, found himself in political trouble following controversial remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party that were perceived as supportive of Thurmond's segregationist past. In an attempt to salvage his position, Lott made several overtures that seemed out of step with his party's ideology, including endorsing affirmative action and suggesting a holiday to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. The author criticizes the media and political leaders for failing to hold Lott accountable for his long-standing associations with white supremacist groups, a fact that was reported years earlier by columnist Stanley Crouch but largely ignored. The scandal revealed a broader issue within the Republican Party, where certain leaders were seen as pandering to racist sentiments for political gain. The author argues that the party's use of race in politics is not a thing of the past and cites examples of racially charged tactics in recent elections. The author also critiques President Bush's ""affirmative access"" and ""compassionate conservatism"" as ineffective and mere public relations strategies, and suggests that the Republican Party is more concerned with appeasing white voters than genuinely addressing issues important to black Americans.

Author's Perspective on Affirmative Action:
The author appears to view affirmative action as a political tool that is sometimes used insincerely or superficially by politicians seeking to recover from racially insensitive missteps. In the context of Trent Lott's scandal, the senator's sudden advocacy for ""across the board"" affirmative action is presented as a desperate and disingenuous attempt to regain favor, rather than a genuine commitment to the policy. The author implies that such overtures are empty gestures, particularly when they come from individuals or parties with a history of racially divisive politics. The broader critique suggests a cynicism toward how affirmative action is leveraged by some politicians, who may not support the principle of the policy but use it as a means to deflect criticism or to appear morally superior without enacting substantive changes that would benefit minority communities."	0.03268	affirmative action	txt/432267882.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text, james o. freedman, is strongly in favor of affirmative action.	"James O. Freedman, the retired president of Dartmouth College, staunchly defends the value of a liberal education despite the trend of undergraduates favoring more practical subjects. He argues that a liberal education not only helps individuals understand themselves and society but also provides a significant advantage in the job market due to the critical thinking and writing skills it cultivates. Freedman, who is currently battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, remains focused on advocating for liberal values and education through his writing and public speaking. His recent book, ""Liberal Education and the Public Interest,"" underscores his commitment to these ideals. Despite his health challenges, Freedman continues to contribute to the academic community and engage in intellectual discussions, as evidenced by his friendship with Harvard educational psychologist Howard Gardner.

From the author's perspective, affirmative action is a critical component for the future of America as it is essential for educating minority men and women. Freedman has put his legal knowledge to work by helping to prepare a brief for the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. His tenure as president of Dartmouth was marked by efforts to make the college more inclusive, welcoming a diverse range of students and standing up against intolerance on campus. His actions demonstrate a deep belief in the importance of diversity and equal opportunity in education, reflecting his broader commitment to liberal values and the public interest."	0.02366	affirmative action	txt/432317583.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, given the focus on justice o'connor's potential empathy with minority applicants and the consideration of her personal experiences with discrimination.	"Kirk Kolbo argued before the Supreme Court that affirmative action is unconstitutional, but was challenged by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who questioned the absolute nature of his argument against using race as a factor in university admissions. The cases against the University of Michigan's undergraduate and law school programs had built momentum over five years, but O'Connor's critical stance during the hearing suggested she might not support the argument against affirmative action. Outside the court, protests and signs indicated the historical significance of the proceedings, with many advocating for equal opportunity.

From the author's perspective, Justice O'Connor is portrayed as a pivotal figure in the affirmative action debate, often serving as the swing vote on the Supreme Court. Despite her conservative background and some decisions that have been perceived as unsympathetic or even callous, O'Connor has a history of considering the real-world effects of rulings and avoiding the overturning of major precedents. The author suggests that O'Connor's own experiences with gender discrimination and her appointment to the Supreme Court, which can be viewed as a form of affirmative action, may influence her to empathize with minority applicants benefiting from affirmative action policies. The author implies that O'Connor's reluctance to dismantle established precedents, along with her personal journey, might lead her to side with the University of Michigan and uphold affirmative action."	0.02093	affirmative action	txt/432374988.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text seems somewhat against affirmative action, expressing criticism of how it might have been misapplied in the case of jayson blair, but also recognizing the value of diversity in journalism.	"The text is an email from a New York Times writer expressing dismay over the deceit and plagiarism committed by reporter Jayson Blair, which is considered a low point in the newspaper's history. The Times has front-paged the investigation into Blair's misconduct, which includes fake interviews and articles. The writer questions how Blair's behavior went unchecked despite numerous red flags, suggesting that Blair was given too many chances because he was an ambitious black journalist. The executive editor, Howell Raines, is committed to transparency and addressing the breakdown in communication that allowed Blair's deceit to continue. The writer also discusses the reactions in Washington, noting the schadenfreude among conservatives who criticize the Times for being duped and suggest that affirmative action policies contributed to the scandal.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical yet nuanced. They acknowledge that Blair's race and the Times's commitment to diversity might have played a role in the leniency he received, which conservatives argue is an example of affirmative action backfiring. However, the author counters this by emphasizing the importance of diversity in journalism and the media's responsibility to represent a wider range of voices, including black, Hispanic, and Asian journalists. The author suggests that the scandal should not be used to discredit the value of diversity but rather as a learning opportunity for the Times and other journalistic institutions to improve their practices without turning away from the commitment to diversity."	0.019200000000000002	affirmative action	txt/432405735.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text seems to be somewhat in favor of affirmative action, recognizing its necessity in the short term while also advocating for systemic changes to address educational disparities in the long term.	"The Supreme Court upheld affirmative action in university admissions with the expectation that racial preferences would not be necessary after 25 years, according to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion. The decision raises questions about whether this timeframe will become a legal mandate and what measures should be taken to achieve educational parity. The text discusses various viewpoints on how to close educational achievement gaps between white and minority students, including the impact of school financing, social inequality, and student study habits. The disparities are highlighted by consistent gaps in standardized test scores and educational progress despite some efforts to bridge the divide. There is debate over whether equalizing funding or focusing on other aspects of education would be more effective in closing these gaps.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that while it's a necessary measure to address current inequalities, it is not a long-term solution. The author acknowledges the complexities involved in achieving educational parity, such as the interplay between school financing and broader socioeconomic factors. The text implies that affirmative action is a stopgap measure, and there is a need for systemic changes in education to address the root causes of the achievement gap. The author also highlights the differing opinions on affirmative action and the need for a commitment from both society and minority families to make substantive progress. There is a recognition that without significant changes in education and social structures, affirmative action may still be needed beyond the 25-year timeframe suggested by Justice O'Connor."	0.03089	affirmative action	txt/432415722.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions and their alignment with public sentiment, suggesting that the Court has shown moderation despite expectations of conservative rulings. The author notes the Court upheld affirmative action in university admissions with a 5-to-4 vote and recognized gay sexual relations as constitutionally protected in a 6-to-3 decision. The Court also supported state workers' rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act, deviating from its previous states' rights focus. However, the Court upheld California's ""three strikes"" law in a case involving a minor theft, which the author criticizes as a failure to protect the marginalized. The term's decisions reflect a range from far-right conservatism to liberal centrism, without a strong push from the left. The final week's rulings on affirmative action and sodomy laws are anticipated to motivate conservative activists to seek more extreme justices for future vacancies.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is favorable. They view the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the University of Michigan's race-conscious admissions policy as a ratification of the national consensus and a moderate stance that aligns with the broader public opinion. The author suggests that the Court's decision reflects a balanced approach, avoiding extreme conservatism and maintaining the ability of institutions to consider race as one of many factors in admissions. This perspective implies support for the principles of affirmative action as a means of promoting diversity and equality in educational opportunities. The author also warns against the potential impact of appointing more extremely conservative justices who could shift the balance of the Court and possibly overturn affirmative action, among other rights. Overall, the author appreciates the Court's moderation and cautions against any drastic shifts in its composition that could disrupt what they see as a reflection of the best instincts of the American people."	0.02017	affirmative action	txt/432419685.xml.txt
	None	the author, sam tanenhaus, does not express a direct opinion on affirmative action in the provided text. therefore, he should be categorized as not concerned with affirmative action based on this summary.	"Sam Tanenhaus discusses the internal conflict within the Democratic Party, where liberal presidential candidates are clashing with moderate party leaders over the direction of the party. Democratic officials are cautioning against extremism, fearing a repeat of past electoral defeats, while liberals argue that the party should energize its base, much like the Republicans have done successfully in the past. Tanenhaus suggests that the top Democratic contenders are not genuinely radical and that the fear of a far-left takeover may be exaggerated. He also questions the role of ideology in presidential elections, citing that voters' opinions are not always consistent or ideologically driven, as seen in the varying policies supported during the Reagan and Clinton administrations.

From the author's perspective, Tanenhaus appears to be critical of the Democratic leadership's cautious approach towards its more liberal faction. He argues that passion and energy, often brought by those with strong beliefs, are essential to political success. He references the 1964 Republican campaign where Barry Goldwater, despite being labeled an extremist, laid the groundwork for a conservative resurgence that eventually led to Ronald Reagan's victory. Tanenhaus suggests that Democrats should learn from this historical example and recognize the potential value in listening to the more zealous voices within their party, rather than dismissing them. He points out the irony of the current situation, where the traditionally elite-oriented Republican Party has embraced its populist activists, while the Democratic Party, historically aligned with ""the people,"" seems wary of its own fervent supporters."	0.024390000000000002	affirmative action	txt/432471477.xml.txt
4	strongly_in_favor	the author of the text appears to be strongly in favor of affirmative action, as he emphasizes the importance of legal protections against group-based discrimination and criticizes the misinterpretation of landmark cases that could support race-conscious government action to combat systemic oppression.	"Ian Haney Lopez commemorates the 50th anniversary of Hernandez v. Texas, a Supreme Court case that extended constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans and established a standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination. He argues that this case, which dealt with jury discrimination against Mexican-Americans, was significant because it established that constitutional protection applies when groups suffer subordination, regardless of racial distinctions. The case demonstrated the systematic discrimination Mexican-Americans faced in Texas, akin to the Jim Crow laws that oppressed African Americans, and it set a precedent for understanding discrimination beyond just race.

The author criticizes the contemporary reading of Brown v. Board of Education, suggesting that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted it to oppose only the state's use of formal racial distinctions, rather than systematic oppression. He emphasizes that Brown's anti-caste commitment has been distorted, allowing the court to erect barriers against race-conscious government action while ignoring situations where racism is implicit. Lopez points out that Chief Justice Earl Warren, in the Brown decision, failed to explicitly state that the protection was due to oppression, not just race. He suggests that Hernandez v. Texas already provided a clear directive against racial subordination that should be at the forefront of 14th Amendment law, alongside Brown, to effectively combat discrimination."	0.020960000000000003	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt
	None	the provided summary does not offer enough information to categorize the author's perspective on affirmative action. the summary discusses various political topics and campaign events but does not provide a clear stance or opinion on affirmative action itself. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action cannot be determined from the given summary.	"The text provided is a series of questions and answers related to political events and figures, specifically focusing on statements made by President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, as well as various campaign strategies and advertisements used during a political campaign. The questions cover topics such as Bush's comments on Osama bin Laden, Kerry's response to a report on Bush's IQ, proposed plans to save Social Security, and the influence of celebrity endorsements on voter decisions. The answers to these questions reveal the correct responses to the quiz, including Bush's lack of concern about bin Laden, Kerry's humorous take on Bush's intelligence, Bush's proposal to allow private savings accounts for Social Security, and Kerry's use of the phrase ""a coalition of the coerced and the bribed"" to describe Bush's allies in the Iraq War. Additionally, Hans Blix is identified as a former United Nations weapons inspector.

From the author's perspective on affirmative action, it can be inferred that the author views President Bush's stance on the issue as a significant factor in his political ideology. The fact that the question about Bush finding a Supreme Court justice's support for affirmative action unacceptable is included alongside other serious and facetious options suggests that the author recognizes the importance of this issue in the broader context of Bush's political views and judicial appointments. The inclusion of this question indicates that the author considers the President's position on affirmative action to be a noteworthy aspect of his policy preferences and potentially a point of contention or interest for the audience."	0.02604	affirmative action	txt/432876223.xml.txt
2	neutral	the author of the text appears to be neutral regarding affirmative action, as they do not explicitly express a stance but rather report on the controversy and perspectives of others within the context of harvard university and lawrence summers' presidency.	"The text discusses the controversy surrounding Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, following his comments on the potential innate differences in scientific aptitude between men and women. The incident, referred to as Gendergate, sparked protests and debates about the university's identity as either liberal or conservative. The article delves into various campus issues, such as the low number of tenured women professors, expansion plans, and the handling of the university's endowment, which are all viewed through a political lens. Summers, a former Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, is described as conservative in the context of the university, pushing for changes that challenge the liberal status quo. His tenure has been marked by confrontations and a desire to make the university more efficient through stronger administrative control.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is a contentious issue at Harvard, with liberals advocating for its use to address the low number of tenured women professors and conservatives opposing it. The article contrasts Summers's approach with that of his predecessors, Neil Rudenstine and Derek Bok, who were more devoted to inclusivity and affirmative action, respectively. Summers's actions, such as rebuking Cornel West and questioning campus anti-Semitism, have led to accusations of him being against affirmative action and dictatorial. The debate over Summers's stance on affirmative action is reflective of the broader left-right divide at Harvard, and it is implicated in the broader cultural and political wars of the time. The author implies that the university's handling of these issues, including affirmative action, will shape its future amidst the ongoing culture war."	0.02585	affirmative action	txt/432991807.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author's perspective on affirmative action is somewhat against or critical, as they highlight the perceived double standards and ironies in its application, particularly in the context of john mccain's background.	"The text is a critique of various political figures who are portrayed as envious of Barack Obama's rise in the political arena. Bill Clinton is described as begrudging Obama despite his own history of racial politics. Jesse Jackson is seen as having an outdated approach to civil rights that involves leveraging white guilt, which is being overshadowed by Obama's new approach. John McCain is depicted as jealous and abandoning his principles for an honor-based campaign, resorting to petty attacks and a lack of substance in his presidential campaign against Obama. McCain's change in strategy is attributed to his envy of Obama's celebrity status and intellectual prowess, contrasting with his own image as a maverick. The author also suggests that McCain's campaign has become negative and desperate under the guidance of his new strategist, Steve Schmidt.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical and nuanced, particularly in the context of John McCain's background. They highlight the irony in McCain's criticism of Obama, noting that McCain himself is an ""affirmative action scion of admirals"" who may have benefited from his family legacy to get through Annapolis, while Obama did not mention his race on his Harvard Law School application. This suggests the author believes that affirmative action, or the perception of it, is not limited to racial minorities but can also extend to those with privileged backgrounds. The mention of affirmative action in this context serves to undermine McCain's insinuations about Obama and to point out the double standards in how advantages are perceived based on race and family legacy."	0.021190000000000004	affirmative action	txt/433917131.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text, helene cooper, can be categorized as somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The text discusses the impact of affirmative action policies initiated in 1969 by top American universities aiming to diversify their student bodies. These policies have led to the emergence of a new elite, including prominent figures such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Sonia Sotomayor, and Valerie Jarrett, who have benefited from these affirmative action initiatives. The author reflects on the unresolved issues surrounding these changes, as highlighted by the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the complex, often ambiguous status of those who, like the author, were part of the first wave of affirmative action at elite institutions.

The author, Helene Cooper, presents a nuanced perspective on affirmative action. While recognizing the opportunities it has provided, she also acknowledges the internal conflicts and feelings of inadequacy it can create among its beneficiaries. Cooper discusses the ""double consciousness"" experienced by the children of 1969, who must navigate between their ethnic identities and the predominantly white world of elite universities. She suggests that this ability to move between worlds has given them unique advantages, but also comes with its own set of challenges. Cooper's view is that affirmative action has been a necessary phase for broader integration and for the possibility of an African-American president like Barack Obama. However, she also points out that life outside the university does not always reflect the inclusive environment of academic institutions, and that being black can still trump all other identities in American society. The author hopes that incidents like that of Professor Gates can become ""teachable moments"" for America to engage with race in a new and constructive way."	0.027430000000000003	affirmative action	txt/434126284.xml.txt
3	somewhat_in_favor	the author of the text is somewhat in favor of affirmative action.	"The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to review several nominees for federal judgeships again due to Republican obstruction. These nominees, including the notable Goodwin Liu, had been previously approved by the committee but were blocked from a full Senate vote and had their nominations returned to the White House under an obscure rule. Liu, an accomplished legal scholar with a strong academic and professional background, is opposed by Republicans largely because of his progressive views on issues like same-sex marriage, affirmative action, and the Constitution as a living document. Despite being within the mainstream and showing flexibility in his thinking, as evidenced by his support for school vouchers and charter schools, his confirmation is uncertain. The text compares the current confirmation rate of President Obama's nominees unfavorably with that during President George W. Bush's tenure, highlighting the unusual level of obstruction faced by Obama's judicial nominees.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred to be positive, as they categorize Goodwin Liu's support for the policy as part of his mainstream legal and political views. The author implies that Liu's backing of affirmative action should not be a disqualifying factor for his nomination as a federal judge, suggesting that the author views affirmative action as a legitimate and acceptable aspect of contemporary legal discourse. The author criticizes the Republican opposition to Liu and other nominees, suggesting that the Republicans' actions are politically motivated rather than based on the nominees' qualifications or judicial philosophy. The author's mention of affirmative action in the context of Liu's broader progressive stance indicates a belief that such policies are an integral part of a fair and evolving legal system."	0.015920000000000004	affirmative action	txt/752088707.xml.txt
1	somewhat_against	the author of the text is somewhat against affirmative action.	"The text reflects on the controversial 1991 Anita Hill testimony during Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court nomination and its aftermath. The author expresses skepticism about the lasting significance of Hill's allegations of sexual harassment and questions why she did not raise concerns earlier or take action at the time. The text also touches on recent events, including a call from Thomas's wife, Ginni, to Hill, and the emergence of Lillian McEwen, a former girlfriend of Thomas, who corroborates Hill's account. The author suggests that these events have led to a reexamination of the past and highlights Thomas's personal history as detailed in his memoir.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as mentioned in the text, is critical. They suggest that Clarence Thomas's true ""offense"" was not the allegations of sexual harassment but rather his conservative stance on issues like affirmative action, which he believed might be detrimental to its intended beneficiaries. The author implies that Thomas's conservative views, particularly as a black man, were the real reason for the scrutiny he faced during his nomination process. The text conveys a sense of sympathy for Thomas, portraying him as a victim of political and spiritual battles, and suggests that his wife's recent actions may be a cry for resolution of past traumas. The author seems to advocate for moving beyond the scandal and recognizing Thomas's personal growth and contributions to the Supreme Court."	0.018930000000000002	affirmative action	txt/759996654.xml.txt
	None	the author of the text does not directly express their own view on affirmative action and is more focused on the political tactics surrounding robert bork's nomination. therefore, the author's perspective on affirmative action would be categorized as not concerned.	"The text recounts the events surrounding Robert Bork's failed nomination to the Supreme Court 24 years prior to the date of the article. Bork was a highly qualified candidate with a strong legal background, including roles as a Yale law professor, solicitor general, and federal appeals court judge. He was known for his originalist views and opposition to decisions like Roe v. Wade. His nomination was rejected by the Senate, with most Democrats voting against him. The author suggests that the tactics used to oppose Bork's nomination marked the beginning of a decline in civil discourse in politics, leading to an era of heightened partisanship and obstructionism.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as gleaned from the text, is that Bork himself saw the court's rulings on the matter as problematic. The author does not directly express their own view on affirmative action but implies that Bork’s views, while conservative, were not extreme and that his perspective on such issues contributed to the fierce opposition he faced. The author criticizes the Democrats for their strategy during Bork's nomination, implying that they engaged in character assassination and unfair tactics to prevent his confirmation. This, according to the author, set a precedent for future political battles and the current polarized state of American politics. The author suggests that the demonization of Bork was a strategic move to prevent a conservative shift in the Supreme Court rather than a fair assessment of his qualifications or judicial philosophy."	0.02096	affirmative action	txt/900173941.xml.txt
