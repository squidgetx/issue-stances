The authors express support for affirmative action, but with a specific focus on increasing political pluralism and conservative representation in academia. They argue that the principles of diversity and a range of perspectives, which underpin affirmative action, should also be extended to include conservative voices in universities. They suggest that affirmative action could be a tool to correct the political homogeneity in certain academic fields, which they believe is detrimental to the pursuit of truth and the modeling of civil discourse.

1	favor	"The author’s stance on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text provided. The author acknowledges the right of law Professor Lino Graglia to oppose affirmative action and criticizes Graglia for his remarks that could be interpreted as suggesting that minority underachievement is inescapable. However, the author also points out the importance of considering socioeconomic circumstances, the history of discrimination, and the potential for minority groups to improve their situation over time, as demonstrated by the example of Italian-Americans.

The author emphasizes the need for education through dialogue and the inclusion of a variety of viewpoints in discussions about race, rather than outright condemnation. While the author does not directly state their position on affirmative action, they suggest that a more nuanced and informed conversation is necessary, one that accounts for historical and socioeconomic factors affecting minority achievement.

Based on the text, the author appears to favor a more complex and understanding approach to the issue of minority achievement and the factors that influence it, rather than a simple for or against stance on affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance is best classified as None, as they do not clearly express support or opposition to affirmative action, but rather advocate for a deeper discussion on the related issues."	0.01637	affirmative action	txt/418468478.xml.txt	1

The text presents a critical analysis of affirmative action, discussing its limitations and unintended consequences. However, the author also acknowledges the complexities of racial and gender discrimination and the importance of addressing these issues.

The author critiques affirmative action for not addressing broader economic disparities and for potentially benefiting more affluent members of minority groups rather than those most in need. The text also suggests that affirmative action can create a zero-sum game where opportunities are redistributed rather than expanded.

Despite the criticism, the author recognizes the historical context of racial inequality and the potential negative impact of abruptly ending affirmative action programs. The call for a balanced debate and an approach that honors the truths of both supporters and opponents of affirmative action indicates a desire for a more equitable solution that addresses both class and race issues.

Given the complexity of the author's perspective, which includes elements of critique as well as an understanding of the need for programs that promote equality, the stance can be classified as ""None"" because it does not fit neatly into a position of being either entirely ""Against"" or entirely ""In Favor"" of affirmative action. The author is calling for a more comprehensive approach to equality of opportunity that transcends the limitations of affirmative action as it is currently implemented."	0.01976	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	2

Despite the lack of a direct statement supporting affirmative action, the overall tone and context suggest that the author is critical of the Supreme Court's conservative majority and its decisions on various issues, including affirmative action. Therefore, the author's stance can be inferred to be in Favor of affirmative action, based on the criticism of the court's actions that are perceived to undermine such policies."	0.02042	affirmative action	txt/2832640273.xml.txt	3

The author, Henry Louis Gates Jr., expresses a stance that is in favor of affirmative action.
