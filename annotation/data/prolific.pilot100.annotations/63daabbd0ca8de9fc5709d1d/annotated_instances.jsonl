In this article, we discuss a different type of partisan polarization underappreciated by scholars: \u201cbelief polarization,\u201d or disagreements over what people perceive to be true.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of belief polarization has been defined in a number of ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their May 2021 paper, \u201cBelief polarization in a complex world,\u201d Alan Jern, Kai-min Kevin Chang and Charles Kemp \u2014 of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Melbourne \u2014 write: \u201cBelief polarization occurs when two people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, they continue, \u201cample evidence that people sustain different beliefs even when faced with the same information, and they interpret that information differently.\u201d They also note that \u201cstark differences in beliefs can arise and endure due to human limitations in interpreting complex information.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kristoffer Nimark, an economist at Cornell, and Savitar Sundaresan, of Imperial College London, describe belief polarization this way: \u201cThe beliefs of ex ante identical agents over time can cluster in two distinct groups at opposite ends of the belief space.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scott F. Aikin and Robert B. Talisse, professors of philosophy at Vanderbilt, argue in their 2019 paper \u2014 \u201cHow Does Belief Polarization Work\u201d \u2014 that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of what makes belief polarization so disconcerting is its ubiquity. It has been extensively studied for more than 50 years and found to be operative within groups of all kinds, formal and informal. Furthermore, belief polarization does not discriminate between different kinds of belief. Like-minded groups polarize regardless of whether they are discussing banal matters of fact, matters of personal taste, or questions about value. What\u2019s more, the phenomenon operates regardless of the explicit point of the group\u2019s discussion. Like-minded groups polarize when they are trying to decide an action that the group will take; and they polarize also when there is no specific decision to be reached. Finally, the phenomenon is prevalent regardless of group members\u2019 nationality, race, gender, religion, economic status, and level of education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talisse, writing separately, observes that:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The social environment itself can trigger extremity shifts. These prompts need not be verbal, explicit, or literal; they can be merely implicit signals to group members that some belief is prevalent among them \u2014 hats, pins, campaign signs, logos, and gestures are all potential initiators of belief polarization. Further, as corroboration is really a matter of numbers, those with the power to present the appearance of widespread acceptance among a particular social group of some idea thereby have the power to induce extremity shifts among those who identify with that group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most salient recent illustration of belief polarization is the diametrically opposed view of Trump loyalists and of their Democratic adversaries over the legitimacy of the 2020 election: Trump supporters are convinced it was stolen; Democrats and independents are certain that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, politicians on the right \u2014 and Fox News \u2014 are treating the F.B.I. raid on Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago on Monday as a corrupt politicization of federal investigative authority while liberals \u2014 and CNN \u2014 counter that the raid demonstrates that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay and her colleagues expand the scope of belief polarization to look at the differences between Republicans and Democrats over the causes of inequality:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We illustrate large, and increasing, partisan divides in beliefs regarding whether an unequal society, or unequal behavior, is the cause of socioeconomic inequality. Republican politicians and citizens are optimistic about the American dream and pessimistic about poor people\u2019s behavior; Democratic politicians and citizens are pessimistic about the Dream and optimistic about poor people\u2019s ability to succeed if given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These patterns, Suhay and her collaborators continue,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>hold for beliefs about economic inequality along both class and race lines. Variation in societal versus individual blame is consistently associated with views on social welfare, taxation, and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. We conclude that Americans\u2019 beliefs about the fairness of the economy represent a crucial component of a redistributive versus anti-redistributive ideology that is increasingly associated with the two political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay writes that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic Party has long justified its left-leaning economic policies with two central claims: significant economic inequality exists between individuals and social groups, and these great inequalities are unfair because society, not individuals, are to blame for them. The latter proposition is especially important. It is difficult to deny that many harsh inequalities exist in the United States. Exorbitant wealth as well as homelessness are plain to see. However, such inequalities might be tolerated if they are viewed as the outcome of a meritocratic system. Democrats argue instead that \u201cthe American dream\u201d \u2014 success via hard work \u2014 is not a reality for many. Thus, low-income people deserve government assistance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, Suhay continues, Republicans emphasize</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>aggregate economic growth and downplay the extent of inequality. Second, Republicans argue that existing inequalities are fair \u2014 successful people have achieved success via hard work or ingenuity, and those facing difficult economic circumstances are to blame for them. Third, in response to Democrats\u2019 instinct to use government to combat inequality, Republicans argue government efforts to intervene in business affairs, redistribute wealth, and assist those in need often do more harm than good, depressing the economic output of both firms and individuals. These narratives justify Republicans\u2019 conservative economic agenda by insisting that the status quo is fine: inequality is minimal; inequalities that do exist are \u201cjust deserts\u201d; and, even if one wished to help, government intervention in fact undermines individual and aggregate prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay, Tenenbaum and Bartola cite data from American National Election Studies and the Pew Research Center to track the increasing polarization between Republicans and Democrats on various questions, which require respondents to agree or disagree with statements like these: \u201cone of the big problems in this country is that we don\u2019t give everyone an equal chance\u201d; \u201cmost people who want to get ahead can make it if they\u2019re willing to work hard\u201d; and \u201cpoor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, 68 percent of Republican and 43 percent of Democratic survey respondents chose \u201chave it easy,\u201d a 25-point difference. By 2017, 73 percent of Republicans said the poor \u201chave it easy,\u201d while 19 percent of Democrats shared that view, 54-points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Suhay noted that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>many social scientists today are focused on misinformed and extreme beliefs in the Republican Party, including Republicans\u2019 greater likelihood of rejecting climate science and COVID-19 vaccination and their embrace of Trump\u2019s \u2018big lie\u2019 about the 2020 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, Suhay wrote by email, many of those same scholars \u201care missing growing extremity on the political left. It may be more benign or even beneficial in some cases, but it is still a phenomenon worth study.\u201d In addition to \u201ca surge of claims on the left that the economy is extremely unequal and that this is because our country does not provide equal opportunity to all of its inhabitants,\u201d there has been a parallel surge among liberals on the issue of \u201cracial justice \u2014 in both the economic and criminal justice arena.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A third development on the left, Suhay added, and one</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>where we have seen the most rapid change, is around gender identity. Democrats increasingly say society ought to protect the rights of transgender people and the expression of transgender identity because gender fluidity is a natural part of the human condition and trying to curb its expression causes people harm. The popularity of each of these views has surged on the left recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is further evidence that even people who are knowledgeable about complex issues are sharply polarized along partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Lee at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Brendan Nyhan at Dartmouth, Jason Reifler at the University of Exeter and D.J. Flynn at IE University in Madrid, argue in their paper \u201cMore Accurate, but No Less Polarized: Comparing the Factual Beliefs of Government Officials and the Public\u201d that while \u201cpolitical elites are consistently more accurately informed than the public,\u201d the \u201cincrease in accuracy does not translate into reduced factual belief polarization. These findings demonstrate that a more informed political elite does not necessarily mitigate partisan factual disagreement in policymaking.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lee, Nyhan, Reifler and Flynn assessed the views of elites through a survey in 2017 of 743 \u201celected policymakers, legislative staffers, and top administrative positions in local and state government in the United States.\u201d Three quarters of the sample held elective office. The survey tested belief accuracy by partisanship and elite status on eight issues including health care, the share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent, climate change and voter fraud.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their conclusions run counter to assumptions that elites are less polarized than the general public because \u201cthey tend to be more knowledgeable, which is associated with greater belief accuracy\u201d and because they \u201cpossess domain expertise in politics and public policy that could reduce the influence of cognitive biases.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, Lee and colleagues counter, \u201cbelief polarization can be unchanged or widen when belief accuracy increases.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked Nyhan about the consequences of the findings and he wrote back by email:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important contribution of our study is to challenge the assumption that we will disagree less about the facts if we know more. Elites are better informed than the public on average but Democrats and Republicans still are still deeply divided in their beliefs about those facts. In some ways, the conclusion of our study is optimistic \u2014 government officials are better informed than the public. That\u2019s what most of us would hope to be true. But the findings do suggest we should avoid thinking that people becoming more informed will make the factual divides in our society go away. Belief polarization is a reality that is not easily overcome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One theme that emerges repeatedly in looking at belief polarization is the role race plays as a central factor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter K. Enns and Ashley Jardina, political scientists at Cornell and Duke, make the case in their October 2021 paper, \u201cComplicating the role of White racial attitudes and anti-immigrant sentiment in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the research on the relationship between white racial attitudes and Trump support is part of a tradition that assumes that racial attitudes are fairly stable predispositions that form early in life and then later become important for political reasoning. Implied in this line of research is that politicians or political campaigns do not change levels of prejudice, but they can prime these attitudes, or make them more or less salient and therefore more or less politically relevant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enns and Jardina write that, in contrast to this view, over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign \u201cmany whites shifted their survey responses on questions related to race and immigration to align with their support for Trump or Clinton.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To test their argument, the authors used \u201ca unique panel data set from surveys conducted by YouGov of more than 5,000 respondents interviewed at multiple points during the 2016 presidential election campaign.\u201d From that study, they found that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong link between white attitudes toward Black Americans and Trump support observed in prior studies is likely due as much to white Trump supporters updating their survey responses to report opinions more consistent with Trump\u2019s, as it is to Trump drawing support from more racially antagonistic white voters. Similar results emerge with respect to whites\u2019 immigration opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They found, for example, that from January 2016 to August 2016, the percentage of Trump supporters voicing strong opposition to Black Lives Matter grew by roughly 15 percentage points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Enns contended that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>regardless of the precise underlying mechanisms (and multiple mechanisms could be at work), the evidence suggests that Trump\u2019s rhetoric had a meaningful effect on the views his supporters expressed about these issues. We are definitely arguing that the attitudes individuals express can be changed by what candidates they support say and do. Although we cannot observe actual beliefs, to the extent that expressing previously unexpressed beliefs has a reinforcing effect, that would also provide evidence of a deepening or potential changing of racial attitudes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong association between Trump support and whites\u2019 views on racial issues, Enns and Jardina argue in their paper,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>was not merely a result of Trump attracting racist whites by way of his own racist rhetoric or a reflection of partisan racial sorting that had already occurred; it was also a result of white Trump supporters changing their views to be more in line with Trump\u2019s over the course of his presidential campaign. In other words, Trump not only attracted whites with more conservative views on race; he also made his white supporters more likely to espouse increasingly extreme views on issues related to immigration and on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement and police killings of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew M. Engelhardt, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina\u2014Greensboro, developed a similar line of analysis in his January 2020 paper, \u201cRacial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Engelhardt wrote:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the reason White Democrats and White Republicans hold increasingly different views about Black Americans is due to their partisanship. It\u2019s not just that Democrats with negative views became Republicans, or Republicans with more positive views became Democrats. Rather, people are changing their attitudes, and part of this, I argue, is due to how politicians talk about Black Americans. Republicans, for instance, could have internalized Trump\u2019s negative rhetoric, and increasingly held more negative views. Democrats, similarly, hear Trump say these negative things and they move opposite, holding more positive views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his paper, Engelhardt wrote that undergirding past studies of the role of race in politics and policymaking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>is an assumption that racial animus feeds political conflict. I turn this conventional wisdom on its head by arguing that political conflict can shape racial attitudes \u2014 people\u2019s views and beliefs about groups understood to be racial. Political scientists have failed to examine this possibility, perhaps because racial attitudes are seen as persistent and influential predispositions that form during childhood, long before most Americans become political animals. According to this line of reasoning, individuals use these early formed attitudes to make sense of politics; racial attitudes lead to partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ever-growing divide between left and right extends well beyond racial issues and attitudes. In his email, Engelhardt wrote that his results are \u201csuggestive of partisanship motivating changes in other orientations which we might presumably see as more stable and core to individuals.\u201d He cited research showing that \u201cpartisanship influences religiosity and religious affiliation\u201d and other studies linking \u201cpolitical concerns to changes in racial self-identification.\u201d Engelhardt added that he has \u201csome unpublished results where I find partisanship leads Democrats to hold more positive views of gay men and lesbians, transgender individuals, and feminists, over time, with Republicans holding more negative views of these groups in the same period (data range 2016-2020).\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their January 2022 paper, \u201cThe Origins and Consequences of Racialized Schemas about U.S. Parties,\u201d Kirill Zhirkov and Nicholas Valentino, political scientists at the Universities of Virginia and Michigan, make an interesting argument, that, in effect, \u201cTwo parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zhirkov and Valentino continue:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in the 1970s, Democratic candidates in presidential elections started to attract large/ shares of nonwhite voters whereas Republicans increasingly relied on votes of racially conservative whites. Over the same period, voters\u2019 positions on seemingly nonracial political issues have gradually become more intertwined with racial resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the two scholars write,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the growing racial gap between the Democratic and Republican support bases leads to formation of racialized stereotypes about the two parties. Specifically, a non-trivial share of American electorate currently views the Democratic Party as nonwhite and the Republican Party as white, though in reality whites continue to be a majority of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This \u201cimagined racial coalition of each party,\u201d in the view of Zhirkov and Valentino,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>carries profound implications for the ongoing discussion in the discipline about affective polarization in American politics: whites feel colder toward the Democratic Party when they imagine its coalition to be more heavily made up on nonwhites and feel warmer toward the Republican Party when they perceive it to be dominated by their racial group. As a consequence, rather than a cause, they may then come to accept a more conservative issue package advocated by the modern Republican Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racial attitudes, the authors argue persuasively, \u201care now important predictors of opinions about electoral fairness, gun control, policing, international trade and health care.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, Zhirkov and Valentino note, long-range implications for the future of democracy here:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon as ethnic parties start to compete for political power, winning \u2014 rather than implementing a certain policy \u2014 becomes the goal in and of itself due to associated boost in group status and self-esteem of its members. Moreover, comparative evidence suggests that U.S. plurality-based electoral system contributes to politicization of ethnic cleavages rather than mitigates them. Therefore, the racialization of American parties is likely to continue, and the intensity of political conflict in the United States is likely to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked the authors how they would characterize the importance of race in contemporary American politics. In a jointly written email, they replied that in research to be published in the future, \u201cwe show that race is at least as strong, and often stronger, than cleavages such as religion, ideology, and class.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pessimistic outlook for the prospect of a return to less divisive politics revealed in many of the papers cited here, and the key role of racial conflict in driving polarization, suggest that the ability of the United States to come to terms with its increasingly multiracial, multiethnic population remains in question. This country has been a full-fledged democracy for less than 60 years \u2014 since passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the changes wrought by three additional revolutions: in civil rights, women\u2019s rights and gay rights. These developments \u2014 or upheavals \u2014 and especially the reaction to them have tested the viability of our democracy and suggest, at the very least, an uphill climb ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Patrick Fitzgerald's Thursday news conference about the Duff financial empire. It was time for lunch; I was hungry and wanted to think this through. There was only one place to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You've just got to go to Gene's,\" said a friend and colleague. She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,\" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. \"You don't know anything, do you?\" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target.

We used to be roommates long ago, and she's finally marrying her partner of 10 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When she told me she was getting married, she did all the usual things that people who are about to be married do. She showed me a picture of her dress, and we talked about the kind of cake they were going to get. In the end, she and her partner decided they'd have a quick wedding in Las Vegas and then do another, more formal ceremony back east in the city where we live. That's this evening, and I'm happy for both of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I used the word \"partner\" in an attempt to be intentionally vague. But I'll tell you now that the bride is a cisgender woman. Her husband is a cisgender man. In short, it's the kind of wedding that conservatives believe is the only kind of wedding that counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's a more complex aspect to their nuptials. She is bisexual and proudly so. It just so happens that she fell in love with a man. She has had many relationships with women. Had she fallen in love with a woman, it's quite possible that the seamstress could have refused to alter her dress, the bakery could have refused to make her a cake. But she avoided all of that by marrying a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Supreme Court has been very busy lately making clear which kinds of people it truly values. By striking down Roe v. Wade, the justices showed us how much they value the opinions of women who want a say in their own health care. By striking down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, they showed us how much they value White over Black and Brown students. By striking down student loan forgiveness, they demonstrated how much they value those who don't have enough money to avoid the Ponzi scheme called student loans. And today they essentially legalized the unequal treatment of LGBTQ people by holding that discrimination is a small price to pay if it lifts up just one kind of love.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Supreme Court has become a conservative dreamland: Out of touch with the country and determined to satisfy conservatives who think they win only when someone else loses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lorie Smith, the Colorado web designer who refuses to make websites for LGBTQ people, may experience a boom in her business. This legal action was the best thing she could have done to make that happen. I don't know if she's a particularly good web designer or not, but I do know she will be lionized in some circles because she helped make people who conservatives don't like suffer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This need by conservatives is not about faith, really. It's about ensuring that Americans they don't know and don't like will suffer. They consider it a win for White people when Black and Brown people suffer. A win for men when women suffer. A win for older, richer people when younger, poorer people suffer. Everything in their minds is binary. We win. You lose. Black and white. And our current Supreme Court has become the favored weapon in their arsenal to bring about heartache for those they don't like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it won't end here. Because whatever lines the justices may think they have carefully drawn during this term, their benefactors in the deep conservative world are just getting warmed up. Get ready for more: More behavior on your part that they will essentially outlaw. More things we're not allowed to teach. More roads for access unceremoniously cut off. More rights trampled on, and more barriers to discrimination lowered. Because the main priority of our conservative Supreme Court is to keep the status quo secure. Solid. And that means keeping certain people down.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, I will go to my friend's wedding in a few hours. And I will smile and have a good time, and I will be happy for her. There will be other LGBTQ friends of hers in attendance, and none of us would dream of sullying her day by reminding her that she's unintentionally made a choice that now, thanks to six people in Washington, places her above us in the American hierarchy of who matters most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was never put in a position to have her right to the pursuit of happiness questioned.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}

I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would \"enforce the law fairly\" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws \"fairly\"? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and \"crack\" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll \"enforce the law.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>) \"limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}

And they never seem to end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would \"dilute decades of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,\" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was \"racial balance,\" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. \"Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,\" explains the Economist magazine, but \"these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,\" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science.

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,\" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,\" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The court operates according to a different rule,\" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. \"There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,\" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. \"He may still be finding things out himself.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's \"median voter,\" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, \"the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 34s "}}

These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered \"white\" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc.

Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as \"case and controversy\" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"The requirement that the proper party \u2014 the party actually affected \u2014 challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. \u2026 Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' \u2014 for settlement of ideological and political disputes.\" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, worst of all, the newfangled \"major questions doctrine\" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of \"major political salience\" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word \"waive\" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. \"[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch \u2014 and the hundreds of millions of people they represent \u2014 in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,\" Kagan wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mumbo-jumbo \"major questions doctrine\" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court \"is supposed to stick to its business \u2014 to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief.\" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the \"major questions doctrine\" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its \"analysis\" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's \"reasoning\" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent \"believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know.\" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that \"38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers. Term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion and ethics reform should be on the table. Simply put, if we want democracy to survive, each election must be a referendum on the court's legitimacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Independence Day, which celebrates rebellion against a monarch lacking consent of the governed, it behooves us to dedicate ourselves to robust and authentic democracy \u2014 government of the people, by the people, for the people \u2014 not by arrogant right-wing justices.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}

But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Stunned, stunned is the word,\" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, \"Gee, I dunno\" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, \"New subject, or else,\" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on \"The Simpsons,\" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just last month,\" Crowley told Geithner, \"AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,\" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"And there's more,\" Crowley said. \"Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly in favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 22s "}}
