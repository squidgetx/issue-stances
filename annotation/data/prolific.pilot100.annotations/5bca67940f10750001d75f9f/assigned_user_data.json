Nettles points it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, says the University of Michigan professor of education, an estimated 89,000 African Americans will be getting baccalaureate degrees this year, continuing a trend that saw an increase of more than 50 percent in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. \"Since 1985, when we were just 8.8 percent of all undergraduates, we've been increasing our presence to the point where we are now over 11 percent,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, he noted, the increases have come in virtually every higher-education sector: in the most highly selective private institutions (up by 57 percent in the 20-year period), in predominately white public universities (up 48 percent), in historically black schools (up 14 percent) and in every region of the country -- with the South leading the pack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nettles, who is executive director of the Frederick D.

Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as \"news.\" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"The groups\" object to Mr. Estrada \"because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,\" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: \"We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas.\" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to \"hold off\" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case. To quote: \"The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted \"to keep the partisanship down.\" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as \"most of Bush's nominees are nazis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave \"pending the outcome of the full investigation.\" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer \"improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports.\" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded?

Two years ago, he was chosen the first Latino Assembly speaker in California history. And Nov. 3, he was elected the first Latino lieutenant governor in 128 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next came Antonio Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat and onetime street kid from East L.A. Last February, he succeeded Bustamante as speaker and, in 2001, may run for L.A. mayor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now comes Rod Pacheco from Riverside, the latest Latino to move up in legislative leadership and into the hierarchy of California politics. He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office. Three more GOP Latinos won Assembly races Nov. 3, quadrupling their seats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all, one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino--24 total, up from 18 last session. There'll be 17 in the Assembly, seven in the Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And for the GOP, Pacheco's rise, plus the three new Latino lawmakers, are among the few bright spots that have emerged from a disastrous election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican party is desperate for credible messengers who can persuade Latino voters they shouldn't keep blaming the GOP for Gov. Pete Wilson's fiery crusades against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and illegal immigration, his doomsday TV ads warning that \"they keep coming.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consequently, there's considerable rooting for Pacheco within the party. The new minority leader still is an unknown--he has been a legislator only two years and nobody knows whether he can lead--but already there's speculation about a future statewide candidacy. For attorney general? Governor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's only 40. He's a former prosecutor who didn't lose a case in 10 years and sent five murderers to death row. He's a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Folks have said stuff like that to me,\" Pacheco says. \"But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor. That's partly their own ambition and partly everybody slapping them on the back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"No. 2, I'm not sure that's my future. I live by the motto, 'Man makes plans and God laughs.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco believes Latinos can be drawn to the Republican party because of common views about safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation and better schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the GOP wants to use him as a party recruiter of Latinos, he's uncomfortable with that. \"I don't think it's my role to carry the banner,\" he says. \"That's up to the party. My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but \"I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans. They're down 48-32 in the Assembly and 25-15 in the Senate, with a Democratic governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he says, \"We need to be assertive. There's the possibility Democrats could be giddy with the elections and think we're irrelevant. But we won't be irrelevant because any bill {requiring a two-thirds vote} will need Republicans. I didn't come here to fight. I could have stayed in the DA's office and fought. But if Democrats don't reach across the aisle, we're probably going to fight more often than not.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrat he'll be fighting with the most is another Latino, Speaker Villaraigosa. And that's a healthy sign for political diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a new era in California politics--more moderate and more Latino. As for Republican Latinos, the GOP can only hope \"they keep coming.\"</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>California and the West; Now Latinos Are Changing the Face of Both Parties</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First there was Cruz Bustamante, a moderate Democrat from Fresno. Two years ago, he was chosen the first Latino Assembly speaker in California history. And Nov. 3, he was elected the first Latino lieutenant governor in 128 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next came Antonio Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat and onetime street kid from East L.A. Last February, he succeeded Bustamante as speaker and, in 2001, may run for L.A. mayor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now comes Rod Pacheco from Riverside, the latest Latino to move up in legislative leadership and into the hierarchy of California politics. He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office. Three more GOP Latinos won Assembly races Nov. 3, quadrupling their seats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all, one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino--24 total, up from 18 last session. There'll be 17 in the Assembly, seven in the Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And for the GOP, Pacheco's rise, plus the three new Latino lawmakers, are among the few bright spots that have emerged from a disastrous election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican party is desperate for credible messengers who can persuade Latino voters they shouldn't keep blaming the GOP for Gov. Pete Wilson's fiery crusades against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and illegal immigration, his doomsday TV ads warning that \"they keep coming.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consequently, there's considerable rooting for Pacheco within the party. The new minority leader still is an unknown--he has been a legislator only two years and nobody knows whether he can lead--but already there's speculation about a future statewide candidacy. For attorney general? Governor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's only 40. He's a former prosecutor who didn't lose a case in 10 years and sent five murderers to death row. He's a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Folks have said stuff like that to me,\" Pacheco says. \"But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor. That's partly their own ambition and partly everybody slapping them on the back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"No. 2, I'm not sure that's my future. I live by the motto, 'Man makes plans and God laughs.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco believes Latinos can be drawn to the Republican party because of common views about safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation and better schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the GOP wants to use him as a party recruiter of Latinos, he's uncomfortable with that. \"I don't think it's my role to carry the banner,\" he says. \"That's up to the party. My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but \"I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans. They're down 48-32 in the Assembly and 25-15 in the Senate, with a Democratic governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he says, \"We need to be assertive. There's the possibility Democrats could be giddy with the elections and think we're irrelevant. But we won't be irrelevant because any bill {requiring a two-thirds vote} will need Republicans. I didn't come here to fight. I could have stayed in the DA's office and fought. But if Democrats don't reach across the aisle, we're probably going to fight more often than not.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrat he'll be fighting with the most is another Latino, Speaker Villaraigosa. And that's a healthy sign for political diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a new era in California politics--more moderate and more Latino.

Brown</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''Racism on Trial: The Chicano Fight for Justice.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With commemorations from coast to coast to remind them, most Americans already know that this week was the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Unfortunately, what they don't realize is that the country missed an equally important anniversary two weeks ago, that of Hernandez v. Texas -- the perennially overshadowed antecedent to Brown that was decided on May 3, 1954.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That case merits commemoration not just because the Supreme Court used it to finally extend constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans, important though that is, especially now that Latinos are the largest minority group. It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Hernandez v.

It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/424890519.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/424890519.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>ABROAD AT HOME; AFTER ANDROPOV</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is going to be a political year now for both the United States and the Soviet Union.

Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked \"colored\" or \"white.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful anti<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> ballot initiative last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, the specter of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed.

West Point now sets a \"class composition goal\" of 7% to 9% African-American cadets every year. The last two incoming classes have been about 7.5% black. These goals are achieved by sending promising young African-Americans to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School for a year to get them up to West Point standards. Overall, 14% of West Point's cadets attended this military prep school, but 37% of its African-Americans did.

That's why even some conservative African-Americans, like Rep. J.C. Watts (R., Okla.), urge caution before dismantling existing programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has navigated this tightrope better than Gen. Powell. In his autobiography, he wrote that \"preferential\" treatment \"demeans\" achievement, but where discrimination has existed \"it is only fair to provide temporary means\" to catch up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week in an interview, Mr. Powell says the issue has nothing do with him but rather with where we are as a society and what works. \"Some of my friends take only the first part of what I wrote and conclude, `see, he's against preferences.' But that was very difficult to write and I nuanced it very carefully. We had a preference system for over 200 years that did not include black people.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is essential now, he says, \"is to get away from the inflammatory stuff that shuts down dialogue.

Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked \"colored\" or \"white.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful anti<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> ballot initiative last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, the specter of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed. If it is seen as opening up, assuring and even fostering equal opportunities, the public is solidly for it.

This time around, the cause of the trouble is not student protests or a war in Vietnam, but <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Again, politics has reared its disruptive head in the realm of education, with consequences as troubling as those surrounding Kerr's ouster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tug-o'-war began last July, when the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring.

After all, Wilson and his Republican predecessors had appointed many of their closest allies to the board and his presidential campaign was in need of a boost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The controversial change in policy sent the nine UC campuses into a frenzy. All nine chancellors opposed the resolution, as did every student government. Activists called for non-compliance, culminating in a huge systemwide walkout on Oct. 12. Most important, the Faculty Senate called for the regents to reverse course, contending that their decision violated the concept of \"shared governance,\" in which regents, UC president, chancellors and faculty strive for consensus before major policy changes are set in motion.

Thus, it wasn't all that surprising when Atkinson announced that he was delaying full implementation of the regents' policy, until fall 1998 for undergraduates, to allow his bureaucracy to come up with suitable alternative guidelines. Like the regents' action in July, politics loomed in the background: While chancellor at UC San Diego, Atkinson was a staunch supporter of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wilson and especially his point man on the Board of Regents, Ward Connerly, contended that, as members of the majority, their policy-making powers were being usurped by the UC president. Atkinson's task, they insisted, was not to interpret their new policy but to enact it, as his job description mandates. Connerly and nine other regents called for a special meeting to review Atkinson's performance--the first such meeting since Kerr's fateful summons in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The threat was obvious and it worked, just as Connerly and Wilson had hoped it would. Atkinson officially apologized for overstepping his bounds and vowed to step up implementation of the new policies by one semester. The meeting was called off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The squabbling among the high brass of the university will no doubt continue until the new socioeconomic guidelines are implemented, if ever.

But Atkinson's decision was no less political. The difference is that the regents have the state Constitution on their side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state of California gives the regents full power to set policy and conduct all business relating to the university.
