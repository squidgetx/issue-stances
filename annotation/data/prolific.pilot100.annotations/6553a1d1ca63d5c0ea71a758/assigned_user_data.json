Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon this will be true of California. And 40 years from now, there will be no majority race in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can look at statistics and know what America will look like in the 21st century.

Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon this will be true of California.

By Jacob Weisberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India,. his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report - once infamous and now widely praised - on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) - among them, E. B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacque-, line Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough .to have been be-. stowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y, the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of \"ah-ah-ahs\" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, \"In ... what dec-ade ... of this century was the ran-dom patient ... with the random ailment ... encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?\" (His answer: \"Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. .. . Penicillin ... was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people.\") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and \"listening.\" In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New Fronierstan Moynihan serving as an adviser in the Kennedy administration, with Vice President Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaving the Left</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Robert Kennedy in 1967, the year he called the liberal left \"rigid and destructive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican Interlude President-elect Nixon announcing the selection of Moynihan as his chief domestic policy adviser.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pragmatic Intellectual</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan in 1981, during his first term as senator</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from New York. He was elected in 1976.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls \"the fisc.\" A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: \"You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport.\" With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. \"When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington,\" he wrote, \"one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO BEgan following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. \"Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him,\" the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and naivete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great .Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: \"the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a \"top administration official\": \"Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the \"roll over him\" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, \"I might just hold health care hostage.\" He went on \"Meet the Press\" to declare: \"We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis.\" Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill \"a fantasy.\" Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. \"I probably was more assertive than was in order,\" he says today, with considerable understatement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could - by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of \"cost disease,\" an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he now think he was wrong about all this? \"I guess I was,\" Moynihan told me. \"You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>if he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general - that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battie that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussign of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed - which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals - radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably - by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. \"I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles,\" he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a \"Meet the Press\" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as \"something I should never have done.\" He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: \"Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?\" IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLINTON WHO APpears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What went wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan \"didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy.\" He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his fathey worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign forgovernor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>upstate Retreat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan at his farm in Pindars Corners, about 70 miles west of Albany. The Irrelevant Senator With President Clinton.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clashes with the new administration put Moynihan on the outside in policy formulation, despite the disdain</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>he shared with Clinton for the traditional left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.AK. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study \"One Third of a Nation,\" which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" a k a the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style - one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a \"matrifocal\" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a \"tangle of pathology.\" One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance \"the stability and resources of the Negro American family\" jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of \"community action,\" which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics,. many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was \"blaming the victim\"; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest - Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson - Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. @km- Wing the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change - at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. \"The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive Continued on Page 68 as any force in American life,\" he wrote in Commentary in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senior Statesman Moynihan walking the halls of Congress with Senator Patrick Leahy last year. After 24 years in the Senate, Moynihan did not seek reelection to a fifth term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER ROBERT Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvardpedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor famfly. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup - presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote \"The Politics of a Guaranteed Income,\" his longest and most serious book, lay.ing. the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. \"The time may have come,\" he noted, \"when the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign neglect.\"' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless - at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunety. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, \"The United States in Opposition.\" The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a \"racist murderer.\" This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more selfcritical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory. EARLY ON, HE EStablished what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to, his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.LA.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, \"Came the Revolution,\" Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that \"something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before.\" In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. \"I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,\" Moynihan said. \"One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years - and the record holder at four years on the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-asyou-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as \"the Mexican ambassador\" (as in, \"don't bother him he's with the Mexican ambassador\").</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, \"Pat.\" Moynihan described himself as having \"almost first-class critical intelligence\" but \"secondclass abilities.\" This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of ED.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,\" says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. \"Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS HE APPROACHES REtirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, \"Miles to Go,\" fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (\"We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!\" Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse - something that can be said for what other senator of his time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,\" says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. \"But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says much the same thing. \"The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,\" he told me. \"The other side really doesn't have anything to say.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old afterhours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has \"lost touch.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Television has emptied the Senate floor,\" Moynihan says. \"That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,\" says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock. That might be taken as a depressing valedictory for a politician who has squandered a vast influence. But what a sad comment, too, about the United States Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jacob Weisberg is chief political correspondent for Slate. He has written for the magazine about Bill Clinton, Robert Rubin and others.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>For the sake of argument</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a great minder of Senate traditions and a stirring elected intellectual, perhaps Washington's last.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he sponsored no major legislation, was not the prophet he thinks he was - and never learned the difference between being right and being effective. By Jacob Weisberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India,. his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report - once infamous and now widely praised - on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) - among them, E. B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacque-, line Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough .to have been be-. stowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y, the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of \"ah-ah-ahs\" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, \"In ... what dec-ade ... of this century was the ran-dom patient ... with the random ailment ... encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?\" (His answer: \"Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. .. . Penicillin ... was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people.\") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and \"listening.\" In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New Fronierstan Moynihan serving as an adviser in the Kennedy administration, with Vice President Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaving the Left</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Robert Kennedy in 1967, the year he called the liberal left \"rigid and destructive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican Interlude President-elect Nixon announcing the selection of Moynihan as his chief domestic policy adviser.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pragmatic Intellectual</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan in 1981, during his first term as senator</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from New York. He was elected in 1976.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls \"the fisc.\" A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: \"You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport.\" With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. \"When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington,\" he wrote, \"one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO BEgan following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. \"Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him,\" the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and naivete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great .Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: \"the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a \"top administration official\": \"Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the \"roll over him\" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, \"I might just hold health care hostage.\" He went on \"Meet the Press\" to declare: \"We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis.\" Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill \"a fantasy.\" Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. \"I probably was more assertive than was in order,\" he says today, with considerable understatement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could - by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of \"cost disease,\" an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he now think he was wrong about all this? \"I guess I was,\" Moynihan told me. \"You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>if he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general - that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battie that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussign of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed - which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals - radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably - by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. \"I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles,\" he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a \"Meet the Press\" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as \"something I should never have done.\" He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: \"Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?\" IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLINTON WHO APpears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What went wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan \"didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy.\" He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his fathey worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign forgovernor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>upstate Retreat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan at his farm in Pindars Corners, about 70 miles west of Albany. The Irrelevant Senator With President Clinton.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clashes with the new administration put Moynihan on the outside in policy formulation, despite the disdain</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>he shared with Clinton for the traditional left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.AK. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study \"One Third of a Nation,\" which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" a k a the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style - one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a \"matrifocal\" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a \"tangle of pathology.\" One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance \"the stability and resources of the Negro American family\" jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of \"community action,\" which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics,. many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was \"blaming the victim\"; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest - Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson - Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. @km- Wing the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change - at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. \"The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive Continued on Page 68 as any force in American life,\" he wrote in Commentary in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senior Statesman Moynihan walking the halls of Congress with Senator Patrick Leahy last year. After 24 years in the Senate, Moynihan did not seek reelection to a fifth term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER ROBERT Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvardpedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor famfly. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup - presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote \"The Politics of a Guaranteed Income,\" his longest and most serious book, lay.ing. the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. \"The time may have come,\" he noted, \"when the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign neglect.\"' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless - at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunety. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, \"The United States in Opposition.\" The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a \"racist murderer.\" This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more selfcritical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory. EARLY ON, HE EStablished what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to, his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.LA.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, \"Came the Revolution,\" Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that \"something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before.\" In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. \"I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,\" Moynihan said. \"One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years - and the record holder at four years on the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-asyou-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as \"the Mexican ambassador\" (as in, \"don't bother him he's with the Mexican ambassador\").</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, \"Pat.\" Moynihan described himself as having \"almost first-class critical intelligence\" but \"secondclass abilities.\" This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of ED.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,\" says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. \"Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS HE APPROACHES REtirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, \"Miles to Go,\" fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (\"We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!\" Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse - something that can be said for what other senator of his time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,\" says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. \"But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says much the same thing. \"The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,\" he told me. \"The other side really doesn't have anything to say.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old afterhours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has \"lost touch.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Television has emptied the Senate floor,\" Moynihan says. \"That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,\" says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock. That might be taken as a depressing valedictory for a politician who has squandered a vast influence. But what a sad comment, too, about the United States Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jacob Weisberg is chief political correspondent for Slate.

Many of the arguments against divestment as a general tactic are by now well known. They include practical ones, such as the difficulty of divesting fully when portfolios contain index funds, hedge funds and other complex instruments; concerns about adverse effects on the ability of endowments to support education and research as fully as they could if they were unconstrained; and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about changes (which are often unspecified) in corporate practice. In general, I find these objections persuasive, though they need to be tested and debated in each situation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One argument in favor of divestment that I find entirely unpersuasive is the claim that a university is obligated to take a stand on any issue of broad social import that individuals - including, not infrequently, the president of a university acting in citizen mode! - regard as highly consequential. This is nonsense. To abstain is both a legitimate and appropriate action when the issue is not central to an institution's educational mission. Universities need to keep control over their agendas and decide for themselves when it is appropriate to take a position. An issue such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> - which directly affects educational processes and outcomes - has a very different claim on academia than does the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taking an institutional stand on political issues of many kinds threatens the primary educational mission of the university, which is to be avowedly open to arguments of every kind and to avoid giving priority to partisan or other political viewpoints. The university should be the home of the critic - indeed, the home of critics of many different persuasions - not the critic itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But my main quarrel with current debates over divestment is that they pay too little attention, if any attention at all, to what I regard as the insidious moral perils of divestment. There is, first of all, the sometime hypocrisy of seeking institutional \"purity\" while failing individually to reduce consumption of fossil fuels or, for a faculty member, to divest one's personal stake in investment vehicles, including index funds, that contain questionable holdings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, with regard to endowments, there is the question of an institution's obligation, seen as a matter of trust, to honor the intent of donors - many of whom surely gave money to endow specific activities, such as scholarships, believing that the institution would seek to earn as large a return as it prudently could.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, there is the very real danger that, as Macalester College President Brian Rosenberg has explained so well, joining the crowd in pushing for an institutional position on issues such as fossil fuels is too easy; it can tempt individuals to substitute such \"easy\" actions for their responsibility to act as citizens in pursuing more difficult courses of action, including working tirelessly in the political process. Of course, one can do both, but one wonders how often that happens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, these are times when educational institutions need to work harder, in my view, to improve educational outcomes, especially for less-privileged students. A related obligation is to seek new ways of controlling educational costs to address affordability issues that will not be solved, I suspect, by increased governmental support. At the institutional level, there are only so many dollars to spend, and only so many hours in the day to work on issues of consequence. Well- intentioned but poorly conceived efforts to compel colleges and universities to fight extramural battles of all kinds can impair efforts to work harder on issues of great social as well as educational consequence that are at the core of the basic educational mission of higher education. Such trade-offs receive too little - and sometimes no - consideration. And there is a slippery slope to be considered - divesting for one purpose can make it harder for the institution to resist other calls to use divestment as a political tactic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Searching for answers to the question of how to make one's greatest contribution to the common good is anything but easy, for institutions or for individuals.
