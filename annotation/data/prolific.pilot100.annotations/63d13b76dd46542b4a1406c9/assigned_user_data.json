This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination.

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class.

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class.

In this article, we discuss a different type of partisan polarization underappreciated by scholars: \u201cbelief polarization,\u201d or disagreements over what people perceive to be true.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of belief polarization has been defined in a number of ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their May 2021 paper, \u201cBelief polarization in a complex world,\u201d Alan Jern, Kai-min Kevin Chang and Charles Kemp \u2014 of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Melbourne \u2014 write: \u201cBelief polarization occurs when two people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, they continue, \u201cample evidence that people sustain different beliefs even when faced with the same information, and they interpret that information differently.\u201d They also note that \u201cstark differences in beliefs can arise and endure due to human limitations in interpreting complex information.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kristoffer Nimark, an economist at Cornell, and Savitar Sundaresan, of Imperial College London, describe belief polarization this way: \u201cThe beliefs of ex ante identical agents over time can cluster in two distinct groups at opposite ends of the belief space.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scott F. Aikin and Robert B. Talisse, professors of philosophy at Vanderbilt, argue in their 2019 paper \u2014 \u201cHow Does Belief Polarization Work\u201d \u2014 that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of what makes belief polarization so disconcerting is its ubiquity. It has been extensively studied for more than 50 years and found to be operative within groups of all kinds, formal and informal. Furthermore, belief polarization does not discriminate between different kinds of belief. Like-minded groups polarize regardless of whether they are discussing banal matters of fact, matters of personal taste, or questions about value. What\u2019s more, the phenomenon operates regardless of the explicit point of the group\u2019s discussion. Like-minded groups polarize when they are trying to decide an action that the group will take; and they polarize also when there is no specific decision to be reached. Finally, the phenomenon is prevalent regardless of group members\u2019 nationality, race, gender, religion, economic status, and level of education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talisse, writing separately, observes that:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The social environment itself can trigger extremity shifts. These prompts need not be verbal, explicit, or literal; they can be merely implicit signals to group members that some belief is prevalent among them \u2014 hats, pins, campaign signs, logos, and gestures are all potential initiators of belief polarization. Further, as corroboration is really a matter of numbers, those with the power to present the appearance of widespread acceptance among a particular social group of some idea thereby have the power to induce extremity shifts among those who identify with that group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most salient recent illustration of belief polarization is the diametrically opposed view of Trump loyalists and of their Democratic adversaries over the legitimacy of the 2020 election: Trump supporters are convinced it was stolen; Democrats and independents are certain that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, politicians on the right \u2014 and Fox News \u2014 are treating the F.B.I. raid on Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago on Monday as a corrupt politicization of federal investigative authority while liberals \u2014 and CNN \u2014 counter that the raid demonstrates that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay and her colleagues expand the scope of belief polarization to look at the differences between Republicans and Democrats over the causes of inequality:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We illustrate large, and increasing, partisan divides in beliefs regarding whether an unequal society, or unequal behavior, is the cause of socioeconomic inequality. Republican politicians and citizens are optimistic about the American dream and pessimistic about poor people\u2019s behavior; Democratic politicians and citizens are pessimistic about the Dream and optimistic about poor people\u2019s ability to succeed if given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These patterns, Suhay and her collaborators continue,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>hold for beliefs about economic inequality along both class and race lines. Variation in societal versus individual blame is consistently associated with views on social welfare, taxation, and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. We conclude that Americans\u2019 beliefs about the fairness of the economy represent a crucial component of a redistributive versus anti-redistributive ideology that is increasingly associated with the two political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay writes that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic Party has long justified its left-leaning economic policies with two central claims: significant economic inequality exists between individuals and social groups, and these great inequalities are unfair because society, not individuals, are to blame for them. The latter proposition is especially important. It is difficult to deny that many harsh inequalities exist in the United States. Exorbitant wealth as well as homelessness are plain to see. However, such inequalities might be tolerated if they are viewed as the outcome of a meritocratic system.

Belief polarization is a reality that is not easily overcome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One theme that emerges repeatedly in looking at belief polarization is the role race plays as a central factor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter K. Enns and Ashley Jardina, political scientists at Cornell and Duke, make the case in their October 2021 paper, \u201cComplicating the role of White racial attitudes and anti-immigrant sentiment in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u201d that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the research on the relationship between white racial attitudes and Trump support is part of a tradition that assumes that racial attitudes are fairly stable predispositions that form early in life and then later become important for political reasoning. Implied in this line of research is that politicians or political campaigns do not change levels of prejudice, but they can prime these attitudes, or make them more or less salient and therefore more or less politically relevant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enns and Jardina write that, in contrast to this view, over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign \u201cmany whites shifted their survey responses on questions related to race and immigration to align with their support for Trump or Clinton.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To test their argument, the authors used \u201ca unique panel data set from surveys conducted by YouGov of more than 5,000 respondents interviewed at multiple points during the 2016 presidential election campaign.\u201d From that study, they found that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong link between white attitudes toward Black Americans and Trump support observed in prior studies is likely due as much to white Trump supporters updating their survey responses to report opinions more consistent with Trump\u2019s, as it is to Trump drawing support from more racially antagonistic white voters. Similar results emerge with respect to whites\u2019 immigration opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They found, for example, that from January 2016 to August 2016, the percentage of Trump supporters voicing strong opposition to Black Lives Matter grew by roughly 15 percentage points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Enns contended that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>regardless of the precise underlying mechanisms (and multiple mechanisms could be at work), the evidence suggests that Trump\u2019s rhetoric had a meaningful effect on the views his supporters expressed about these issues. We are definitely arguing that the attitudes individuals express can be changed by what candidates they support say and do. Although we cannot observe actual beliefs, to the extent that expressing previously unexpressed beliefs has a reinforcing effect, that would also provide evidence of a deepening or potential changing of racial attitudes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong association between Trump support and whites\u2019 views on racial issues, Enns and Jardina argue in their paper,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>was not merely a result of Trump attracting racist whites by way of his own racist rhetoric or a reflection of partisan racial sorting that had already occurred; it was also a result of white Trump supporters changing their views to be more in line with Trump\u2019s over the course of his presidential campaign. In other words, Trump not only attracted whites with more conservative views on race; he also made his white supporters more likely to espouse increasingly extreme views on issues related to immigration and on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement and police killings of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew M. Engelhardt, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina\u2014Greensboro, developed a similar line of analysis in his January 2020 paper, \u201cRacial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Engelhardt wrote:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the reason White Democrats and White Republicans hold increasingly different views about Black Americans is due to their partisanship. It\u2019s not just that Democrats with negative views became Republicans, or Republicans with more positive views became Democrats. Rather, people are changing their attitudes, and part of this, I argue, is due to how politicians talk about Black Americans. Republicans, for instance, could have internalized Trump\u2019s negative rhetoric, and increasingly held more negative views. Democrats, similarly, hear Trump say these negative things and they move opposite, holding more positive views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his paper, Engelhardt wrote that undergirding past studies of the role of race in politics and policymaking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>is an assumption that racial animus feeds political conflict. I turn this conventional wisdom on its head by arguing that political conflict can shape racial attitudes \u2014 people\u2019s views and beliefs about groups understood to be racial. Political scientists have failed to examine this possibility, perhaps because racial attitudes are seen as persistent and influential predispositions that form during childhood, long before most Americans become political animals. According to this line of reasoning, individuals use these early formed attitudes to make sense of politics; racial attitudes lead to partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ever-growing divide between left and right extends well beyond racial issues and attitudes. In his email, Engelhardt wrote that his results are \u201csuggestive of partisanship motivating changes in other orientations which we might presumably see as more stable and core to individuals.\u201d He cited research showing that \u201cpartisanship influences religiosity and religious affiliation\u201d and other studies linking \u201cpolitical concerns to changes in racial self-identification.\u201d Engelhardt added that he has \u201csome unpublished results where I find partisanship leads Democrats to hold more positive views of gay men and lesbians, transgender individuals, and feminists, over time, with Republicans holding more negative views of these groups in the same period (data range 2016-2020).\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their January 2022 paper, \u201cThe Origins and Consequences of Racialized Schemas about U.S. Parties,\u201d Kirill Zhirkov and Nicholas Valentino, political scientists at the Universities of Virginia and Michigan, make an interesting argument, that, in effect, \u201cTwo parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zhirkov and Valentino continue:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in the 1970s, Democratic candidates in presidential elections started to attract large/ shares of nonwhite voters whereas Republicans increasingly relied on votes of racially conservative whites. Over the same period, voters\u2019 positions on seemingly nonracial political issues have gradually become more intertwined with racial resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the two scholars write,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the growing racial gap between the Democratic and Republican support bases leads to formation of racialized stereotypes about the two parties. Specifically, a non-trivial share of American electorate currently views the Democratic Party as nonwhite and the Republican Party as white, though in reality whites continue to be a majority of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This \u201cimagined racial coalition of each party,\u201d in the view of Zhirkov and Valentino,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>carries profound implications for the ongoing discussion in the discipline about affective polarization in American politics: whites feel colder toward the Democratic Party when they imagine its coalition to be more heavily made up on nonwhites and feel warmer toward the Republican Party when they perceive it to be dominated by their racial group. As a consequence, rather than a cause, they may then come to accept a more conservative issue package advocated by the modern Republican Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racial attitudes, the authors argue persuasively, \u201care now important predictors of opinions about electoral fairness, gun control, policing, international trade and health care.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, Zhirkov and Valentino note, long-range implications for the future of democracy here:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon as ethnic parties start to compete for political power, winning \u2014 rather than implementing a certain policy \u2014 becomes the goal in and of itself due to associated boost in group status and self-esteem of its members. Moreover, comparative evidence suggests that U.S. plurality-based electoral system contributes to politicization of ethnic cleavages rather than mitigates them. Therefore, the racialization of American parties is likely to continue, and the intensity of political conflict in the United States is likely to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked the authors how they would characterize the importance of race in contemporary American politics. In a jointly written email, they replied that in research to be published in the future, \u201cwe show that race is at least as strong, and often stronger, than cleavages such as religion, ideology, and class.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pessimistic outlook for the prospect of a return to less divisive politics revealed in many of the papers cited here, and the key role of racial conflict in driving polarization, suggest that the ability of the United States to come to terms with its increasingly multiracial, multiethnic population remains in question. This country has been a full-fledged democracy for less than 60 years \u2014 since passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the changes wrought by three additional revolutions: in civil rights, women\u2019s rights and gay rights. These developments \u2014 or upheavals \u2014 and especially the reaction to them have tested the viability of our democracy and suggest, at the very least, an uphill climb ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In this article, we discuss a different type of partisan polarization underappreciated by scholars: \u201cbelief polarization,\u201d or disagreements over what people perceive to be true.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of belief polarization has been defined in a number of ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their May 2021 paper, \u201cBelief polarization in a complex world,\u201d Alan Jern, Kai-min Kevin Chang and Charles Kemp \u2014 of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Melbourne \u2014 write: \u201cBelief polarization occurs when two people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, they continue, \u201cample evidence that people sustain different beliefs even when faced with the same information, and they interpret that information differently.\u201d They also note that \u201cstark differences in beliefs can arise and endure due to human limitations in interpreting complex information.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kristoffer Nimark, an economist at Cornell, and Savitar Sundaresan, of Imperial College London, describe belief polarization this way: \u201cThe beliefs of ex ante identical agents over time can cluster in two distinct groups at opposite ends of the belief space.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scott F. Aikin and Robert B. Talisse, professors of philosophy at Vanderbilt, argue in their 2019 paper \u2014 \u201cHow Does Belief Polarization Work\u201d \u2014 that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of what makes belief polarization so disconcerting is its ubiquity. It has been extensively studied for more than 50 years and found to be operative within groups of all kinds, formal and informal. Furthermore, belief polarization does not discriminate between different kinds of belief. Like-minded groups polarize regardless of whether they are discussing banal matters of fact, matters of personal taste, or questions about value. What\u2019s more, the phenomenon operates regardless of the explicit point of the group\u2019s discussion. Like-minded groups polarize when they are trying to decide an action that the group will take; and they polarize also when there is no specific decision to be reached. Finally, the phenomenon is prevalent regardless of group members\u2019 nationality, race, gender, religion, economic status, and level of education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talisse, writing separately, observes that:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The social environment itself can trigger extremity shifts. These prompts need not be verbal, explicit, or literal; they can be merely implicit signals to group members that some belief is prevalent among them \u2014 hats, pins, campaign signs, logos, and gestures are all potential initiators of belief polarization. Further, as corroboration is really a matter of numbers, those with the power to present the appearance of widespread acceptance among a particular social group of some idea thereby have the power to induce extremity shifts among those who identify with that group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most salient recent illustration of belief polarization is the diametrically opposed view of Trump loyalists and of their Democratic adversaries over the legitimacy of the 2020 election: Trump supporters are convinced it was stolen; Democrats and independents are certain that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, politicians on the right \u2014 and Fox News \u2014 are treating the F.B.I. raid on Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago on Monday as a corrupt politicization of federal investigative authority while liberals \u2014 and CNN \u2014 counter that the raid demonstrates that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay and her colleagues expand the scope of belief polarization to look at the differences between Republicans and Democrats over the causes of inequality:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We illustrate large, and increasing, partisan divides in beliefs regarding whether an unequal society, or unequal behavior, is the cause of socioeconomic inequality. Republican politicians and citizens are optimistic about the American dream and pessimistic about poor people\u2019s behavior; Democratic politicians and citizens are pessimistic about the Dream and optimistic about poor people\u2019s ability to succeed if given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These patterns, Suhay and her collaborators continue,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>hold for beliefs about economic inequality along both class and race lines. Variation in societal versus individual blame is consistently associated with views on social welfare, taxation, and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. We conclude that Americans\u2019 beliefs about the fairness of the economy represent a crucial component of a redistributive versus anti-redistributive ideology that is increasingly associated with the two political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay writes that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic Party has long justified its left-leaning economic policies with two central claims: significant economic inequality exists between individuals and social groups, and these great inequalities are unfair because society, not individuals, are to blame for them. The latter proposition is especially important. It is difficult to deny that many harsh inequalities exist in the United States. Exorbitant wealth as well as homelessness are plain to see. However, such inequalities might be tolerated if they are viewed as the outcome of a meritocratic system. Democrats argue instead that \u201cthe American dream\u201d \u2014 success via hard work \u2014 is not a reality for many. Thus, low-income people deserve government assistance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, Suhay continues, Republicans emphasize</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>aggregate economic growth and downplay the extent of inequality.

Implied in this line of research is that politicians or political campaigns do not change levels of prejudice, but they can prime these attitudes, or make them more or less salient and therefore more or less politically relevant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enns and Jardina write that, in contrast to this view, over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign \u201cmany whites shifted their survey responses on questions related to race and immigration to align with their support for Trump or Clinton.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To test their argument, the authors used \u201ca unique panel data set from surveys conducted by YouGov of more than 5,000 respondents interviewed at multiple points during the 2016 presidential election campaign.\u201d From that study, they found that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong link between white attitudes toward Black Americans and Trump support observed in prior studies is likely due as much to white Trump supporters updating their survey responses to report opinions more consistent with Trump\u2019s, as it is to Trump drawing support from more racially antagonistic white voters. Similar results emerge with respect to whites\u2019 immigration opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They found, for example, that from January 2016 to August 2016, the percentage of Trump supporters voicing strong opposition to Black Lives Matter grew by roughly 15 percentage points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Enns contended that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>regardless of the precise underlying mechanisms (and multiple mechanisms could be at work), the evidence suggests that Trump\u2019s rhetoric had a meaningful effect on the views his supporters expressed about these issues. We are definitely arguing that the attitudes individuals express can be changed by what candidates they support say and do. Although we cannot observe actual beliefs, to the extent that expressing previously unexpressed beliefs has a reinforcing effect, that would also provide evidence of a deepening or potential changing of racial attitudes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong association between Trump support and whites\u2019 views on racial issues, Enns and Jardina argue in their paper,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>was not merely a result of Trump attracting racist whites by way of his own racist rhetoric or a reflection of partisan racial sorting that had already occurred; it was also a result of white Trump supporters changing their views to be more in line with Trump\u2019s over the course of his presidential campaign. In other words, Trump not only attracted whites with more conservative views on race; he also made his white supporters more likely to espouse increasingly extreme views on issues related to immigration and on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement and police killings of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew M. Engelhardt, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina\u2014Greensboro, developed a similar line of analysis in his January 2020 paper, \u201cRacial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Engelhardt wrote:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the reason White Democrats and White Republicans hold increasingly different views about Black Americans is due to their partisanship. It\u2019s not just that Democrats with negative views became Republicans, or Republicans with more positive views became Democrats. Rather, people are changing their attitudes, and part of this, I argue, is due to how politicians talk about Black Americans. Republicans, for instance, could have internalized Trump\u2019s negative rhetoric, and increasingly held more negative views. Democrats, similarly, hear Trump say these negative things and they move opposite, holding more positive views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his paper, Engelhardt wrote that undergirding past studies of the role of race in politics and policymaking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>is an assumption that racial animus feeds political conflict. I turn this conventional wisdom on its head by arguing that political conflict can shape racial attitudes \u2014 people\u2019s views and beliefs about groups understood to be racial. Political scientists have failed to examine this possibility, perhaps because racial attitudes are seen as persistent and influential predispositions that form during childhood, long before most Americans become political animals. According to this line of reasoning, individuals use these early formed attitudes to make sense of politics; racial attitudes lead to partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ever-growing divide between left and right extends well beyond racial issues and attitudes. In his email, Engelhardt wrote that his results are \u201csuggestive of partisanship motivating changes in other orientations which we might presumably see as more stable and core to individuals.\u201d He cited research showing that \u201cpartisanship influences religiosity and religious affiliation\u201d and other studies linking \u201cpolitical concerns to changes in racial self-identification.\u201d Engelhardt added that he has \u201csome unpublished results where I find partisanship leads Democrats to hold more positive views of gay men and lesbians, transgender individuals, and feminists, over time, with Republicans holding more negative views of these groups in the same period (data range 2016-2020).\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their January 2022 paper, \u201cThe Origins and Consequences of Racialized Schemas about U.S. Parties,\u201d Kirill Zhirkov and Nicholas Valentino, political scientists at the Universities of Virginia and Michigan, make an interesting argument, that, in effect, \u201cTwo parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zhirkov and Valentino continue:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in the 1970s, Democratic candidates in presidential elections started to attract large/ shares of nonwhite voters whereas Republicans increasingly relied on votes of racially conservative whites. Over the same period, voters\u2019 positions on seemingly nonracial political issues have gradually become more intertwined with racial resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the two scholars write,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the growing racial gap between the Democratic and Republican support bases leads to formation of racialized stereotypes about the two parties. Specifically, a non-trivial share of American electorate currently views the Democratic Party as nonwhite and the Republican Party as white, though in reality whites continue to be a majority of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This \u201cimagined racial coalition of each party,\u201d in the view of Zhirkov and Valentino,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>carries profound implications for the ongoing discussion in the discipline about affective polarization in American politics: whites feel colder toward the Democratic Party when they imagine its coalition to be more heavily made up on nonwhites and feel warmer toward the Republican Party when they perceive it to be dominated by their racial group. As a consequence, rather than a cause, they may then come to accept a more conservative issue package advocated by the modern Republican Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racial attitudes, the authors argue persuasively, \u201care now important predictors of opinions about electoral fairness, gun control, policing, international trade and health care.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, Zhirkov and Valentino note, long-range implications for the future of democracy here:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon as ethnic parties start to compete for political power, winning \u2014 rather than implementing a certain policy \u2014 becomes the goal in and of itself due to associated boost in group status and self-esteem of its members. Moreover, comparative evidence suggests that U.S. plurality-based electoral system contributes to politicization of ethnic cleavages rather than mitigates them. Therefore, the racialization of American parties is likely to continue, and the intensity of political conflict in the United States is likely to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked the authors how they would characterize the importance of race in contemporary American politics. In a jointly written email, they replied that in research to be published in the future, \u201cwe show that race is at least as strong, and often stronger, than cleavages such as religion, ideology, and class.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pessimistic outlook for the prospect of a return to less divisive politics revealed in many of the papers cited here, and the key role of racial conflict in driving polarization, suggest that the ability of the United States to come to terms with its increasingly multiracial, multiethnic population remains in question. This country has been a full-fledged democracy for less than 60 years \u2014 since passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the changes wrought by three additional revolutions: in civil rights, women\u2019s rights and gay rights. These developments \u2014 or upheavals \u2014 and especially the reaction to them have tested the viability of our democracy and suggest, at the very least, an uphill climb ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
