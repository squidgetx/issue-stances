And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis.

I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R.

I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did. For me (and probably a lot of suburbanites voting this fall), this is more than a backdrop to his presidency. It's a dealbreaker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their zeal to beat back Trumpism, the loudest Democratic groups have transformed into its Bizarro World imitators. Tossing aside ideals of equal opportunity and free expression, the new leftists obsess on identity as much as their adversaries do \u2014 but instead of trying to restore some obsolete notion of a White-dominated society, they seek vengeance under the guise of virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the bibles of this movement is a book called \"How to Be an Antiracist,\" in which Ibram X.

Johnson-style <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which still makes sense to me. It is a case for the kind of social upheaval that occurred when foreign empires relinquished their colonies. It does not end well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals used to believe in civil debate about such ideas. But now, the arbiters of language are constantly issuing Soviet-style edicts about which terms are acceptable and which aren't (\"woke\" was okay, now it's not) \u2014 a tactic used for controlling the debate and delegitimizing critics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can disagree about whether this radical uprising is necessary or politically self-destructive. But it's clearly not in keeping with the principles that are supposed to unite the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was taught \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that in the United States, we are bound not by common origin, language or culture but by a series of laws and values that make us who we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as you swear allegiance to those laws and values \u2014 racial equality, free speech, unfettered worship \u2014 then you're no more or less American than anyone else, and no less deserving of respect, protection and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That we've failed to honor that promise over the life of the country, and are failing still, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and abandon the project. It means you rededicate yourself to the ideal of true equality, rather than reducing individuals to a box on a census form.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the ideology that both parties used to call liberalism. There is no longer room for it in today's stark political dichotomy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, it's a testimony to the damage that one shameless and unprincipled man managed to wreak on our politics. Trump always had a talent for bringing out the worst in everyone; more than a year after leaving office, he remains the decaying star by which everyone else in our political solar system must orient themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also the result of an antiquated primary system \u2014 at the presidential level and below \u2014 that plays to an ever-winnowing group of fervent believers in both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more people grow disgusted with extremist party politics, the more only those extremists are heard and the more power they exert on anyone who wants to run for higher office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is about the point where some (most likely some in my own business) will scream: \"Both sidesism!\" That's the now-cliche argument that any criticism of Democrats whatsoever must be some kind of journalistic reflex to equate the parties, when clearly one is worse than the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is worse than the other. But that doesn't mean we have to feel jazzed about supporting a party that would grade our worthiness as people on a sliding scale of identity. It doesn't change the fact that the broad center of the American electorate \u2014 traditional conservatives and liberals both \u2014 no longer has a political home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where do we go?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, I've predicted the eventual triumph of an independent president, outside the two-party system.

And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job \u2014 a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich \u2014 who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote \u2014 that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did. For me (and probably a lot of suburbanites voting this fall), this is more than a backdrop to his presidency. It's a dealbreaker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their zeal to beat back Trumpism, the loudest Democratic groups have transformed into its Bizarro World imitators. Tossing aside ideals of equal opportunity and free expression, the new leftists obsess on identity as much as their adversaries do \u2014 but instead of trying to restore some obsolete notion of a White-dominated society, they seek vengeance under the guise of virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the bibles of this movement is a book called \"How to Be an Antiracist,\" in which Ibram X. Kendi declares: \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not \u2014 as the celebrated author claims \u2014 an expression of support for Lyndon B. Johnson-style <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which still makes sense to me. It is a case for the kind of social upheaval that occurred when foreign empires relinquished their colonies. It does not end well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals used to believe in civil debate about such ideas. But now, the arbiters of language are constantly issuing Soviet-style edicts about which terms are acceptable and which aren't (\"woke\" was okay, now it's not) \u2014 a tactic used for controlling the debate and delegitimizing critics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can disagree about whether this radical uprising is necessary or politically self-destructive. But it's clearly not in keeping with the principles that are supposed to unite the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was taught \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that in the United States, we are bound not by common origin, language or culture but by a series of laws and values that make us who we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as you swear allegiance to those laws and values \u2014 racial equality, free speech, unfettered worship \u2014 then you're no more or less American than anyone else, and no less deserving of respect, protection and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That we've failed to honor that promise over the life of the country, and are failing still, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and abandon the project. It means you rededicate yourself to the ideal of true equality, rather than reducing individuals to a box on a census form.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the ideology that both parties used to call liberalism. There is no longer room for it in today's stark political dichotomy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, it's a testimony to the damage that one shameless and unprincipled man managed to wreak on our politics. Trump always had a talent for bringing out the worst in everyone; more than a year after leaving office, he remains the decaying star by which everyone else in our political solar system must orient themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also the result of an antiquated primary system \u2014 at the presidential level and below \u2014 that plays to an ever-winnowing group of fervent believers in both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more people grow disgusted with extremist party politics, the more only those extremists are heard and the more power they exert on anyone who wants to run for higher office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is about the point where some (most likely some in my own business) will scream: \"Both sidesism!\" That's the now-cliche argument that any criticism of Democrats whatsoever must be some kind of journalistic reflex to equate the parties, when clearly one is worse than the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is worse than the other. But that doesn't mean we have to feel jazzed about supporting a party that would grade our worthiness as people on a sliding scale of identity. It doesn't change the fact that the broad center of the American electorate \u2014 traditional conservatives and liberals both \u2014 no longer has a political home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where do we go?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, I've predicted the eventual triumph of an independent president, outside the two-party system. That candidate hasn't emerged, but the lane for a credible independent has never been wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's also the probability that some reformist Democratic governor or political novice is looking at the political landscape and thinking that, if you could unify that liberal constituency inside the party, you might just be able to commandeer it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've never been very good at predicting the path ahead. What I do know is that politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum \u2014 and, one way or another, a force will arise to fill the space at the eye of our destructive political storm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until then, you can call me a dissenter.</p></div>"}, "test_question_testing_1": {"id": "test_question_testing_1", "text": "<p>Trump\u2019s megaphone amplifies white nationalism</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the realm of political discourse, President Trump wields a megaphone that seemingly amplifies the disquieting strains of white nationalism.

The group even has a quasi-governmental function: It certifies lawyers and law schools, and regulates their conduct. The ABA also formally advises the President and Senate on judicial nominations.

But for most of the past 25 years, precious little of that optimism was evident when they looked toward their country's future. With only brief exceptions since the early 1970s, a majority of Americans--often an overwhelming majority--told pollsters they believed the country was on the wrong track.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, in its attitude toward the future, America is beginning to resemble the country it was through the early 1960s. Though some surveys still produce more ambivalent responses, most polls now show that a plurality of Americans believe the country is moving in the right direction. Consumer confidence is at a 28-year high. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of all Americans described themselves as \"highly contented\" with their lives--by far the highest figure recorded in the past 30 years. Even President Clinton is enjoying his rosiest approval ratings ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have not surrendered their pessimism lightly. But it has been beaten down by a pitiless procession of good news. The economy, now in its sixth year of growth, has driven down unemployment to its lowest level in a quarter century. The federal budget deficit, which once threatened to submerge Washington, is evaporating like a puddle on a sunny day. Crime is way down, and the rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth are stabilizing after years of explosive growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The return of American optimism, though, is arguably rooted in something more fundamental than any of this. After more than a decade of doubt, America once again considers itself the capital of the future. During the 1980s, many Americans glumly concluded that the 21st century would be forged in places like Tokyo and Taipei. Now, Americans see the future being shaped in Seattle (home of Microsoft, the emblematic company of the Information Age), Hollywood (which sets the beat for global culture) and Silicon Valley (the Finland Station for the computer and Internet revolutions). \"Is this a great time, or what?\" asks MCI in a revealing ad campaign that would have been laughed off the air not long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Very few politicians have considered the implications of governing a society in which optimism about the future is again the default position. But if it lasts, this rebirth of American confidence could change politics in ways both subtle and profound.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, both the left and the right have framed much of their agenda around constructing a convincing explanation for the anxiety that gnawed at many Americans. Conservatives pointed their fingers at big government, welfare, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, immigrants and the forces of cultural change; liberals targeted the rich, the global economy and big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this more optimistic environment, though, those demons are losing their horns. \"There is just less hostility out there,\" says Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. \"It is a lot easier to get people agitated when things aren't going well.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some respects, the politics of international trade remains the great exception to this pattern. Yet even the House rebellion against fast-track trade authority in November marked a subtle shift in attitudes. Ten years ago, trade anxieties focused on the fear that the U.S. could not compete with Japan in the most technologically advanced sectors. Today, trade anxieties are almost completely limited to the fear that the U.S. will lose low-skill jobs to low-wage countries such as Mexico. That's not a trivial concern, but it's a long way from the fear of national economic decline that haunted the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The continued skirmishing over trade doesn't obscure the power of Hart's observation. In good times, it's difficult to mobilize the public behind ideological crusades. In these circumstances, voters prefer incrementalism, not sudden change; rather than polarization, they look for convergence. (Clinton has understood this far better than those Republicans still clamoring for more confrontation.) These days, the dominant message from Americans to their capital seems to be: Get along, compromise and stay out of our way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That message can be very much of a mixed blessing. Indeed, the same can be said about the overall brightening of American attitudes. The good news is that the improved public mood encourages both parties to pursue reasonable compromises on the issues dividing them--as they did to balance the budget last summer. But the risk is that the good feelings can easily slide into triumphalism and complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, for all the positive trends, America still faces serious problems: too many lackluster schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, the impending cost of retiring the baby boom, inner cities where both opportunity and fathers are scarce. History suggests the good times are precisely the moment to tackle such difficult challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the prosperity from the end of World War II to the 1973 oil shock, the GI generation laid the foundation for growth: building the interstate highway system and great public universities, subsidizing the development of the semiconductor and the Internet. At the same time, the nation enlarged the circle of opportunity by ending segregation and filled in the social safety net by guaranteeing health care for the elderly and poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That record offers the standard against which history is likely to judge today's leaders. At the moment, Clinton and his Republican rivals appear content to mostly preside over this era of good feelings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the precedent of America's long postwar boom offers a more productive alternative: investing prosperity to sustain prosperity and share its benefits more widely. The lack of public demand for a more ambitious agenda doesn't obviate the need for one. Pessimism is a corrosive force in a nation's life.

More than 90 percent of Black women have cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections. In 2008 and 2012 they had the highest turnout rate among all racial, ethnic and gender groups. No other major demographic is as loyal to either party as Black people. And Black women have become increasingly organized and focused on making that support meaningful for themselves and their community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That kind of turnout and loyalty doesn\u2019t just happen. Largely without any major investment from the Democratic Party, Black women have worked through grass-roots organizations to register new voters and motivate them to cast ballots. The work of groups like the New Georgia Project to transform the electoral landscape of the South has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new voters. In Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017. Across the country, Black congresswomen like Lucy McBath of Georgia, Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts have run for office and won historic victories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black women have also formed organizations to support and encourage more Black women to run for office and maximize their political power. Glynda Carr\u2019s Higher Heights for America, Aimee Allison\u2019s She The People and Leah Daughtry\u2019s Power Rising are examples of organizations that convene discussions with African-American women, empower those who want to run for office and insist that candidates answer questions that are important to Black women. During the Democratic primaries, nearly every candidate showed up to discuss his or her views about race and gender at a forum held by She The People in April. They understood that their road to the White House is paved not just by Black women\u2019s votes but also by their labor as volunteers, community influencers and, increasingly, important donors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, this moment is decades in the making. A century ago this month, women demanded and earned the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment. In that effort, African-American women were often asked to march behind white women and participate in segregated rallies. Most Black women didn\u2019t get access to the ballot until the Voting Rights Act was passed 45 years later. African-American women understood the power of the vote to choose candidates who would enact policies that either helped or hindered their quest for equal rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation\u2019s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups.
