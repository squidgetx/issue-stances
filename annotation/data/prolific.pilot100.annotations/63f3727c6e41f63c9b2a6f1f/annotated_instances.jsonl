He will have to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pinata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}

Gray Davis cleaned up last year railing about California's sorry schools. Pete Wilson left the governor's office on a high note after morphing into an education reformer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some time, education has been the winning issue for California politicians. Candidates who ignored it--like Dan Lungren last year--were themselves ignored by voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now at least one pollster believes that the issue has peaked and soon will hit the skids as the voters' top concern. \"Health care is charging to the top,\" asserts Steve Kinney of Hermosa Beach, a GOP operative and pollster for 30 years. However, \"infrastructure is the fastest growing issue,\" he adds, and probably will be No. 1 by the 2002 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's assuming the economy keeps booming. If not, Kinney foresees voters fretting more about taxes, crime and jobs--as they did earlier in the decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's theory about education as a voter motivator is that the politicians--especially Davis--will talk themselves out of a good issue, like animals overgrazing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Legislature passes the governor's modest reform proposals, the feds kick in more education money and all the pols beat their chests about how they're fixing the schools, voters will believe the problem is being handled, Kinney predicts. Contributing to this complacency will be the voters' memory of having passed a record $9.2-billion school bond issue last November.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Once it's perceived that a problem has been talked about enough and is being solved,\" Kinney says, \"people focus on a new issue.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As evidence, Kinney points to illegal immigration and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, hot issues that cooled after passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Crime also lost political punch after voters passed the three-strikes initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney bases his analyses on the voters' intensity of concern. He doesn't just ask people which issues they consider the most important, as pollsters usually do. He asks how important a specific issue is to them \"personally--on a scale of one to 10.\" Then he counts only the \"10s.\" The others can be swayed too easily to another view, he contends.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's polling at the end of 1998 showed education still at No. 1, but health care climbing; 80% called education a \"10,\" compared to 67% for health care. Crime was 35% and taxes 28%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Education will slip to fourth or fifth by midyear,\" he predicts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such public passivity is hard to imagine, however, given the latest bad news--screamed in headlines all over the state--that California ranks next to last nationally in fourth-grade reading skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, agrees with Kinney about the trend, but not the timing. \"Over a five-year period, he's right,\" Maslin says, \"But I'm not sure he's right over the next two years. I really believe we're a long way from this {education} thing playing out.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maslin does buy the thesis that health care and infrastructure--highways, potholes, water--will escalate as political issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"As the baby boomers get older, health care will become a lot more personal and worrisome,\" he notes. \"And the state's population is growing again. Well, guess what? We're going to have to figure out a way to build not only more schools, but more water pipes, more roads. . . . Is this state broken or not?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the new governor hasn't been focusing on much except promoting his school bills, mostly at campaign-style road shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis did announce in his State of the State address that he would create a \"Commission on Building for the 21st Century,\" under Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, to develop an infrastructure master plan. The panel was given a May 1 deadline to report back. But two months later, Davis still has not appointed the commission members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two Democratic legislative leaders seem more on the cutting edge of future issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles is sponsoring legislation to expand health care coverage for the working poor. There are 7 million uninsured Californians, he notes, and 40% live in L.A. County. \"Health care should be a right, not a privilege,\" asserts the potential mayoral candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco is pushing a $16-billion bond package to modernize the state's transportation system. Besides easing congestion, the liberal lawmaker says his proposal would boost California's economy. \"And if you don't have a growing economy that produces enough revenue to take care of working people and the poor,\" he adds, \"I have real emotional problems.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis should get out front and lead on these emerging issues, show he can handle more than one problem at a time. The Legislature won't wait. And if the pollster is right, the public may not either.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}

University of Texas, a case involving racial preferences in college admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims that she was denied admission to the university on account of her race. The school says that it's allowed to take race into account to achieve a diverse student body.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts was among the more aggressive questioners during oral arguments Wednesday, asking a lawyer for the school what constituted an acceptable \"critical mass\" of black and Hispanic students on campus and whether someone who was one-quarter or one-eighth Hispanic could claim that ethnicity on an application. He also suggested that the university is essentially setting percentage goals for minority students without acknowledging the practice. If Chief Justice Roberts is going to start voting with the court's liberals, he has an odd of showing it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Of course, the term ahead will provide many more opportunities for the chief justice to signal his sympathies,\" wrote Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog on Thursday. \"But yesterday's argument undermines the theory that Chief Justice Roberts switched teams for good.

This never gets easier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced Wednesday that one police officer would be charged, not in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, but with endangering her neighbors with reckless gunfire. \"If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice,\" Mr. Cameron said, in an apparent attempt to explain the lack of more serious charges relating to the 26-year-old's killing. \"Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cameron's use of the term \"mob justice\" to characterize protests by African-Americans who want officers who kill Black people with seeming impunity held responsible for their actions is curious phrasing, particularly from an attorney general from a Southern state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mob justice was literally used by Kentucky and other Southern states for decades to rule over Black people. Lynching and other racial terror tactics were deployed frequently, often with the help of the criminal justice system. Authorities were known to hand Black people to mobs who turned violence and spectacle into regional events. The news of an impending lynching would bring Southern white families to town squares on foot and by wagon. They arrived with picnic lunches and cameras to watch live examples of the devaluation of Black citizenship and the snuffing out of life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Ben Tobin of the Louisville Courier-Journal, \"between 1877 and 1934, lynchings of at least 186 African Americans took place in KY.\" This was mob justice. This represented repeated failures of the criminal justice system. This was a willful shunning of the nation's basic principles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All Ms. Taylor's family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we're so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it's not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. It's painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman's home late at night will face no consequences. Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years various media outlets have invited people to share stories about when they first realized they were Black. Often, the realizations came from some negative experience with racial prejudice: The time a white childhood friend couldn't invite them to a sleepover, or when a favorite high school teacher told them <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> would get them into a great college. We've frequently read and heard about the talks Black parents have with their children, explaining how racism can make people misconstrue their behavior, and about how teens must learn the etiquette of negotiating racial animus. Don't talk back. Look down. Say yes ma'am and yes sir.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what can prepare a person for the proper response to heavily armed cops in their home in the middle of the night? How could we have prepared Breonna Taylor? The answer is, we couldn't have. What could have prepared her family for the failure to hold the police officers in this case accountable? Nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have always known I was Black. I was raised in a segregated community, attended a racially segregated church, was bused across town to schools with more resources, watched \"Roots\" and \"Eyes on the Prize\" with my family and recited Margaret Walker poems in Black History Month programs. I was bathed in blackness from birth. I also knew fairly early on that not everyone viewed blackness through the same lens, and that I would be on the receiving end of racial hostility. I felt prepared for this eventuality. But when I was standing on High Street in front of Ohio State's campus and someone from a car full of white boys yelled a racial slur at me in broad daylight, with lots of people watching but not even acknowledging what happened, I learned there is never enough preparation. Not for the pugilistic ways that white supremacy can render you an afterthought of American democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That experience has stayed with me for over 20 years. The realization that no police officer will face consequences for killing Breonna Taylor will stay with me, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that the failure to indict a police officer for killing Ms. Taylor was unpredictable. It's that the emotional and political exhaustion surrounding the news was predictable. This is what inspires the rage and despair that Mr. Cameron cruelly and ahistorically dismissed as \"mob justice.\" This is what forces Black people to push for this nation to be better stewards of its ideal, while recalibrating our expectations time and time again.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of \"The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

Once a certain threshold is achieved, for much of their history colleges gave \u201cextra points\u201d to certain students, because their family members were alums, because a student excelled at a niche sport, because their wealthy parents made a significant donation or because they hailed from an underrepresented state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact that these legacies, scions, athletes and geographic admissions were almost always of the same race and similar socioeconomic classes was deemed unremarkable. In the late 1960s, in pursuit of a more diverse higher education experience, and to redress prior unexamined biases, schools began shifting some of these extra points toward students of color and students who were economically disadvantaged. Occasionally, students who excelled in tiny towns or at different sports were recognized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For generations a wide array of students has benefited from \u201c<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\u201d Yet today, for some reason, it\u2019s only the black and brown students who get labeled as such. And it is only they whom this administration seeks to deny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MALLORY DUNCAN, PARIS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By undercutting consideration of race in college admissions, President Trump is again appealing to white resentment of the \u201cprivilege\u201d associated with being a minority in America. This resentment has a root cause \u2014 lower social mobility here than in most other wealthy countries. To address this problem less cynically, we should explicitly include a second dimension to our <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts, based on economic status.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I believe that if we did, Mr. Trump would find a less receptive audience for his intentional divisiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MICHAEL FARZAN, JUNO BEACH, FLA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is high time we began to treat African-Americans and Latinos as equals when applying to college as well as all other arenas in life. To continue to condescend to people because of their race based on historical injustices simply promotes those injustices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we believe that we should not judge people by the color of their skin and should offer them equal opportunity, then we acknowledge and encourage their full human potential rather than treating them as inherently inferior.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TOM O\u2019HARE, BOSTON</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is interesting that the Trump administration is moving against any use of race as a measurement of diversity in education but makes no reference to gender. Why could that be? It is a well-known fact that many colleges and universities, including some of the most prestigious Ivy League schools, accept male applicants with lower SAT or ACT scores and lower grades than female applicants in order to achieve gender diversity (balance) in their incoming class.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Has there been a long history of discrimination against men in education in this country? Of course not \u2014 in fact just the opposite. So why is diversity acceptable when it comes to gender but not race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TOM BARNARDSHAKER HEIGHTS, OHIO</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398538903.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Useful distinctions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The phrase \"useful distinction\" seems to have lost its usefulness. It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of \"all or nothing.\" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate. Something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the California Civil Rights Initiative on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly and the other sponsors of CCRI have formed the American Civil Rights Institute to take their initiative campaign against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides nationwide. They're being bitterly opposed by the forces and groups who give the strong impression that merely to raise questions about the status of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to commit sin beyond forgiveness. But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's \"minority distress sale policy,\" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises \"complete control over the station's affairs.\" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved \"the important government objective of broadcast diversity.\" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently \"non-minorities,\" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added \"sweat equity\" and that he never gave up control of the company. \"It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,\" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies. But then when a CCRI-like effort emerges, its supporters are attacked as loonies beyond discussion. Under the circumstances, a revival of \"useful distinctions\" looks very much in order.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421987509.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Commentary; DAVID GELERNTER; To Dems, It's 1974 Forever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced recently that he is worried about the \"hard, hard right\" of the Republican Party, people whose goal is to turn \"the clock back to the 1930s or the 1890s.\" I've never met one myself. There is no such Republican in the president's Cabinet, none in the Senate, and Schumer is talking nonsense. He wants to conceal the Big Switch that has transformed American politics. Today the Democrats are the party of reactionary liberalism. Republicans are the true progressives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet if Schumer is mostly wrong, he is also unintentionally revealing. He seems to believe that \"hard right\" Republicans pine for the 1930s -- when statesmen like FDR and his disciples dominated the scene. He's right: Many Republicans do admire FDR. Republicans, after all, are his spiritual heirs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is serious business. If you agree that President Bush has no automatic right to call himself Lincoln's successor just because they are both \"Republicans,\" then Democrats have no automatic right to FDR's mantle either. The Democrats and Republicans switched roles while no one was looking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schumer is a main man for the Dems, architect of a fine new way of holding a knife to the Senate's throat. Democrats threaten to filibuster Bush judicial nominees; one touch of Schumer's magic wand and they can no longer be confirmed by majorities, only landslides. (How many Democratic senators won by landslides?) If Republicans change the rules to disallow such vindictiveness, Democrats promise to throw a fit and bring Senate business to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The filibuster scheme perfectly epitomizes modern Democrats. Republicans want to move forward, confirm some judges. The Democrats' response: Freeze! Or we talk you to death. Democrats are the Stand Still party. They adore the status quo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives won't settle for the status quo. They want this nation to champion justice, humanity, democracy. Democrats want America to tip-toe around the globe minding its own business, upsetting no one, venerating the Earth, etc. Why did Democrats leap to label Afghanistan and Iraq \"new Vietnams\"? Vietnam was 30-plus years ago! But for Democrats it is always 1974. Things change -- but Democrats don't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans want better schools: Why not try vouchers on a serious scale? Democrats' response: Hands off! Republicans want to knock the chip off the U.N.'s shoulder and retune Social Security so that even the poor can leave assets to their children. Democrats' response: Hands off! Conservatives wonder, why not let the people's representatives in state legislatures determine the nation's abortion policy? Democrats' response: Are you crazy? The smelly masses? Why is it their business?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today's Democrats dislike democracy on principle, like Russian nobility circa 1905. Should Bush be allowed to pick federal judges merely because Republicans won the presidency, the Senate, the House, the country? No way! And why let the people decide about homosexual marriage when left-wing judges can make the law? Connecticut's governor just signed a law approving civil unions for gays and also stipulating that \"marriage\" means a man and a woman. Whatever you think of the outcome, this is democracy -- Schumerite Democrats should check it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the nation's universities, an occasional conservative wonders whether just maybe racism, sexism and \"class-ism\" no longer explain every bad thing in the world. Could 30 years of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> be enough? There are tenured professors who can't even remember a world without it. The Democrats' response: Hands off <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people have noticed that today's political scene is confusing, hard to read -- Republicans wanting to save the world, Dems shouting \"mind your own business.\" Republicans worrying about poor people's stake in society, Dems muttering \"wake me up when it's over.\" Republicans sticking up for Israel, left-wing anti-Bush rallies toying with anti-Semitism. It's all terribly confusing, until you notice that you are looking at the picture upside down. Once you understand the Big Switch, everything starts to make sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Yale professor David Gelernter is a senior fellow at the Shalem Center, Jerusalem.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2633115690.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s racist killers are grotesque, but their \u2018hate crimes\u2019 prosecution was a show trial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If fractious Americans can agree on anything nowadays, it should be that the punishment of thought crimes is the odious essence of totalitarianism. So, consider the constitutionally dubious conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's three murderers for having committed \"hate crimes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The criminal justice system has now correctly concluded that his murderers were racists whose racism manifested itself in their actions. This conclusion, however, does not justify complacency about deciding that because the killers' gross acts reflected grotesque thinking, the thinking merits its own punishment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The killers chased Arbery \u2014 a Black jogger in a White neighborhood \u2014 and killed him with a shotgun. For this violation of Georgia's law against murder, a state court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Then this week, they were convicted in a federal court of violating a federal law that punishes those who violate a person's civil rights \"because of\" their \"race, color,\" etc. For this they can again be sentenced to life in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Jacob Sullum, senior editor of Reason, notes: It is therefore \"equally true that the defendants were convicted 'because of' their benighted beliefs. Condemning them as bigots was the whole point of this exercise, since they had already been condemned (and punished) as murderers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This misuse of judicial proceedings was, Sullum says, possible because of two regrettable Supreme Court conclusions: The killers' \"second, symbolic prosecution did not amount to double jeopardy, because the state and federal crimes, defined by two different 'sovereigns,' are not 'the same offense.'\" And prosecutions of hate crimes are deemed consistent with the First Amendment, even if they impose added punishment for speech that, however scabrous, is nevertheless constitutionally protected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, the government can conduct trials for the purpose of virtue signaling \u2014 to announce, however redundantly, that it condemns particular frames of mind. A bigot's shabby mental furniture is, however, not a crime. Were it, what other mentalities might government decide to stigmatize by imposing special punishments? Arbery's killers had expressed their racism in speech (texts, social media posts, remarks) that no jurisdiction can proscribe. But their federal punishment will be imposed precisely because their speech demonstrated their bigotry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Proving the intent behind a criminal act is crucial. And no principle should prohibit ever making punishment proportional to the motive for a criminal act. However, deciding that an actor's heinous behavior is made more heinous because they had a bad attitude is dangerous. It is one thing for the law to hold individuals responsible for controlling their minds, which presumably control their bodies. It is quite another thing for government to inventory an individual's mind for the purpose of declaring how admirable the government's mind is, and perhaps by doing so to improve the public's mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This impulse melds with what C.S. Lewis called the remedial theory of punishment, whereby government detains offenders until they are cured, as determined by government's \"official straighteners.\" Another totalitarian temptation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only an engaged judiciary vigorously applying constitutional protections prevents the woke from greasing this nation's slide into something like Europe's increasingly minute supervision of speech \u2014 and of the mentalities speech reflects. The European Court of Human Rights says governments may \"sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred.\" By \"even prevent,\" the ECHR evidently extends permission for preemptive censorship and punishment. Based on what?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In today's America, \"hate speech\" has become an elastic concept stretched to encompass any expression of ideas \u2014 e.g., opposition to race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or saying marriage should be between a man and a woman \u2014 that offends any of the plethora of easily offended factions. So, various colleges and universities have proscribed speech that might \"annoy or otherwise inconvenience\" anyone, and certain \"attitudes,\" and \"verbal harm\" from injurious \"assumptions\" or \"implications.\" They have guaranteed \"freedom from indignity of any type\" and protection from \"patronizing remarks.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional grandstanding includes the promiscuous multiplication of federal crimes, many of them duplicative of state crimes. From Congress's bottomless moral pork barrel comes proposals for niche hate crime legislation: The latest, the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, was signed into law May 20 last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government is failing conspicuously at many basic things \u2014 budgeting, preserving the currency's value, maintaining infrastructure, educating children, etc. Surely government should economize its exertions by not conducting show trials for the purpose of highlighting \u2014 perhaps for the public's moral improvement \u2014 that it is offended by certain thinking that can precede certain behaviors that are already criminalized and forcefully punished.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}

It's probably the person the President accused of creating the impression of heartless foolishness by defining ketchup as a school-lunch vegetable. Instead of firing the culprit, they must have transferred him/her to Personnel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How else explain the move to select Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation? That is the already battered Federal program of aid for people who need lawyers but can't afford them. And how else explain the nomination of William Bell, a Detroit pol with no accomplishments in management or civil rights, to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission? This not the first time this Administration has looked to foxes to guard chickens, but the effort is becoming suspiciously obvious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Reagan team, to be sure, tried at first to kill the legal services program directly. But Congress, which is still supposed to write the laws, refused. The level of funding and terms of operation were then compromised, but the White House will not quit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although there is an ample supply of candidates with legal aid experience, Mr. Zumbrun has never been near that bar. He has denounced the law that he would now administer. He has vigorously opposed the program both as a California official and as president of the Pacific Legal Foundation. His preference in legal aid is helping those needy corporations that oppose Government regulation, clean water standards and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Zumbrun would devour his agency, Mr. Bell would probably just strangle his. He is black and has no known hostility to the idea of promoting equal employment. But the minority recruiting firm he leads hasn't placed a single employee this year. The Detroit company, Bold Concepts, Inc., has no phone listing. Its leader is little known in his own city and unknown to the civil rights community. His only recognized asset is political labor for Mr. Reagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nomination of Mr. Zumbrun would insult the poor and the legal profession. The nomination of Mr. Bell is an insult to workers of any race or sex and also to managements that find themselves in job bias disputes. Instead of pressing these appointments, the White House headhunters had better find the saboteur in their own cave.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 29s "}}
