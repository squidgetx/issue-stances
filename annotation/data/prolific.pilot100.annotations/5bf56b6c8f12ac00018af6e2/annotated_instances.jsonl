Education Today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of diversity has taken on new meaning since Sept. 11.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suddenly from a nation of atomized individuals we became a collective, in fear, mourning and awareness of having a common identity and perhaps a common fate as Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that collective it suddenly seemed very important that we had many kinds of names and faces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of us began seeing faces we hadn't noticed before. Non- Muslims became aware of Muslims as people to be encountered in an emotional, almost intimate way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On college campuses students began flocking to classes on topics most hadn't much cared about before: Afghanistan, the Middle East, international relations, Islam, Arabic language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most important, Americans, in looking in each other's faces and hearing each other's prayers, sought a renewed faith that differences of color or religion or ethnic background don't have to lead to implacable enmity and mutual destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context it is worth reconsidering the venerable arguments about whether furthering diversity on college campuses constitutes a compelling national interest to the extent that universities should consider race and ethnicity in their admissions policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A series of conflicting court decisions in the last year have brought the debate over what is called the \"diversity rationale\" to a fever pitch, and the U.S. Supreme Court may have the final say. Different federal judges have ruled that race-conscious admissions policies are permissible to foster diversity for University of Michigan undergraduates, but not at the law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other jurists have decided that such policies are fitting at the University of Washington law school, but not for undergraduates at the University of Georgia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Implementation of such policies is different at each school, and the varied techniques may have played some part in the decisions. But the arguments on both sides always come back to the issue of whether diversity is a compelling enough interest to warrant going beyond tests and numbers in the direction of race and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The diversity rationale has taken the place of another accepted standard--remedying vestiges of past racial discrimination--because past bias is hard to pin down, especially outside the South. Diversity as a positive educational goal, beneficial to all students in an institution, makes a more compelling case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is of immediate importance only in flagship public universities throughout the country, as other state schools generally admit the vast majority of applicants. Private schools, however, might be held to whatever standard is finally applied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going to the right college, or to a top law or business or medical school, means a lot in this country. Not everything, fortunately, but still a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to insist that merit, determined by the test scores and grades, should be the only admission standard. We are all equal before the numbers, which are blind to color, gender and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But merit obviously takes many forms, and numbers themselves can be relative. Is a 1300 SAT score by a New Trier student from a wealthy family really more meritorious than an 1100 by a low-income teenager from the South Side?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clearly there is some lower limit on capability: Students must be able to do the work. And some studies show comparatively high dropout rates for students admitted to selective schools through <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there also is evidence that such students actually do better at top schools than their counterparts (for instance, black students with similar test scores) at less-selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crucial question is whether, in a world in which pluralistic values suddenly seem so important, the top schools can afford to cut minority admissions. One landmark study says a race-blind policy could slice the number of black students at these schools to as little as a quarter of the current total.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor said in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that she has given the issue a lot of thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"How does one see that we're not all the same, that we haven't traveled the same path and that we have to be able to see the world from the other person's eyes? That for me is at the center of why I believe so firmly that higher education has to be diverse,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't naturally come to see other sides; we need to learn how to do that, we need to have the social context and the learning context where we can get outside of ourselves.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after Sept. 11, students felt vulnerable and wanted to reach out to others without quite knowing how, she added. And of course there were ugly incidents, including a brawl in a campus bar after an attack on an Indian student.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What I keep saying at events here is that it's terribly important in a crisis to see people as individuals and not as groups, not as a religion,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"For many of our students, college life is the first time they actually have a chance to live and work in a diverse environment.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of the diversity rationale say you can have stimulating, diverse ideas without a diverse student body. Not so. There is no substitute for that direct encounter with someone whose difference is a challenge to the heart and mind.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 22m 15s "}}

ANALYSIS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The presidential race in many ways can now be reduced to this: a contest between the lovers and the haters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lovers are those who hold great affection for George W. Bush, his philosophy of government, his socially conservative beliefs and his resolve on issues like Iraq and the war on terrorism. The haters are those who can't stand the president for precisely the same reasons. There hasn't been a grand embrace of challenger John Kerry, and even in the waning days before the election, a Kerry agenda is still not easy to define.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the country were electing a debater in chief, after three rounds, most would give the title to the Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His performances were more even and consistent, his presentation of facts and command of issues more clear. On this night, his burden was obvious: to persuade people to deny the president a second term, to point out with precision what the haters hate most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The motivation to vote against someone is often more powerful than the desire to vote for someone, and in that sense, the president faces a perilous finish to the campaign. He will be relying on his legion of lovers and hope that the haters have hit the wall. He is still stoking the energy of Republican partisans, painting Kerry with the familiar \"out of the mainstream\" brush, while Kerry seems to believe there are still people to be won over in the increasingly small lane in the middle of the road, especially undecided women voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 90-minute session focused almost entirely on the issues that form the fault lines of American politics--abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage, faith, taxes and the role of government in health care and education. On each of those issues, the debate served to outline distinct differences between the two men.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clear choice</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all the things that voters might say they lack when they cast ballots in November, a clear choice should not be one of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incumbent president in a time of war and a troubled economy faced the greater challenge to defend his record. There were simply more targets for Kerry to attack. But the president also played on the dangers the nation faces as part of his contention that a chance for Kerry is not a chance worth taking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the president was put on the defensive several times, especially about the economy. Asked what he might say to a worker who had lost a job to outsourcing to a foreign country with lower wages, the president responded that education was the best kind of government jobs program in the long run. How that will play in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Missouri, which have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, is unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry repeatedly played to a theme of class warfare that has been a Democratic staple since Franklin Roosevelt, but without Roosevelt's rhetorical gifts for empathy. Kerry also sounded echoes of Bill Clinton (\"people who work hard and play by the rules\"), but his style would never be confused with Clinton's either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Social issues</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On social issues, the president was far clearer in ways that will no doubt help him energize Republican partisans, but might be unlikely to win over many in the shrinking pool of undecided voters. He said he didn't know if homosexuality were a \"choice\" as opposed to a birthright, but he reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In addition, he refused the chance to say that a woman had a constitutional right to choice on abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That provided a clear opening to Kerry to appeal to women voters, whom polls suggest have been gravitating toward the Democrat since the first debate in Coral Gables, Fla., last month. Kerry said he would only support a justice to the Supreme Court who believed in the constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Loaded lines</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each candidate clearly entered the debate with a couple of loaded lines that they were ready to fire off at an appropriate moment. Neither man's effort was particularly successful, but the president's almost-forced efforts to caricature Kerry as a Massachusetts liberal to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy appeared to fall decidedly flat, except to the hard-core partisans who can never hear enough of that kind of talk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They no doubt also enjoyed Bush's dig at the integrity of the major broadcast network news operations. For his part, Kerry's analogy to Tony Soprano is unlikely to be part of any permanent debate highlight reel either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning the presidency, of course, is about much more than winning a debate and the personal connection that a candidate makes has become fundamentally important in the age of television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president offered more personal warmth than he had in the other debates, particularly when discussing his wife, Laura. Kerry still cannot match Bush's ability to make a personal connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the night of this final debate, he seemed to be quite conscious of a steady, dispassionate gaze at Kerry when he was talking, and of keeping his own voice lower. His supporters like it when he shows a little fight and fire, though.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore's biggest mistake of his presidential campaign in 2000 might well have been that he offered three different personas in his three debates with George Bush. Bush was no Gore in that respect, but he did seem to adjust his style from one debate to the next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry has used the three debates to great advantage, especially relative to the president, gaining credibility with each. The president righted himself in the second debate in St. Louis and did little to hurt or distinguish himself in Tempe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Final national plea</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's debate in Tempe likely signaled the last big national moment of the campaign, the final time when millions of Americans paid intense attention to the race. The candidates are likely to revert to rote of their stump speeches and the grind of travel from tarmac to tarmac, narrowcast to hit as many select television markets as possible. Good morning, Dayton. Good morning, Des Moines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incumbents who don't win debates, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, haven't fared well on Election Day. There is a presumption in the electorate that presidents are supposed to be able to perform on television under pressure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are supposed to be able not only to defend their term in office but to persuade that they deserve another. The president has three more weeks to make that case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush and Sen.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398920534.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Sound of Silence</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A young man in Washington is in danger of losing his job because of something this page published, which prompts me to say, in his defense: He didn't do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The young man works on the Republican staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where I hope Orrin Hatch is reading this. Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as \"news.\" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"The groups\" object to Mr. Estrada \"because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,\" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: \"We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas.\" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to \"hold off\" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case. To quote: \"The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted \"to keep the partisanship down.\" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as \"most of Bush's nominees are nazis.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave \"pending the outcome of the full investigation.\" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer \"improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports.\" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded? And why is no one reporting the much bigger story of the memos?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Kirkpatrick is the Journal's associate editorial page editor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Partisan Wrangles\" -- WSJ Dec. 9, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: A Violation of Trust by Judiciary Panel Staffers\" -- WSJ Dec. 15, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor:A Violation of Clear Thinking by the Senator\" -- WSJ Dec. 18, 2003)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 40s "}}

And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a thousand times [and] remarked that he -- her father, my papaw -- had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do. ... Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, trying to explain why she identified herself as a \"minority\" law professor in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IT happens in a lot of American families. My maternal great-grandfather was born on a Maine island in the 1880s, in the days when Penobscot Indians still rode birch-bark canoes from their inland reservation to the coast for their annual clambake. I always had the definite idea that he had Indian blood himself -- maybe Penobscot, maybe Abenaki, maybe another New England tribe. In the photographs I have of him, he certainly looks the part, with a profile suited for an Indian Head penny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My great-grandfather left an autobiography behind, though (that's how I know about the canoes and the clambake), and I went back to it recently and couldn't find even a hint of an Indian connection: just a typical old New England genealogy, mostly English families with some Irish woven in. This would have been immensely disappointing to my 10-year-old self, since I can remember telling friends in American history class, with an air of authority, that I was almost certainly one sixteenth Native American, or at the very least one thirty-second.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems that Elizabeth Warren may turn out to be similarly disappointed, after the New England Genealogical Society acknowledged last week that there's no firm evidence of her great-great-grandmother being Cherokee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That supposed ancestral tie was what inspired the professor-turned-Senate candidate to identify as an ethnic minority in law school directories early in her career. More important, it was what inspired The Harvard Crimson to refer to Warren as Harvard Law School's \"one tenured minority woman\" and The Fordham Law Review to cite her as Harvard Law's \"first woman of color\" during the mid-1990s debates over faculty diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that same claim -- and her clumsy, \"my grandfather had high cheekbones\" attempts to defend it -- has become perhaps the biggest obstacle in her quest to reclaim Ted Kennedy's Senate seat for liberalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole story has a tragicomic, Nathaniel Hawthorne meets \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" feel. It's easy to imagine Warren originally checking a box more on a whim than out of any deep determination to self-identify as Cherokee. (She didn't use the minority-applicant program when applying to Rutgers, where she attended law school, and she identified as \"white\" during an early teaching job at the University of Texas.) Then it's easy to imagine her embarrassment when the diversity wars of the 1990s made that whimsical choice something from which she couldn't dissociate herself without intense public awkwardness. Those wars faded, she no longer listed herself as a Native American, she thought the whole thing was behind her ... until she went into politics, where no secret stays buried.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appropriate response to such a tale is probably sympathy rather than scorn. What does deserve scorn, though, is the academic culture in which an extremely distant connection to a Cherokee ancestor ends up being touted by a law school as proof of its commitment to diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diverse faculty and campus can be a laudable goal. But the point is to build academic communities that actually contain a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, not to wax self-congratulatory because you've met a set of ethnic quotas. The story of Elizabeth Warren, \"woman of color,\" represents a reductio ad absurdum of the latter tendency, which has been all too prevalent in elite universities -- giving us <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs that benefit West Indian immigrants more than the descendants of slaves, and faculties that include a wider range of skin tones than of political and religious views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The irony is that Warren herself probably did make Harvard more diverse, since she grew up the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma -- not a typical background, to put it mildly, for Ivy League students and faculty today. But under the academy's cramped definitions, it was her grandfather's Cherokee cheekbones, not her blue-collar roots, that led to her citation as a supposed trailblazer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't a serious approach to academic diversity, and in an emerging majority-minority America (already visible in the latest Census birth statistics) where almost everyone will be 1/8 something-or-other, it will be an increasingly untenable one as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many colleges and universities, then, this contretemps represents a timely gift: a chance to think anew about these issues, before the pursuit of a cosmetic diversity leaves them looking as ridiculous as poor Elizabeth Warren does today.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398321574.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>On Brown v. Board of Education, Call Him Thurgood Thomas</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP board is scheduled to decide today whether to join the interest groups that oppose a black Supreme Court nominee. Benjamin Hooks has said his group would have preferred another Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP should know that when it comes to the Supreme Court's most important civil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another Thurgood Marshall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all the smoke cooked up by Judge Thomas's critics, no one seems to have noticed that he takes precisely the same broad view of the constitutional promise of equality that Mr. Marshall as the lawyer arguing Brown v. Board of Education tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court to adopt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rights movement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshall worked. The justices finally declared that separate but equal facilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senate perpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate that the court struck down these racist laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Brown is a classic example of a correct result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely on dubious sociological data on how much better black students supposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms as whites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies in publications such as the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research. It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal,\" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing \"Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court missed the forest for the trees. \"The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,\" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the \"first principles of equality and liberty\" would \"lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. \"The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,\" the brief said. \"Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, \"Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,\" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is \"not without some good points,\" he said, adding that \"if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 22s "}}

Northern Virginia today offers a snapshot of how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, intended as a benevolent effort to prevent discrimination, has hardened into an ugly war on achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest fuss was kicked off before Christmas when Asra Nomani, an India-born mom and reporter, wrote a piece for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal detailing how her son's Virginia high school never informed him he'd been recognized by the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology -- known as \"TJ\" and regularly ranked America's No. 1 high school -- said they had the same experience. So Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation on Jan. 4. Days later, principals at two more Fairfax County high schools, Westfield and Langley, admitted they too had failed to inform student award winners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Miyares then expanded his investigation to all Fairfax County. No sooner had he done so than neighboring Loudoun County reported that three of its high schools had delayed notifying its students -- though officials insisted it wasn't intentional. On Friday, four more Fairfax high schools fessed up, followed by another on Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Merit Scholarship Program is a competition of 1.5 million students, based on their scores on the Preliminary Standard Achievement Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. \"Commended Students\" rank in the top 3%, while \"Semifinalists\" test in the top 1%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's an achievement that can make a difference on a college or scholarship application. But the kids who weren't told they were National Merit winners, or were told too late, couldn't include it on their applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given that the program leaves notifications up to the individual schools, it's possible that all these failures were bureaucratic snafus. But the context offers a less generous reading. Public education in Fairfax County has become the front line for an equity agenda that has hardened into a war on achievers, who are disproportionately Asian-American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a federal judge pointed out in 2022 in a case contesting TJ's new admissions policy, the Fairfax County School Board eliminated the merit-based entrance exam to make room for African-American and Hispanic students by reducing the number of Asian-Americans. In that sense it \"worked.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The class admitted before the change was 73.05% Asian-American, 3.29% Hispanic and 1.23% African-American. After the change, these figures went to 54.36%, 11.27% and 7.09%, respectively. The share of white students grew from 17.70% to 22.36%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meantime, in October district officials signed a $455,000 contract for strategic planning with consultant Mutiu Fagbayi of Performance Fact Inc. A PowerPoint presentation he'd already delivered at a September 2022 Fairfax County School Board retreat defines equity as \"equal outcomesfor every student,without exception.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or consider Shawnna Yashar, another TJ mom, whose son wasn't told he was a commended student until after the deadline for his early admissions application. Ms. Yashar says that when she complained to TJ's director of student services, Brandon Kosatka, he told her that the school wants \"to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,\" and that it delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of those who didn't qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard not to notice that those who paid the price for this approach were overwhelmingly Asian-American, judging by the names on the National Merit Semifinalists' list published by Fairfax County. Asian-Americans at TJ accounted for 101 of the 132 winners, or 77%. At Langley it was 10 of 15 (66%), and for Westfield it was four of five (80%).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asian-Americans make up only 18.97% of the student population of the Fairfax County public schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes Asian-American achievement so resented by our equity warriors is that it exposes as false the narrative about an irredeemably racist America where minorities can't succeed. This progressive disdain for Asian-Americans is amplified by a resentment of moms and dads who believe they should have a say in their kids' educations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Virginia, parents watched teachers unions agitate to keep classrooms closed during Covid. They learned the National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration to regard angry parents who showed up to public meetings demanding accountability as domestic terrorists. And they heard a schools superintendent in Loudoun County lying to them about a brutal sexual assault of a 15-year-girl in a school bathroom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now these same officials want parents, especially Asian-American parents, to believe that not informing their children that they won a prestigious academic competition was an innocent oversight. We'll see what the attorney general finds. But nothing these school officials have done has earned them a presumption of trust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398538903.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Useful distinctions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The phrase \"useful distinction\" seems to have lost its usefulness. It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of \"all or nothing.\" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate. Something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the California Civil Rights Initiative on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly and the other sponsors of CCRI have formed the American Civil Rights Institute to take their initiative campaign against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides nationwide. They're being bitterly opposed by the forces and groups who give the strong impression that merely to raise questions about the status of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is to commit sin beyond forgiveness. But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's \"minority distress sale policy,\" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises \"complete control over the station's affairs.\" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved \"the important government objective of broadcast diversity.\" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently \"non-minorities,\" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added \"sweat equity\" and that he never gave up control of the company. \"It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,\" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies. But then when a CCRI-like effort emerges, its supporters are attacked as loonies beyond discussion. Under the circumstances, a revival of \"useful distinctions\" looks very much in order.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}

But sometimes it really is more enlightening to watch the paint dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important changes, in other words, are often the most imperceptible. That's the case with one of the most overlooked stories of the past year: the return of American optimism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is more unusual than it seems. Americans may be, by nature, optimistic about their personal situations. But for most of the past 25 years, precious little of that optimism was evident when they looked toward their country's future. With only brief exceptions since the early 1970s, a majority of Americans--often an overwhelming majority--told pollsters they believed the country was on the wrong track.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, in its attitude toward the future, America is beginning to resemble the country it was through the early 1960s. Though some surveys still produce more ambivalent responses, most polls now show that a plurality of Americans believe the country is moving in the right direction. Consumer confidence is at a 28-year high. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of all Americans described themselves as \"highly contented\" with their lives--by far the highest figure recorded in the past 30 years. Even President Clinton is enjoying his rosiest approval ratings ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have not surrendered their pessimism lightly. But it has been beaten down by a pitiless procession of good news. The economy, now in its sixth year of growth, has driven down unemployment to its lowest level in a quarter century. The federal budget deficit, which once threatened to submerge Washington, is evaporating like a puddle on a sunny day. Crime is way down, and the rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth are stabilizing after years of explosive growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The return of American optimism, though, is arguably rooted in something more fundamental than any of this. After more than a decade of doubt, America once again considers itself the capital of the future. During the 1980s, many Americans glumly concluded that the 21st century would be forged in places like Tokyo and Taipei. Now, Americans see the future being shaped in Seattle (home of Microsoft, the emblematic company of the Information Age), Hollywood (which sets the beat for global culture) and Silicon Valley (the Finland Station for the computer and Internet revolutions). \"Is this a great time, or what?\" asks MCI in a revealing ad campaign that would have been laughed off the air not long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Very few politicians have considered the implications of governing a society in which optimism about the future is again the default position. But if it lasts, this rebirth of American confidence could change politics in ways both subtle and profound.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, both the left and the right have framed much of their agenda around constructing a convincing explanation for the anxiety that gnawed at many Americans. Conservatives pointed their fingers at big government, welfare, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, immigrants and the forces of cultural change; liberals targeted the rich, the global economy and big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this more optimistic environment, though, those demons are losing their horns. \"There is just less hostility out there,\" says Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. \"It is a lot easier to get people agitated when things aren't going well.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some respects, the politics of international trade remains the great exception to this pattern. Yet even the House rebellion against fast-track trade authority in November marked a subtle shift in attitudes. Ten years ago, trade anxieties focused on the fear that the U.S. could not compete with Japan in the most technologically advanced sectors. Today, trade anxieties are almost completely limited to the fear that the U.S. will lose low-skill jobs to low-wage countries such as Mexico. That's not a trivial concern, but it's a long way from the fear of national economic decline that haunted the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The continued skirmishing over trade doesn't obscure the power of Hart's observation. In good times, it's difficult to mobilize the public behind ideological crusades. In these circumstances, voters prefer incrementalism, not sudden change; rather than polarization, they look for convergence. (Clinton has understood this far better than those Republicans still clamoring for more confrontation.) These days, the dominant message from Americans to their capital seems to be: Get along, compromise and stay out of our way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That message can be very much of a mixed blessing. Indeed, the same can be said about the overall brightening of American attitudes. The good news is that the improved public mood encourages both parties to pursue reasonable compromises on the issues dividing them--as they did to balance the budget last summer. But the risk is that the good feelings can easily slide into triumphalism and complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, for all the positive trends, America still faces serious problems: too many lackluster schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, the impending cost of retiring the baby boom, inner cities where both opportunity and fathers are scarce. History suggests the good times are precisely the moment to tackle such difficult challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the prosperity from the end of World War II to the 1973 oil shock, the GI generation laid the foundation for growth: building the interstate highway system and great public universities, subsidizing the development of the semiconductor and the Internet. At the same time, the nation enlarged the circle of opportunity by ending segregation and filled in the social safety net by guaranteeing health care for the elderly and poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That record offers the standard against which history is likely to judge today's leaders. At the moment, Clinton and his Republican rivals appear content to mostly preside over this era of good feelings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the precedent of America's long postwar boom offers a more productive alternative: investing prosperity to sustain prosperity and share its benefits more widely. The lack of public demand for a more ambitious agenda doesn't obviate the need for one. Pessimism is a corrosive force in a nation's life. But so is complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: JEFF DANZIGER / For The Times; ID NUMBER: 19980105hmn0108</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: This is Ronald Brownstein's last Washington Outlook column</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 49s "}}
