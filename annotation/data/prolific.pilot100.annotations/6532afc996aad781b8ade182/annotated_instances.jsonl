The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But now my right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for ''the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then to the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired? Oh, we know your editors insist that ''diversity'' had nothing to do with it. But remember what Senator Dale Bumpers said about our impeachment of Clinton: ''When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex' -- it's about sex.'' This is about diversity backfiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's my reply to their Kulturkampf: For exactly 30 years, I have been supported handsomely for disagreeing with The Times's editorial page, which is dovish on defense, leftist on economics and (with the exception of civil liberties) resolutely wrongheaded. Never have I been silenced, and conservative thinkers have an ever-fairer shake on the Op-Ed page.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for news coverage being influenced by editorial policy, I evoke the name of my predecessor: that's a Krock. On occasion, a leftist slant on a story slips through the backfield, but with conservatives boring from within and fulminating from without, the news side soon straightens itself out. What is ''fit to print'' is the truth as straight as we can tell it, which is why Times people are so furious at this galling breach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now about the supposed cost of diversity: A newspaper is free to come down on the side of giving black journalists a break if its owners and editors so choose. What's more, this media world would also benefit from more Hispanics and Asians coming up faster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the 375 Times reporters who make up the greatest assemblage of talent and enterprise in the field of gathering and writing the news, I submit this hard line:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Self-examination is healthy but self-absorption is not; self-correction is a winner but self-flagellation is a sure loser. Let us slap a metaphoric cold steak over our huge black eye and learn from this dismaying example -- so that other journalists in the nation and around the world can continue to learn from ours.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}

You wanted guys not with the biggest muscles, but the most heart. Not the mopers who would walk off the field when they felt the first raindrops or got bumped in the nose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You looked for the kids who really wanted to play--and to win.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so it is as well in the bruising contact sport of politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You want candidates with fire in the belly, defined by William Safire in his \"New Political Dictionary\" as \"an unquenchable thirst for power or glory; the burning drive to win a race or achieve a goal.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They make the best candidates because they run with enthusiasm. And if elected, they're less likely to goof off or to whine, like so many politicians and athletes, about adversity and their sacrifice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I thought about this last week when the entry deadline for the gubernatorial race passed and three potential candidates--two stars and a prospect--remained on the sidelines. They didn't have the fire in the belly to compete. And that caused a lot of bellyaching within the political establishment--mostly among Democrats--about being stuck with the reserves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We deserve better. What a choice!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, time out. Quit the moaning. Like it or not, one of these four people will be California's next governor: Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, 51; or a Democrat--Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, 55; zillionaire airline exec Al Checchi, 49; or Rep. Jane Harman, 52, of Torrance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They've all got the fire--the energy and the courage--to fight for the most important elective office to be filled in America this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as Checchi campaign manager Darry Sragow points out: \"The absolute truth is the republic will survive with any of these four at the helm.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's play could've-should've for a moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 64, could have been a great governor. But she's very comfortable in her current job and dreaded getting roughed up in a gubernatorial race. She was flinching. So Feinstein is better off staying in the Senate, where she excels, and the state probably is better off too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leon Panetta, 59--former Monterey congressman and White House chief of staff--had promise. He could have been an excellent governor. But he wasted all last year deferring to fellow Democrat Feinstein. She didn't bow out until Jan. 20, too late for him to get organized. If Panetta actually had the fire, however, he would have spent last year traveling the state, showing concern for its problems, raising money and positioning himself to run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, 67, teased the news media and basked in the begging before concluding that he was just too comfortable--to run or to serve. \"Be careful, you might get what you're going after,\" Riordan said he told himself. \"I love California, but Los Angeles is still my No. 1 love.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fine. Then he made the right decision to stay there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But please spare us the spin about how the mayor was a virtual cinch winner. First, he had to beat Lungren for the GOP nomination. Lungren is a good Republican; Riordan is a good Republican mostly in the eyes of Democrats. He endorsed Feinstein in 1994 and didn't support either the anti-illegal immigration or anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> initiatives. He was a fat target for Lungren. Plus, he's not very good on the stump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new open primary certainly would have helped. But we'll never know whether enough Democrats would have crossed over to nominate Riordan for the Republicans. That's awfully iffy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we're left with is a wide-open race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls show Davis leading in the Democratic contest. But Checchi--having already spent more than $4 million of his fortune on TV ads--is moving up fast. In mock general elections, both Davis and Checchi run about even with Lungren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harman is the only woman in the race and that's presumed to be a plus. But she's a late entry and unknown outside L.A. She urgently needs to develop a compelling message and to spend millions of her own dollars getting it out on TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a myth that Harman also is the only moderate running. Davis still gets tagged as a liberal because two decades ago he was Gov. Jerry Brown's top aide, but basically he's a moderate. And Checchi? He wants to execute serial rapists. That's hardly liberal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've got a race between three experienced pols and an outsider--Checchi--who frequently hasn't even voted. However, he did spend all last year stumping the state boning up on issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe these aren't the best governors conceivable. But they're the most eager. They've got the fire and really want the job. The others refused to run. It's time to stop grousing and start choosing</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly against": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398730713.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>On Media Bias, Network Stars Are Rather Clueless</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dan Rather has been on television more than usual lately, popping up all over the place promoting his book about American success stories and along the way wearily denying that he's the left-wing devil some conservatives think he is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same old story as far as Dan is concerned. The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imagination. Case closed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, as just about everyone who lives between Manhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening newscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74% of Republicans spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47% of Democrats agreed, believing that \"most journalists are more liberal than they are.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of course, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the news and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. They're denying it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them if there's a liberal bias on their newscasts, they'd all say \"no\" and they'd all pass the test.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . . [a] negative sign on you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words \"left wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with with the anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or pro-life lobbies?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media elites can float through their personal lives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealthy and sometimes downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the brilliant film critic at The New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Nixon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: \"Nobody I know voted for Nixon.\" Never mind that Nixon carried 49 states. She wasn't kidding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on liberal bias it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and Peter: Stop telling us that we're the problem, and start thinking about what liberal bias really means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Goldberg was a correspondent for CBS News from 1972 until 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Reporters Need Course In Basic Capitalism\" -- WSJ June 5, 2001)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 8m 11s "}}

In their different ways the two societies will be preoccupied by the dynamics of internal power. Any attempt by the two Governments to do business with each other will be conditioned on those twin realities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new Soviet leader will no doubt be cautious as he builds support. And he will share the general Russian view of Ronald Reagan as the most hostile American President in memory. He will have little incentive in foreign policy to take steps that would help Mr. Reagan win re-election - not, at least, unless and until Mr. Reagan looks a sure winner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The death of Yuri Andropov, in short, makes it even less likely that there can be any resolution this year of the major issues that divide the two superpowers. Indeed, meaningful negotiation on matters of substance is a remote prospect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Must we, then, resign ourselves to Soviet-American relations continuing for the rest of this year at their present icy level, with hardly any communication between the dominant powers on earth? Is there nothing that can be suggested by way of hope?  No, it seems to me that there are some realistic possibilities in this political year. They are modest, as they must be in the circumstances. But they might open the way for efforts to work out the larger issues, most urgently arms control, next year.  One negative principle is important. This is not a time - if there ever is a time - when either side should undertake to put the other to a test.  At a minimum the two countries do not want the tensions between them to become more dangerous. In a period of political sensitivity, that means the Russians should avoid new geographical thrusts or provocations. It would be just as dangerous for the United States to take steps that look like deliberate challenges to the Soviet Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the affirmative possibility of signals: actions that may not themselves constitute a change in international policy but that suggest a desire to do diplomatic business. Here I think the crucial need now is for each side to signal a degree of respect for the other's concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Soviet side, one human gesture would have a great effect on opinion in America and elsewhere in the West. That is to ease up on the repression of dissidents. The potent symbolic step would be to release the three most prominent victims of the repression: Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Shcharansky.  Andrei Sakharov, the great physicist exiled to Gorky and harassed there by the K.G.B., wrote a letter to scientific colleagues in the Soviet Union and abroad that is published in the current New York Review of Books. It is a heart-rending document.  The Sakharov letter appeals for help in getting the Soviet authorities to let his wife, Elena Bonner, go abroad for medical treatment. She has had several heart attacks and has no way of getting proper care. In a further message dated Jan. 12, Mr. Sakharov said: ''Only a trip to receive medical treatment abroad can save her life, and mine as well, since her death would mean my death.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yuri Orlov, another physicist, was arrested seven years ago for setting up a committee to monitor Soviet compliance with the Helsinki agreements. He has reportedly been treated with special harshness in a labor camp at Perm. He was due for release from there this past Friday - but some experts fear that his term will be extended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anatoly Shcharansky, an activist in both the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, has been in prison in Chistopol for nearly six years now. His mother saw him on Jan. 5 and said he was in severe pain from a heart condition and so emaciated that he was ''unrecognizable.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soviet leaders evidently do not understand what a terrible impact such cases have in the West - have specifically on the possibilities for negotiation. But there is an American failure of understanding, too. That is President Reagan's inability, if it is that, to appreciate the effect he creates in the Soviet Union by his bellicose and insulting rhetoric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Malcolm Toon, U.S. Ambassador in Moscow from 1976 to 1979, is known for taking a tough line toward the Soviets. But when I talked with him after Mr. Andropov's death, he said essential business cannot be done with them if American rhetoric makes them think our aim is their destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''For us as concerned Americans,'' Mr. Toon said, ''the important question is which is the real Reagan: the guy who made the awful 'evil empire' speech in Orlando? Or the one who made the speech in the White House last month, helpful but long overdue?  Frankly, I don't know which. And I think the Russians are confused - they don't really know if he's out to do them in.''</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is not mentioned.": "3"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2648708177.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Teach '1619' and '1776' U.S. History; The answer to ideological education isn't to ban the ideology but to make room for alternative views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom has it that there are only two sides in the culture war over kids' instruction on race and racism in America. Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an \"Antiracist Audit\" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which \"strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion\u2014that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways\u2014as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism\u2014he does\u2014but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. \"I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,\" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue\u2014from sexuality to crime to immigration\u2014is discussed through \"a racial equity lens,\" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of \"divisive concepts\" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that \"members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also \"not limited\" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the \"1619\" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teaching multiple perspectives and the \"1619\" and \"1776\" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry. Students could read Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller \"How to Be an Antiracist\" alongside one of the many articles or books by writers like Messrs. Loury, McWhorter and Patterson. Kids would hear theories about \"systems of oppression,\" but they would also hear about the role that class and cultural differences play in disparity. In short, they would receive multiple narratives and explanations about why America is the way it is today and decide for themselves what to think and do about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my kids to get a good education. That means exposing them to ideas that some on the right want banned and other ideas that some on the left actively demonize. That's a true American education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bernstein is founder of the Jewish Institute for Liberal Values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teach '1619' and '1776' U.S. History</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By David Bernstein</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/2628908360.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>I reject both parties\u2019 ideas of Americanism. And I\u2019m not the only one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than two decades, I've tried to make sense of political currents in both parties, often to the consternation of readers on both sides. I've been called a corporatist and Republican apologist; more often, I'm called an elitist who pumps out Democratic talking points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all that time, I have not felt as utterly repulsed from the mainstream of both parties as I do right now. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job \u2014 a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich \u2014 who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote \u2014 that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did. For me (and probably a lot of suburbanites voting this fall), this is more than a backdrop to his presidency. It's a dealbreaker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their zeal to beat back Trumpism, the loudest Democratic groups have transformed into its Bizarro World imitators. Tossing aside ideals of equal opportunity and free expression, the new leftists obsess on identity as much as their adversaries do \u2014 but instead of trying to restore some obsolete notion of a White-dominated society, they seek vengeance under the guise of virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the bibles of this movement is a book called \"How to Be an Antiracist,\" in which Ibram X. Kendi declares: \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not \u2014 as the celebrated author claims \u2014 an expression of support for Lyndon B. Johnson-style <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which still makes sense to me. It is a case for the kind of social upheaval that occurred when foreign empires relinquished their colonies. It does not end well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals used to believe in civil debate about such ideas. But now, the arbiters of language are constantly issuing Soviet-style edicts about which terms are acceptable and which aren't (\"woke\" was okay, now it's not) \u2014 a tactic used for controlling the debate and delegitimizing critics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can disagree about whether this radical uprising is necessary or politically self-destructive. But it's clearly not in keeping with the principles that are supposed to unite the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was taught \u2014 and still believe \u2014 that in the United States, we are bound not by common origin, language or culture but by a series of laws and values that make us who we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as you swear allegiance to those laws and values \u2014 racial equality, free speech, unfettered worship \u2014 then you're no more or less American than anyone else, and no less deserving of respect, protection and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That we've failed to honor that promise over the life of the country, and are failing still, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and abandon the project. It means you rededicate yourself to the ideal of true equality, rather than reducing individuals to a box on a census form.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the ideology that both parties used to call liberalism. There is no longer room for it in today's stark political dichotomy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, it's a testimony to the damage that one shameless and unprincipled man managed to wreak on our politics. Trump always had a talent for bringing out the worst in everyone; more than a year after leaving office, he remains the decaying star by which everyone else in our political solar system must orient themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also the result of an antiquated primary system \u2014 at the presidential level and below \u2014 that plays to an ever-winnowing group of fervent believers in both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more people grow disgusted with extremist party politics, the more only those extremists are heard and the more power they exert on anyone who wants to run for higher office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is about the point where some (most likely some in my own business) will scream: \"Both sidesism!\" That's the now-cliche argument that any criticism of Democrats whatsoever must be some kind of journalistic reflex to equate the parties, when clearly one is worse than the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is worse than the other. But that doesn't mean we have to feel jazzed about supporting a party that would grade our worthiness as people on a sliding scale of identity. It doesn't change the fact that the broad center of the American electorate \u2014 traditional conservatives and liberals both \u2014 no longer has a political home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where do we go?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, I've predicted the eventual triumph of an independent president, outside the two-party system. That candidate hasn't emerged, but the lane for a credible independent has never been wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's also the probability that some reformist Democratic governor or political novice is looking at the political landscape and thinking that, if you could unify that liberal constituency inside the party, you might just be able to commandeer it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've never been very good at predicting the path ahead. What I do know is that politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum \u2014 and, one way or another, a force will arise to fill the space at the eye of our destructive political storm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until then, you can call me a dissenter.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women's March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn't. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While becoming the movement of Dinesh D'Souza, Sean Hannity and Franklin Graham, they have essentially expelled the leaders and thinkers who have purchase in mainstream culture. Conservatism is now less a political or philosophic movement and more a separatist subculture that participates in its own ostracism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, progressives are getting better and more aggressive at silencing dissenting behavior. All sorts of formerly legitimate opinions have now been deemed beyond the pale on elite campuses. Speakers have been disinvited and careers destroyed. The boundaries are being redrawn across society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Andrew Sullivan noted recently, \"workplace codes today read like campus speech codes of a few years ago.\" There are a number of formerly popular ideas that can now end your career: the belief that men and women have inherent psychological differences, the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, opposition to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's happening today is that certain ideas about gun rights, and maybe gun ownership itself, are being cast in the realm of the morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the importance of the corporate efforts to end N.R.A. affiliations. It's not about N.R.A. members saving some money when they fly. It's that they are not morally worthy of being among the affiliated groups. The idea is to stigmatize.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If progressives can cut what's left of the conservative movement off from mainstream society, they will fundamentally alter the culture war. We think of the culture war as this stagnant thing in which both sides scream at each other. But eventually there could be a winner. Progressives have won on most social issues. They could win on nearly everything else.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Continued school shootings could be just the thing that persuades the mainstream that conservatism is vulgar and socially illegitimate, somewhere between smoking and segregationism. If that kind of total victory is on offer for progressives, why should they take my advice and tone things down for the sake of a few small gun laws? The big prize here is not gun laws. It's winning the culture war, with the gunfight as the final battle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only thing I'd say to my progressive friends is, be careful how you win your victories. It is one thing to win by persuasion and another thing to win by elite cultural intimidation. Illiberalism breeds illiberalism. Using elite power, whether economic or cultural, to silence less educated foes usually produces a backlash.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have zero cultural power, but they have immense political power. Even today, voters trust Republicans on the gun issue more than Democrats. If you exile 40 percent of the country from respectable society they will mount a political backlash that will make Donald Trump look like Adlai Stevenson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}

He also told her not to bring any of those people to his games.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meaning NBA games, in which 8 in 10 players are African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daffy? Sick? Tawdry?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to Donald Sterling's world. It's all the loopier because the female in question is of mixed race and half a century younger than the doddering octogenarian, who is said to have set his friend up with a home near the Beverly Center and luxury cars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let this be a reminder to one and all: Never get tangled up with anyone 50 years younger because it can only end badly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Tolliver's clip parlor Monday, the day before Sterling was sentenced to eternal shame, the clientele was having a typically passionate, boisterous conversation on race, as Rosa Parks and Jackie Robinson looked on from their posters on the wall. It's been 67 years since Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball, 59 years since Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus, and just a few days since Sterling turned back the clock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's remarks, fresh on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests we're ready to move beyond <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, followed those by Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy on the good old days of cotton picking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He said we'd be better off as slaves,\" Tolliver said about Bundy. And then Sterling came along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolliver was particularly appalled by the part of the recording in which the man said to be Sterling talked about his players. \"He said, 'I buy their food, I buy their cars, I buy their houses. Like he's a slave owner,\" said Tolliver, who said he believes the players are nothing but tools to boost Sterling's already staggering fortune.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither Tolliver nor his customers were shocked by the revelations on the tape. They're well aware that the billionaire property owner once paid millions to settle a housing discrimination case, and he was sued unsuccessfully by onetime Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor, who said Sterling ran the Clipper operation like it was a plantation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What in the world, Tolliver demanded, had the NAACP been thinking with its plans to honor Sterling after he made a donation to the organization? The group changed its mind when the latest Sterling scandal broke, but Tolliver says Sterling's true colors were already known, and he suspects the owner's charitable donations are investments in image control rather than expressions of true compassion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The barbershop consensus was unanimous on two points:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, that the country has made much progress on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, that there's a long way to go, because Sterling is anything but a lone man on a tiny island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I've been hearing it all my life,\" said Warren Allen, a dentist and Vietnam vet. He said people frequently let loose around him -- with the N-word and more -- because he's light-skinned and they don't know he's African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Race-baiting is alive and well, said Bishop Curtis Gadson of Amazing Grace Outreach Ministries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We have people on television and talk radio scaring the hell out of people,\" Gadson said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bishop grew up in the South and recalls segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains. He moved to L.A. 50 years ago and knew immediately that it was a better place. But even now, he said, he sees white people eye him suspiciously depending on the time and place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A whole lot of it has changed, but a whole lot of it went underground, and when Obama became president it all came back out,\" said Ron Simmons, a church elder. \"They couldn't help themselves.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For him, Sterling's remarks deserved full condemnation. He was taken back to 1970, when he was bused from a black high school to an all-white school in Inglewood. The very first day, he recalled, demonstrators greeted their arrival, and one man waved a sign bearing racial epithets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You can't have a good barbershop conversation without a dissenting view, and in this case Drew Palmer took the challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's purported remarks were deplorable, said Palmer, an engineer and youth mentor. But he says he's more incensed by the casual use of the N-word in street talk and rap lyrics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why a firestorm over Sterling, he asked, and silence on the objectification of women and glorification of gangs in popular culture? Is it just about capitalism, same as it is for Sterling? And why compassion for millionaire ballplayers who aren't necessarily the best role models, but so little consideration of the working poor who couldn't afford to see a Clipper game even if Sterling allowed them into the building?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Palmer won some points, but no one in the room was about to give Donald Sterling a pass. Simmons, like Tolliver, saw a parallel with the winner of this year's best-picture Oscar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's like '12 Years a Slave,'\" he said. \"Just call it '12 Years a Clipper.'\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steve.lopez@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: SOUTH L.A.

University of Texas <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> case before the Supreme Court, amicus briefs by a group of leading researchers and by the American Educational Research Association show that research over all undermines the mismatch hypothesis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the undergraduate level, a large body of evidence shows that attending a more selective university is associated with net gains in African-Americans\u2019 and Latinos\u2019 graduation rates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What matters most is the cumulative weight of peer-reviewed social science research, and on that score the shortcomings of the mismatch hypothesis are conspicuously apparent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WILLIAM KIDDER Riverside, Calif., March 19, 2013</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer, assistant provost at the University of California, Riverside, has published several articles about mismatch.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We as a society have decided that college degrees from certain institutions are more valuable than others, and that the holders are best equipped to run the nation\u2019s economic, political and social life. Unless we decide that all college degrees confer the same access to power and influence, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is necessary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> conferring a stigma on minority students: The stigma would not exist if we held all students to the same academic requirements from primary school on, and if we financed the public schools equally, engaged all parents consistently and stopped assuming that racial heritage has a correlation with intellectual capacity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is disingenuous and offensive to call for an end to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> when we underfinance schools, fail to engage parents, establish two-track academic standards and traffic in racial stereotypes under the guise of education system analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ROSILAND JORDAN Washington, March 17, 2013</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racism is America\u2019s original sin. Until we put as many young blacks in colleges as we do in jail, we should be expanding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has flaws, the criteria for abolishing it should be that we first find a better solution to the problem of persistent racism, and implement it to the fullest extent possible. Only then, when we know that solution is working, do we consider abolishing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JANE McALEVEY Muir Beach, Calif., March 18, 2013</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mismatch theory begins with a set of assumptions based largely on test scores. Researchers have shown that test scores have more to do with the size of one\u2019s parents\u2019 checking account than intellectual capabilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Researchers also know that the institutional climate makes a considerable difference in students\u2019 ability to achieve \u2014 for example, a welcoming environment, the willingness of students to work collaboratively across racial and ethnic lines, transparent grading rubrics and the expectation that faculty members view every student as worthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So it is not surprising that historically black colleges have had great success with black students in producing physicians, lawyers and scientists of international fame, more so than historically elite and majority white schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>RANDAL MAURICE JELKS Lawrence, Kan., March 17, 2013</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an associate professor of American studies and African and African-American studies at the University of Kansas.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly against": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398441227.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Affirmative reaction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Court cases percolate all over America, but California has staked out political leadership of the drive to take the spoils out of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts there are occurring on three fronts -- at the University of California, in the legislature and through the initiative process. None, however, is assured of success.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who happens to be black and also a longtime friend of Gov. Pete Wilson, raised the issue of admissions quotas again last month, attracting considerable media attention. Mr. Connerly, who last year objected because some minority-group members apparently were \"admitted almost solely on the basis of race\" to the prestigious university's medical schools, this time widened his focus to the undergraduate enrollment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the June regents meeting, he asked administrators to consider alternatives to race-based admissions and to review federal laws and regulations that may constrain the UC. Mr. Connerly's direction, however, is clear: He doesn't like masked forms of \"government redistribution that takes from one and gives to another.\" He wants, instead, to \"market\" the university to groups that are underrepresented in the student body and assist them in preparing for application. As far as race and sex are concerned, that'd be it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Connerly makes his living as a consultant to public agencies and other entities, especially those concerned with land use, which is what brought him and Mr. Wilson together when they both worked in the statehouse two decades ago. He says he has never used minority set-asides to get contracts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Mr. Connerly's been a rather lonely voice on the regents. \"We need to put a little fiber in people who don't want to be perceived as racists or Uncle Toms,\" he says of his fellow board members, nearly all of them appointed by Republican governors. \"We're now at the point where the returns we're getting from this (preference policy) are little, but they come at a very high price.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That cost is the increasing bitterness of white and Asian-heritage students who find that merit isn't enough in what was long an objective process. On the other side, however, adamant defenders of quotas will spare nothing to defend their beachhead at the UC. In recent years, the legislature has passed mandates that the state universities admit in proportion with California's ethnic distribution. (They were vetoed.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legislative politics on this issue may be changing, as bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring and contracting now should get a fuller hearing. The main reason for this is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment flatly outlawing quotas that looms for the 1996 ballot. The legislature, still controlled by Democrats, may wish to pass statutes that steal some of the initiative's thunder while mucking up its succinct clarity with lots of lawyer-like language. Still, the citizen measure's sponsors are willing to go as far in the Capitol as they can.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, they will have to proceed to collect 615,000 valid signatures for a ballot placement next year. While many are predicting a polarizing and victorious campaign that will change the agenda of both state and national races, the fact is that backers face a daunting task. They will need about $1 million to qualify, and then will be up against an opposition including businesses that rely on quotas for their income.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By contrast, supporters are cash poor. Major corporations will sit this one out, fearing a public-relations hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story of the failed California voucher campaign of 1993 is a reminder of how an underfunded proposal is susceptible to an expensive campaign of harassment and distortion. On the other hand, Proposition 187 this past fall, despite its faults, proved that an inherently popular, grass-roots drive (with gubernatorial support) can win against loud opposition. The Civil Rights Initiative has going for it, at least so far, the quiet support of many moderate Democrats who grasp what the racial wedge is now doing to their party and their society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In sum, the California ferment stems from a bid to reclaim <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>'s original standing: It is a way to boost those who need help competing on what is, at the point of competition, a level field. It's an attempt to pull the idea back from its current emphasis on institutional mandates and return the focus to where it belongs -- on individual achievement.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 12s "}}
