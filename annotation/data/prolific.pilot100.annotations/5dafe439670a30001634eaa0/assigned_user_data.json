One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: \"I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do.\" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: \"If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics.

Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught \"collaborating\" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an \"oversight commissioner\" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught \"collaborating\" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an \"oversight commissioner\" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine.

Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits.

This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict.

Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities.

For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent.

This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason.

He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it.

Al \"The Mushroom\" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,\" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape.
