{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/420733639.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Chicago Way extension runs right through D.C.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Barack Obama must not have had his Hopium before appearing on \"The Tonight Show\" last week, because he really screwed up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, not the screw-up in which he abandoned his trusty teleprompter to ad-lib a joke about how he's such a lousy bowler, just like someone in the Special Olympics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Obama were a Republican, he'd be toast, since Republicans have been cast as unfeeling monsters in the two-dimensional cartoon that is American politics on TV. But Obama is a Democrat, beloved by the glassy-eyed media as a symbol of hope and change, even if guys from Chicago's City Hall run his administration. So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Stunned, stunned is the word,\" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, \"Gee, I dunno\" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal. Or that time that Daley gave $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts to men he knows well, yet was stunned to learn later that they were white guys, not black females.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These days, the Washington Way is looking just like the Chicago Way. Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, \"New subject, or else,\" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on \"The Simpsons,\" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just last month,\" Crowley told Geithner, \"AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,\" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"And there's more,\" Crowley said. \"Further bonus payments totaling approximately $230 million are due to 407 participants at AIG's Financial Products division in March 2010. This makes no sense to my constituency.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sadly, it makes perfect sense back here, where we get only that  weak schwag Hopium. They cut the deal in some back room, and Geithner is being measured as the fall guy. It sounds just like Chicago's City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm stunned, really.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned is the word.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Photo: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who testified on Capitol Hill this month, knew all about the millions in bonuses for American International Group Inc. executives weeks ago.

When asked in March 2002 why he rarely mentioned Osama bin Laden anymore, which three of these statements did Mr. Bush make?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Osama who?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I know he is on the run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) I truly am not that concerned about him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) He's just another one of the dead-enders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) We haven't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. When Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Kerry about a report that Mr. Bush's I.Q. was higher than his, how did he respond?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) But he doesn't even speak French.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I've never misunderestimated his intelligence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) That's great. More power.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) This just shows, once again, that the president has been deliberately hiding the truth from the American public.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) It's a great boost in our campaign to connect with voters who are still trying to figure out which candidate to support. I mean, these folks are obviously not Mensa material.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. How did President Bush propose to save Social Security?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Raise the retirement age to 90.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Impose an excise tax on cruise-ship fares and early-bird-special meals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Encourage the exportation of Medicare recipients to Canada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Allow young workers to invest contributions in private savings accounts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Deny flu shots to senior citizens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. A Kerry commercial titled ''January Surprise'' warns that ''Bush has a plan to cut Social Security benefits by 30 to 45 percent.'' The campaign bases this on one of several options proposed by a bipartisan commission, but not endorsed by Mr. Bush, to peg future benefit increases to consumer prices instead of wages.

Last week Mr. Kerry criticized Mr. Bush over the disappearance of explosives from a site in Iraq. What is the name of the site?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Al Qaeda</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Al Dente</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Al Qaqaa</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Al Qaselzur</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Al Roker</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>8. In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen. What was the most common response?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) It swayed me to vote for the celebrity's candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) It swayed me to vote for the other candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>9. In the same survey, respondents were asked to name the celebrity whose endorsement was least likely to make them vote for a presidential candidate. Here are the four names mentioned the most often. Place them in order, starting with the celebrity least likely to sway anyone's vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Martha Stewart.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) O.J. Simpson</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Paris Hilton</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Mike Tyson</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>10. What phrase did the Kerry campaign use to describe the coalition assembled by President Bush in Operation Iraqi Freedom?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A coalition of the coerced and the bribed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A bunch of yo-yos.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) The unspeakable in search of the incredible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) The gang that couldn't shoot straight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) N.O.C.D. (Not our class, dear).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>11. During the second presidential debate, what position did Mr. Bush say he would find unacceptable in a Supreme Court justice?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Pro-euthanasia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Pro-abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Pro-fluoridation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Pro-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Pro-slavery.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>12. When asked by Bob Woodward if he had consulted with his father about the decision to invade Iraq, what did President Bush say?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Wouldn't have been prudent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) I would have if he'd won a second term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) He is the wrong father to appeal to in terms of strength. There is a higher father that I appeal to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Just because someone has defeated Saddam Hussein once doesn't make him an expert.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) I tried, but he was stuck on this notion that it would take a lot of troops.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>13. What new strategy is the Kerry campaign planning for Ohio on Tuesday?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Carrying voters to the polls in sedan chairs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Posting security guards along Lake Erie to prevent Mr. Kerry from windsurfing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Promising toasters to the first 10 voters at each polling place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Employing a ''snack czar'' to hand out food to voters in line.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Assigning each voter a ''personal lawyer.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>14. According to The Associated Press, a Democratic politician campaigning for Mr. Kerry in Florida declared, ''If we were living in another country and we had the president of the country and his brother controlling one of the biggest provinces or states, we would ... have some doubts about whether, given their track record, they really believe in democracy.'' Who said it?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) A former vice president and senator whose father was a senator.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) A senator of a populous state whose brothers served simultaneously as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) A congressman who is the son of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) A former cabinet official whose father was governor of one of the biggest states and who married the niece of the senator whose brothers served as president and attorney general.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) A senator elected in one of the biggest states while her husband was president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>15.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408580425.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Colorblind Conservatives?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I suppose it's easier to get engrossed in a subplot when the main story line has become fairly obvious. Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is \"no,\" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the \"religious right\"--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 7s "}}

We used to be roommates long ago, and she's finally marrying her partner of 10 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When she told me she was getting married, she did all the usual things that people who are about to be married do. She showed me a picture of her dress, and we talked about the kind of cake they were going to get. In the end, she and her partner decided they'd have a quick wedding in Las Vegas and then do another, more formal ceremony back east in the city where we live. That's this evening, and I'm happy for both of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I used the word \"partner\" in an attempt to be intentionally vague. But I'll tell you now that the bride is a cisgender woman. Her husband is a cisgender man. In short, it's the kind of wedding that conservatives believe is the only kind of wedding that counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's a more complex aspect to their nuptials. She is bisexual and proudly so. It just so happens that she fell in love with a man. She has had many relationships with women. Had she fallen in love with a woman, it's quite possible that the seamstress could have refused to alter her dress, the bakery could have refused to make her a cake. But she avoided all of that by marrying a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Supreme Court has been very busy lately making clear which kinds of people it truly values. By striking down Roe v. Wade, the justices showed us how much they value the opinions of women who want a say in their own health care. By striking down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, they showed us how much they value White over Black and Brown students. By striking down student loan forgiveness, they demonstrated how much they value those who don't have enough money to avoid the Ponzi scheme called student loans. And today they essentially legalized the unequal treatment of LGBTQ people by holding that discrimination is a small price to pay if it lifts up just one kind of love.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Supreme Court has become a conservative dreamland: Out of touch with the country and determined to satisfy conservatives who think they win only when someone else loses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lorie Smith, the Colorado web designer who refuses to make websites for LGBTQ people, may experience a boom in her business. This legal action was the best thing she could have done to make that happen. I don't know if she's a particularly good web designer or not, but I do know she will be lionized in some circles because she helped make people who conservatives don't like suffer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This need by conservatives is not about faith, really. It's about ensuring that Americans they don't know and don't like will suffer. They consider it a win for White people when Black and Brown people suffer. A win for men when women suffer. A win for older, richer people when younger, poorer people suffer. Everything in their minds is binary. We win. You lose. Black and white. And our current Supreme Court has become the favored weapon in their arsenal to bring about heartache for those they don't like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it won't end here. Because whatever lines the justices may think they have carefully drawn during this term, their benefactors in the deep conservative world are just getting warmed up. Get ready for more: More behavior on your part that they will essentially outlaw. More things we're not allowed to teach. More roads for access unceremoniously cut off. More rights trampled on, and more barriers to discrimination lowered. Because the main priority of our conservative Supreme Court is to keep the status quo secure. Solid. And that means keeping certain people down.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, I will go to my friend's wedding in a few hours.

I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would \"enforce the law fairly\" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws \"fairly\"? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and \"crack\" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll \"enforce the law.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>) \"limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 41s "}}

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,\" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,\" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The court operates according to a different rule,\" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. \"There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,\" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. \"He may still be finding things out himself.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's \"median voter,\" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, \"the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 37s "}}

Eurocentric Americans who oppose reparations for historically oppressed groups can count this new census data as a victory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not \"beat around the (George) bush\" by pretending that this transparent attempt to pass off racism as multicultural acceptance is a good thing for American society. These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered \"white\" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such.

Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages? Do \"blacks\" have to have a close white relative, be raised by one, or simply embrace everyone who has contributed to their genetic makeup in order to qualify for the \"white-black\" box?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of clarity on this question makes the data collected invalid for the purpose of drawing conclusions.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word \"integrity.\" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the \"integrity\" or \"legitimacy\" or \"reputation\" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was \"trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington.\" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for \"a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.\" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts \"been just an associate justice, and not the chief\" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a \"strike\" was changed to a \"ball\" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: \"Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: \"By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning \"sufficient political capital\" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 34s "}}

That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like \"violence never settles anything\" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word \"never.\" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, \"Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer.\" Goldberg responds, \"So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?\" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like \"Diversity is strength,\" either. (\"Cool,\" he writes. \"The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!\") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\" Sure, he writes, \"if the other man is an idiot.\" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"We don't solve problems by throwing money at them.\" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.\" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare.\" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left.\" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"America: Love It Or Leave It.\" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?\" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, \"Reality has a liberal bias.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong \u2014 the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard\u2019s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard\u2019s tenured professors are white \u2014 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and most recently \u201ckung flu.\u201d Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never \u201cleveled the playing field,\u201d but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly in favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 17s "}}
