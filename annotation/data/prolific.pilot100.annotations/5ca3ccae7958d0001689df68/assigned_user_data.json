Universities use many factors in admissions. How did he know his client was turned down for being white? When he replied that race simply could never be used, Justice O'Connor said tartly, ''You have some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with.'' Moments later, she added, ''You are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There could have been little doubt among the spectators packed into the Supreme Court last Tuesday that history was being made. Outside, thousands of protesters marched with signs proclaiming ''Equal Opportunity for All,'' and, in the case of one young marcher, a photo of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School. The conservative Center for Individual Rights, which is backing the plaintiffs, spoke of the day being ''Affirmative Action's Alamo.'' The two cases against the University of Michigan -- one against its undergraduate program, the other against its law school -- came to the Supreme Court with five years of momentum. But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>'s unlikely savior.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses.

But she owes her place on the court not only to her immense talent and drive, but also to a governmental act -- in her case, by President Reagan -- that can only be called <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. In the end, Justice O'Connor may take a close look at the hard-working, bright University of Michigan applicants who get a few extra points on their applications because they are minorities -- and see herself.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Why Justice O'Connor Could Be Affirmative Action's Unlikely Savior</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kirk Kolbo was just about to tell the Supreme Court that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> violates the Constitution when Sandra Day O'Connor cut him off. Universities use many factors in admissions. How did he know his client was turned down for being white? When he replied that race simply could never be used, Justice O'Connor said tartly, ''You have some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with.'' Moments later, she added, ''You are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There could have been little doubt among the spectators packed into the Supreme Court last Tuesday that history was being made. Outside, thousands of protesters marched with signs proclaiming ''Equal Opportunity for All,'' and, in the case of one young marcher, a photo of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School. The conservative Center for Individual Rights, which is backing the plaintiffs, spoke of the day being ''Affirmative Action's Alamo.'' The two cases against the University of Michigan -- one against its undergraduate program, the other against its law school -- came to the Supreme Court with five years of momentum. But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>'s unlikely savior.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses. Justice O'Connor, who asked at argument what impact California's anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> referendum has had on law schools there, is likely to worry about this real-world impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is Justice O'Connor's inclination to look for herself in the litigants who appear before her.

They include practical ones, such as the difficulty of divesting fully when portfolios contain index funds, hedge funds and other complex instruments; concerns about adverse effects on the ability of endowments to support education and research as fully as they could if they were unconstrained; and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about changes (which are often unspecified) in corporate practice.

Of course, one can do both, but one wonders how often that happens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, these are times when educational institutions need to work harder, in my view, to improve educational outcomes, especially for less-privileged students.

At the institutional level, there are only so many dollars to spend, and only so many hours in the day to work on issues of consequence. Well- intentioned but poorly conceived efforts to compel colleges and universities to fight extramural battles of all kinds can impair efforts to work harder on issues of great social as well as educational consequence that are at the core of the basic educational mission of higher education.

Both parties are responsible for the escalating warfare over judicial nominations, which is now on the verge of blowing up the Senate, as Republicans prepare to eliminate the filibuster and Democrats prepare to retaliate by bringing other Senate business to a halt. This self-destruction would cap a decade of attacks on judges by both parties. In 2003, for example, Congress passed a law requiring that every time a federal judge reduces a sentence, the judge's name should be reported to Congress. \"The game is over for judges,\" announced Sen.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were no judicial memoirs, in the modern sense. The first justice to present himself as a celebrity was William O.

This never gets easier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced Wednesday that one police officer would be charged, not in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, but with endangering her neighbors with reckless gunfire. \"If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice,\" Mr. Cameron said, in an apparent attempt to explain the lack of more serious charges relating to the 26-year-old's killing. \"Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cameron's use of the term \"mob justice\" to characterize protests by African-Americans who want officers who kill Black people with seeming impunity held responsible for their actions is curious phrasing, particularly from an attorney general from a Southern state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mob justice was literally used by Kentucky and other Southern states for decades to rule over Black people. Lynching and other racial terror tactics were deployed frequently, often with the help of the criminal justice system. Authorities were known to hand Black people to mobs who turned violence and spectacle into regional events. The news of an impending lynching would bring Southern white families to town squares on foot and by wagon.

This represented repeated failures of the criminal justice system. This was a willful shunning of the nation's basic principles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All Ms. Taylor's family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we're so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted.

Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. It's painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman's home late at night will face no consequences.

On its face, she appears to have a strong case. University admissions guidelines seem to instruct admissions officers to handle minority applications differently from those of white applicants, laying out a dual set of standards that could raise a constitutional problem under the Supreme Court's 1978 case University of California Regents v. Bakke. In Bakke, the court allowed race to be a factor in admissions but said it could not preclude any candidate from receiving full consideration. That is precisely what Ms. Gratz alleges happened to her, because the guidelines suggest that comparably qualified minority candidates generally should be admitted. These are disturbing guidelines, and it is significant that the university has since changed its admissions system to one that would be easier to defend under Bakke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, it would be premature to pass judgment on a complex admissions system before all the evidence is in. It is difficult to demonstrate that any one student was rejected because of race as opposed to the myriad other factors that influence admissions at a large university, and the University of Michigan gives preferential treatment to students on bases other than race. Students from certain counties in Michigan get preferential treatment, for example, as do students whose parents are Michigan alumni. It is not logical to suggest that race can be a factor in admissions but can never play a decisive role in an individual admissions decision. Even a program that meets the Bakke test, in other words, is going to produce certain white victims -- like, perhaps, Ms. Gratz -- so the mere fact that such victims exist cannot necessarily mean that the program is constitutionally deficient.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The larger question, of course, is whether Bakke even remains the law of the land. Normally, the courts wait for the Supreme Court to renounce one of its own rulings before declaring the ruling dead.
