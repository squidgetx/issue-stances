{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409129544.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Bush's Political Smarts</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several less than fully flattering reasons one can point to for the steady and large gains in public opinion made by President Bush: (1) He benefits from surpassing exceedingly low expectations; (2) he benefits from surpassing an exceedingly low predecessor; (3) he benefits from an easy and shallow charm, which is useful in winning over an easy and shallow press corps; and (4) he possesses the narrow mind's narrow focus, which naturally concentrates his administration's energies and the public's attention on the priorities of his agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is true, but there is more to Bush's good times. There is, of all things, intelligence. Bush is, on one level, no toy rocket scientist. \"Is our children learning?\" he asked during the campaign. Oh, they is, but not, we hope, grammar from you, sir. As it happens, the level on which Bush is not intellectually impressive is the only one that most journalists respect: verbal intelligence, the ability to understand and manipulate logic and language. This is precisely the sort of intelligence Bush does not possess, and so, many journalists stupidly thought of Bush as, well, stupid. I include myself in this and hereby renounce and regret my repeated past use, in connection with Bush, of the word \"pinhead.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bush does possess is political intelligence -- the ability to understand and manipulate people and situations. Verbal intelligence and political intelligence are not necessarily connected: Think of the Mayor Daleys, father and son. It appears that this is so with Bush. The best evidence of this is that he has shown a grasp of the same essential dynamic of politics that brought success to his immediate predecessor -- the dynamic of triangulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bill Clinton knew and what it seems Bush knows is that there are three groups of voters: a core who will vote for you if, and only if, you satisfy their nonnegotiable ideological demands; a contrapuntal anti-core, whom you can never win over but whom you may discourage; and swing voters. To win, you must satisfy the core, blunt the drive and reach of the anti-core and make yourself minimally acceptable to a majority of the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obvious, of course, but in practice, not so. Clinton brilliantly grasped the subtleties of the thing. He understood that (a) the core's nonnegotiable needs were actually very few; meet those needs absolutely and always and the core would grant you vast leeway on every other issue; (b) the post-'60s Democratic Party, forgetting this, had assumed all sorts of demands to be nonnegotiable and had thereby saddled itself with all sorts of unpopular positions (in areas such as welfare, crime and use of military force); thus (c) making it impossible for it to win a majority of the swing. So Clinton made himself the unwavering champion of his core's nonnegotiables (<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, unfettered abortion, identity group representation in the distribution of power and perks). Everything else he threw up for grabs, and in the process threw away all the bad old issues that kept Democrats marginalized, and won back the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush is now doing the same thing in reverse. Like Clinton, Bush knows that he must satisfy his core's nonnegotiables; he has moved unwaveringly to do this, most importantly on abortion and on taxes. Like Clinton, he knows that most of the swings want a nondivisive, \"nice\" president, and that giving ground on contentious issues will please the swing, weaken the standing of the anti-core and be tolerated by the core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Bush's support for an end to racial profiling in law enforcement. The core might regard that as giving in to race demagoguery, but it doesn't regard this as a nonnegotiable. To Bush's anti-core, though, racial profiling is a vital concern -- in fact, a nonnegotiable. The swings, meanwhile, just don't want to waste time and energy fighting about the thing. Thus, with one move, Bush's administration weakened its anti-core, which is depending heavily on selling the canard of Bush as a racist president, and pleased the swing, while not losing the slightest support with its core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is politics played on a high and nuanced plane of intelligence, the sort of level that signifies a natural ability -- natural political smarts. George W. Bush: smart guy.

Education Today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of diversity has taken on new meaning since Sept. 11.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suddenly from a nation of atomized individuals we became a collective, in fear, mourning and awareness of having a common identity and perhaps a common fate as Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that collective it suddenly seemed very important that we had many kinds of names and faces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of us began seeing faces we hadn't noticed before. Non- Muslims became aware of Muslims as people to be encountered in an emotional, almost intimate way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On college campuses students began flocking to classes on topics most hadn't much cared about before: Afghanistan, the Middle East, international relations, Islam, Arabic language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most important, Americans, in looking in each other's faces and hearing each other's prayers, sought a renewed faith that differences of color or religion or ethnic background don't have to lead to implacable enmity and mutual destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context it is worth reconsidering the venerable arguments about whether furthering diversity on college campuses constitutes a compelling national interest to the extent that universities should consider race and ethnicity in their admissions policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A series of conflicting court decisions in the last year have brought the debate over what is called the \"diversity rationale\" to a fever pitch, and the U.S. Supreme Court may have the final say. Different federal judges have ruled that race-conscious admissions policies are permissible to foster diversity for University of Michigan undergraduates, but not at the law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other jurists have decided that such policies are fitting at the University of Washington law school, but not for undergraduates at the University of Georgia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Implementation of such policies is different at each school, and the varied techniques may have played some part in the decisions. But the arguments on both sides always come back to the issue of whether diversity is a compelling enough interest to warrant going beyond tests and numbers in the direction of race and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The diversity rationale has taken the place of another accepted standard--remedying vestiges of past racial discrimination--because past bias is hard to pin down, especially outside the South. Diversity as a positive educational goal, beneficial to all students in an institution, makes a more compelling case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is of immediate importance only in flagship public universities throughout the country, as other state schools generally admit the vast majority of applicants. Private schools, however, might be held to whatever standard is finally applied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going to the right college, or to a top law or business or medical school, means a lot in this country. Not everything, fortunately, but still a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to insist that merit, determined by the test scores and grades, should be the only admission standard. We are all equal before the numbers, which are blind to color, gender and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But merit obviously takes many forms, and numbers themselves can be relative. Is a 1300 SAT score by a New Trier student from a wealthy family really more meritorious than an 1100 by a low-income teenager from the South Side?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clearly there is some lower limit on capability: Students must be able to do the work. And some studies show comparatively high dropout rates for students admitted to selective schools through <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there also is evidence that such students actually do better at top schools than their counterparts (for instance, black students with similar test scores) at less-selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crucial question is whether, in a world in which pluralistic values suddenly seem so important, the top schools can afford to cut minority admissions. One landmark study says a race-blind policy could slice the number of black students at these schools to as little as a quarter of the current total.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor said in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that she has given the issue a lot of thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"How does one see that we're not all the same, that we haven't traveled the same path and that we have to be able to see the world from the other person's eyes? That for me is at the center of why I believe so firmly that higher education has to be diverse,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't naturally come to see other sides; we need to learn how to do that, we need to have the social context and the learning context where we can get outside of ourselves.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after Sept. 11, students felt vulnerable and wanted to reach out to others without quite knowing how, she added. And of course there were ugly incidents, including a brawl in a campus bar after an attack on an Indian student.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"What I keep saying at events here is that it's terribly important in a crisis to see people as individuals and not as groups, not as a religion,\" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"For many of our students, college life is the first time they actually have a chance to live and work in a diverse environment.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of the diversity rationale say you can have stimulating, diverse ideas without a diverse student body. Not so. There is no substitute for that direct encounter with someone whose difference is a challenge to the heart and mind.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly in favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 19s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/399053714.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Conservatism and the University Curriculum</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political science departments at elite private universities such as Harvard and Yale, at leading small liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore and Williams, and at distinguished large public universities like the University of Maryland and the University of California, Berkeley, offer undergraduates a variety of courses on a range of topics. But one topic the undergraduates at these institutions -- and at the vast majority of other universities and colleges -- are unlikely to find covered is conservatism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no legitimate intellectual justification for this omission. The exclusion of conservative ideas from the curriculum contravenes the requirements of a liberal education and an objective study of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political science departments are generally divided into the subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. Conservative ideas are relevant in all four, but the obvious areas within the political science discipline to teach about the great tradition of conservative ideas and thinkers are American politics and political theory. That rarely happens today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, a political science department may feature a course on American political thought that includes a few papers from \"The Federalist\" and some chapters from Alexis de Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most students will hear next to nothing about the conservative tradition in American politics that stretches from John Adams to Theodore Roosevelt to William F. Buckley Jr. to Milton Friedman to Ronald Reagan. This tradition emphasizes moral and intellectual excellence, worries that democratic practices and egalitarian norms will threaten individual liberty, attends to the claims of religion and the role it can play in educating citizens for liberty, and provides both a vigorous defense of free-market capitalism and a powerful critique of capitalism's relentless overturning of established ways. It also recognized early that communism represented an implacable enemy of freedom. And for 30 years it has been animated by a fascinating quarrel between traditionalists, libertarians and neoconservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While ignoring conservatism, the political theory subfield regularly offers specialized courses in liberal theory and democratic theory; African-American political thought and feminist political theory; the social theory of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and the neo-Marxist Frankfurt school; and numerous versions of postmodern political theory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Students may encounter in various political theory courses an essay by the British historian and philosopher Michael Oakeshott, or a chapter from a book by the German-born American political philosopher Leo Strauss. But they will learn very little about the constellation of ideas and thinkers linked in many cases by a common concern with the dangers to liberty that stem from the excesses to which liberty and equality give rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That constellation begins to come into focus at the end of the 18th century with Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France.\" It draws on the conservative side of the liberal tradition, particularly Adam Smith and David Hume and includes Tocqueville's great writings on democracy and aristocracy and John Stuart Mill's classical liberalism. It gets new life in the years following World War II from Friedrich Hayek's seminal writings on liberty and limited government and Russell Kirk's reconstruction of traditionalist conservatism. And it is elevated by Michael Oakeshott's eloquent reflections on the pervasive tendency in modern politics to substitute abstract reason for experience and historical knowledge, and by Leo Strauss's deft explorations of the dependence of liberty on moral and intellectual virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without an introduction to the conservative tradition in America and the conservative dimensions of modern political philosophy, political science students are condemned to a substantially incomplete and seriously unbalanced knowledge of their subject. Courses on this tradition should be mandatory for students of politics; today they are not even an option at most American universities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When progressives, who dominate the academy, confront arguments about the need for the curriculum to give greater attention to conservative ideas, they often hear them as a demand for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Usually they mishear. Certainly <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for conservatives is a terrible idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political science departments should not seek out professors with conservative political opinions. Nor should they lower scholarly standards. That approach would embrace the very assumption that has corrupted liberal education: that to study and teach particular political ideas one's identity is more important than the breadth and depth of one's knowledge and the rigor of one's thinking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One need not be a Puritan to study and teach colonial American religious thought, an ancient Israelite to study and teach biblical thought, or a conservative or Republican to study and teach conservative ideas. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> in university hiring for political conservatives should be firmly rejected, certainly by conservatives and defenders of liberal education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, if political science departments were compelled to hire competent scholars to offer courses on conservative ideas and conservative thinkers, the result would be more faculty positions filled by political conservatives, since they and not progressives tend to take an interest in studying conservative thought. But there is no reason why scholars with progressive political opinions and who belong to the Democratic Party can not, out of a desire to understand American political history and modern political philosophy, study and teach conservatism in accordance with high intellectual standards. It would be good if they did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would also be good if every political science department offered a complementary course on the history of progressivism in America. This would discourage professors from conflating American political thought as a whole with progressivism, which they do in a variety of ways, starting with the questions they tend to ask and those they refuse to entertain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incorporating courses on conservatism in the curriculum may, as students graduate, disperse, and pursue their lives, yield the political benefit of an increase in mutual understanding between left and right. In this way, reforming the curriculum could diminish the polarization that afflicts our political and intellectual classes. But that benefit is admittedly distant and speculative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the near term, giving conservative ideas their due will have the concrete and immediate benefit of advancing liberal education's proper and commendable goal, which is the formation of free and well-furnished minds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Berkowitz is a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Peter Berkowitz</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 54s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409790149.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>It's The Law, Not the Judge; But These Days the Bench Is the Hot Seat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The response to the rulings in Terri Schiavo's case, following close after the murder of a state judge in Atlanta and a federal judge's family in Chicago, has put not only judicial opinions but judges themselves suddenly under the spotlight. The U.S. Marshals Service reports a \"dramatic increase\" in threats against federal judicial officials in recent years. And political attacks on judges seem to grow ever more vitriolic. The title of a best-selling new book makes its unsubtle point: \"Men in Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judges today are being catapulted into public view as personalities who seem fair game for attack rather than as anonymous oracles of the law. Part of the reason for this is the legalization of politics: Both liberals and conservatives are increasingly asking judges to decide issues  --  from the right to die to presidential elections  --  that politics are unable to resolve. As a result, when politicians and disappointed litigants don't like the result of a judicial decision, they feel emboldened to demand a new judge rather than accepting their defeat with good grace. This new personalization of the judiciary poses grave threats to the idea of judicial independence, which judges should try to resist by avoiding the spotlight rather than courting it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Schiavo case is the most dramatic illustration of this trend in which politicians try to cherry-pick judges who agree with them and attack those who do not. Judge George W. Greer, the circuit court judge who presided over the case in Pinellas County, Fla., has been vilified throughout the ordeal: Opponents picketed him, bombarded him with harassing letters and e-mails, and threatened to impeach or even kill him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The response of Congress and the president to his ruling was unprecedented: They attempted to select a judge more to their liking by passing a law directing federal courts to ignore Greer's findings and to reexamine the case. But two federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same legal conclusions as Greer. That suggests the law is clear. But what did the disappointed petitioners do? They denounced the judiciary in general: \"The judges are running this country,\" Schiavo's father, Robert Schindler, said Thursday afternoon outside the hospice where his daughter has received much of her care since she collapsed in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress has contributed mightily to this poisonous atmosphere. Both parties are responsible for the escalating warfare over judicial nominations, which is now on the verge of blowing up the Senate, as Republicans prepare to eliminate the filibuster and Democrats prepare to retaliate by bringing other Senate business to a halt. This self-destruction would cap a decade of attacks on judges by both parties. In 2003, for example, Congress passed a law requiring that every time a federal judge reduces a sentence, the judge's name should be reported to Congress. \"The game is over for judges,\" announced Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been at least nine periods in American history when Congress has tried to curb judicial independence, beginning with the Jeffersonian Republicans' attacks on the Marshall court. What makes the current wave of judge-bashing unusual is that virulently personal attacks now come from both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals routinely denounce such Supreme Court justices as Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as partisan conspirators, and they publish books with titles like \"Right Wing Justice: The Conservative Campaign to Take Over the Courts.\" And conservatives respond in kind. \"Some justices have been senile, racist, and crooked,\" Mark Levin, author of the conservative \"Men in Black,\" told the National Review Online. According to Levin, \"de facto judicial tyranny\" today \"frustrates and disenfranchises the American people and thwarts representative government.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to its intemperance, the accusation that judges are anti-democratic elitists is also flatly wrong. As Mark Tushnet of Georgetown University Law Center argues in a less popular but far more convincing new book, \"A Court Divided,\" the Rehnquist court has actually supported the views of a narrow majority of the American people, rather than thwarting them, in all the most controversial cases of the culture wars, involving <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay rights and access to early-term abortions. In the Schiavo case, too, polls show that a majority of Americans agreed with the federal judge's decision not to reinsert the feeding tube and strongly disagreed with Congress's effort to interfere in the legal battles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What can explain the odd gap between the political attacks on judges as tyrannical activists and the reality that, in most cases, for better or worse, they reflect the constitutional views of national majorities? The most obvious culprit: interest groups. Although judicial nominations are not a salient political issue for most of the country, they matter intensely to groups on the extreme left and right, who want to use the courts to achieve results they are unable to win at the ballot box. But there may be a political price to this pandering: President Bush and congressional Republicans have been placating their religious and social conservative base while alienating the rest of the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, judge bashing by the president and Congress creates an atmosphere of disrespect that encourages citizens to personalize the judiciary as well. In this more polarized, less hierarchical age, more people are proving unwilling to accept judicial decisions with which they disagree: If Congress can demand a new judge when it doesn't like the result of a case, why shouldn't a disappointed litigant, as well?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Journalists contribute to this personalization by emphasizing in stories about the courts, the political affiliation of federal judges and the presidents who appointed them. And even juries have succumbed to the pressures for personalization. Until the 1960s, jurors generally refused to talk to the press, reflecting the widespread convention that justice is blind; today, in high-profile trials, they have their own booking agents pitching them for the morning talk shows within moments after a verdict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But judges are not entirely powerless in the face of these relentless cultural and political forces. Their most effective defense is to follow the law as scrupulously as possible and not to be rattled by political pressures. \"All the judges have banded together to support Judge Greer,\" Schiavo's father lamented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's important, too, for judges not to be rattled by political attacks into grandiose assertions of judicial supremacy. When the Rehnquist Court, in reaffirming Roe v. Wade in 1992 and the case requiring cops to give Miranda warnings in 2000, asserted that it alone was entitled to interpret the Constitution, it exaggerated its own political importance in a way that invited further congressional attacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, to the greatest degree possible, judges should try to avoid the spotlight. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were no judicial memoirs, in the modern sense. The first justice to present himself as a celebrity was William O. Douglas, who published a largely fictionalized account of his Pacific Northwest boyhood in 1974. But Douglas's unfortunate example may have been a harbinger of things to come. Not long ago, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor appeared on the morning talk shows to promote her own autobiography of her Western girlhood. And Clarence Thomas recently sold a memoir for $1.5 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A better approach is that of William Rehnquist, who told C-SPAN that he always admired Robert E. Lee's refusal to write a memoir; the chief justice didn't think it appropriate for judges to reveal their personalities in public. Unlike some of his colleagues, Rehnquist understands that ill-advised exercises in self-revelation only encourage citizens and politicians to respond to judges in personal terms. At the vmoment, the judiciary is the last branch of American government that has largely resisted the strong public pressures on officials to bare their emotions and personalities in public. And in our violently polarized age of celebrity, judges will encourage the personalization of justice at their own peril.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Rosen is a law professor at George Washington University and legal affairs editor of the New Republic.

Universities use many factors in admissions. How did he know his client was turned down for being white? When he replied that race simply could never be used, Justice O'Connor said tartly, ''You have some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with.'' Moments later, she added, ''You are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There could have been little doubt among the spectators packed into the Supreme Court last Tuesday that history was being made. Outside, thousands of protesters marched with signs proclaiming ''Equal Opportunity for All,'' and, in the case of one young marcher, a photo of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School. The conservative Center for Individual Rights, which is backing the plaintiffs, spoke of the day being ''Affirmative Action's Alamo.'' The two cases against the University of Michigan -- one against its undergraduate program, the other against its law school -- came to the Supreme Court with five years of momentum. But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>'s unlikely savior.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses. Justice O'Connor, who asked at argument what impact California's anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> referendum has had on law schools there, is likely to worry about this real-world impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is Justice O'Connor's inclination to look for herself in the litigants who appear before her. On the surface, Justice O'Connor may seem like the white plaintiffs in these cases. But she owes her place on the court not only to her immense talent and drive, but also to a governmental act -- in her case, by President Reagan -- that can only be called <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. In the end, Justice O'Connor may take a close look at the hard-working, bright University of Michigan applicants who get a few extra points on their applications because they are minorities -- and see herself.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 51s "}}

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, \"America in Black and White,\" Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 9s "}}

Buckley Jr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A battle for the soul of the Democratic Party has broken out, pitting a predominantly liberal field of presidential hopefuls against moderate party leaders and political strategists. While Howard Dean and John Kerry have been stirring up crowds plainly eager to have at President Bush, Democratic officials have been trying to tamp the fervor down, warning that ''extremists'' will take the party back to the dark ages of 1972 and 1984.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, with Mr. Bush looking formidable and the Republicans in control of Congress, the urge toward moderation may seem sensible. But it ignores a glaring fact: Republicans have repeatedly won elections in recent decades largely by taking the opposite approach: giving free rein to their raucous base and choosing candidates who excite the party's rank and file. And isn't that, after all, what political parties are supposed to do?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, none of the top Democratic contenders are truly radical. Mr. Kerry, who happens to be the wealthiest member of the Senate, perhaps went overboard when he read aloud the pay packages of several business executives at an A.F.L.-C.I.O. event the other day. But if he's an extremist, so was Franlin D. Roosevelt, who railed against ''unscrupulous money changers'' in 1933. And to exaggerate the threat of an imminent ''far left'' takeover of the party -- as Senator Evan Bayh, head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, recently did -- really implies a repudiation of much of the party's traditional beliefs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides, it is not at all clear that far-left ideology was the cause of past Democratic defeats -- or that ideology plays a truly decisive role in presidential elections. While political strategists and pundits tend think in terms of sharply delineated issues, most voters do not. ''The American Voter,'' the landmark study by University of Michigan researchers published in 1960 and still a very useful guide to its subject, found that only one-fourth of the electorate held a clear opinion on most issues and identified those positions with one party or the other. A mere 2 percent could be classified as holding a consistently ''ideological'' position on overall policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to judge from recent elections, little has changed. In the 1980's the public supported the anti-Soviet, anti-government views of Ronald Reagan. In the 1990's the same public favored the globalist, pro-government politics of Bill Clinton. And neither president was held to the bar of consistency, whether it was the conservative Mr. Reagan creating huge deficits or the liberal Mr. Clinton dismantling welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, too, with President Bush, who now seems a small-government conservative (tax cuts for the rich), now a big-government liberal (prescription drug benefits), now a social liberal (favoring some types of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>), now a social conservative (opposed to gay marriage).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if abstract ideology plays a limited role in presidential races, the importance of ideologues and extremists -- that is, of people who cling to strong beliefs -- can't be overstated. It is they who bring passion and energy to politics, as Dr. Dean's Web-linked legions are now doing. Without these ''radicals,'' parties can lose their way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican establishment learned this lesson almost despite itself in the 1964 election. Democrats would do well to study that campaign, too, since its circumstances were remarkably similar to those unfolding today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back then, of course, the positions were reversed. A strong Democratic incumbent, Lyndon Johnson, was buoyed by a national crisis that rallied the public behind him: the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Republican Party chieftains, facing almost certain defeat, wanted to anoint a moderate candidate like Nelson Rockefeller or William Scranton, who could at least make a respectable showing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the party rank and file, tired of me-too politics and demanding ''a choice, not an echo,'' ardently backed the conservative Barry Goldwater. Party moderates, sounding just like today's worried Democrats, warned that Goldwater was an extremist whose nomination might marginalize the party for decades to come. They mounted a last-minute offensive to stop him, but Goldwater squeaked through, shocking his adversaries (and thrilling his followers) when he declared in his acceptance speech: ''Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.'' After that, most agreed, he was finished. And indeed he was trounced by Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for Republicans this was not the devastating setback it appeared. On the contrary, it was the crucial first step toward a historic victory. Goldwater's ''extremism'' turned out, on closer inspection, to be a form of idealism that revitalized the conservative movement in the years ahead. Youthful veterans of the Goldwater movement -- including Lee Edwards of the Heritage Foundation and Howard Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus -- help set a new policy agenda. Richard Viguerie, a member of the pro-Goldwater group Young Americans for Freedom, became an innovative fund-raiser. Patrick Buchanan, another Goldwaterite, helped formulate the more conservative components of Richard Nixon's agenda as a White House speechwriter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time the party shed its ''me too'' approach and developed a more sophisticated ideological style, which culminated in Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory. Today it is Lyndon Johnson's big-government heirs whom centrist Democrats say are on the fringes, while the Goldwater-influenced conservatives plausibly claim to occupy the mainstream.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party would never again underestimate the uses of zeal and continues to exploit it. In fact, even as the Democratic Leadership Council sounded its alarm in Philadelphia, some 1,000 young right-wing firebrands assembled at the Republican college convention in Washington. They excitedly discussed Ann Coulter's new book ''Treason,'' which depicts liberals as the enemy within, and heard from a prominent lobbyist who described Democrats as ''the ascension of evil, the bad guys, the Bolsheviks.'' Other highlights were speeches by Tom DeLay, the vociferous House majority leader, and Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political maestro, who looked delighted by the enthusiasm of these extremists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our two major parties seem to have swapped identities. The Republican establishment, presumably allied with the rich and privileged, embraces its populist core of hard-edged activists, while the Democratic elite, supposed champions of ''the people,'' evidently fears them. Only one party has learned the lesson of 1964 -- that extremists should not be lectured to but listened to, because they may have something important to say.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 31s "}}

Rather, it tries to achieve a different apportionment of existing opportunities. It's the classic zero sum game.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> does not reduce the disparities between those at the top and everyone else. It effectively accepts those disparities and looks instead at whether the racial, ethnic and gender makeup of the people who hold coveted positions fairly reflects the makeup of society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is different from traditional redistributive programs, most of which involve spending sums of money. With the old-fashioned programs, you can split differences with relative ease. If we're arguing about how much money to spend to help the handicapped, the unemployed, the elderly or the very poor, you and I might propose different amounts. It's not so hard to agree on a number in between, or to compromise on how the taxes to pay for such programs should be apportioned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But you can't split differences so easily with <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, because by definition it's applied to each individual job or college spot. Either you get it, or the other guy (or woman) gets it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the older redistributive programs defined groups not in terms of who they were (African Americans, women, Latinos), but rather by what their condition was (for example, orphans, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick, students in need of scholarships). Anyone -- of either gender, of any color, of any ethnic group -- might fall into the second set of categories. Programs for the poor or the unemployed may well set off fights between the lucky and the unlucky, the rich and the not-so-rich. But these are not fixed categories. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, on the other hand, rests on fixed definitions of which group you belong to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the above might be taken as an argument against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. If one's central concern is for a more equitable society, it would seem to make sense to direct government-backed efforts not toward entire racial or gender groups but toward all those, no matter what group they belong to, who need the most help. Surely, for example, it makes more sense to direct resources and preferences to impoverished inner-city kids and not to the sons and daughters of the well-off in the black community. And it doesn't seem to make sense to give, say, the daughter of the president of a steel company a preference over the son of a white janitor at the same steel company. Cases like that may not be typical, but they are relevant to the issue of whether <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is always just.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But matters do not stop there. The reason this issue is so hard was summarized by the sociologist Steven Lukes in a brilliant adage. \"Every way of seeing,\" he once wrote, \"is also a way of not seeing.\" So, for example, if you focus only on the injustices of class, you might well miss the injustices of race or gender. It is perfectly reasonable for an African American, even an affluent African American, to argue that the burden of discrimination he or she faces is qualitatively different from what might be faced by the white janitor's son. After all, the United States has been firmly committed by law to racial equality for only 31 of the 208 years that have passed since the adoption of a Constitution that permitted slavery. There is, to put it mildly, a lot of catching up to do, and the country clearly has an interest in making sure that African Americans have a good chance of inclusion at all levels of society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Glazer, a sociologist who has been one of the most articulate opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, surprised many with an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal last week warning that simply wiping out <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> could have disastrous consequences. \"I am concerned,\" he wrote, \"that African-Americans will see the abandonment of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for them as a terrible rejection by an indifferent and hostile society.\" Would they be entirely wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the coming <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> debate is to be something other than demagogic, each side needs to honor the other's truths. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> need to recognize that the standard they espouse, \"equality of opportunity,\" is not nearly as simple as it sounds. Guaranteeing equality of opportunity as between a very poor African American in the inner city and a well-off white suburbanite is a very big commitment involving all sorts of interventions (from prenatal care to adequate policing to decent schools). If you're for equality of opportunity, you have to be in favor of doing a lot more than is now being done to achieve it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have to understand its limits. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is doing very little to help those inner-city kids whose problems are now the largest cause of racial inequality. And supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should not write off as racism or sexism the concerns that whites of modest means have over what <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> might do to their children's chances of advancement. Such concerns are rooted in rational worries about economic conditions that may make their kids' way harder than it would have been 30 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton is thinking about naming a blue-ribbon commission to study <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. If the commission is going to hand out a moralistic report telling us all how to think, it shouldn't waste its time. But if it sees its job as broadening the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> debate to a discussion of how to ensure something closer to equality of opportunity -- for an inner- city child and that white janitor's son alike -- it might do some good.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 18s "}}
