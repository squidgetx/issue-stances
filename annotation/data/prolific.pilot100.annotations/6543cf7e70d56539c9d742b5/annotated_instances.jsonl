A greater proportion of white women than black women, however, participated in managerial and professional training.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout most of the 1970s, black women who participated in job training programs tended to be disproportionately represented in clerical and semiskilled programs. They were consequently underrepresented in managerial and professional training programs. Our study results revealed, however, that participation in job training programs among black women eroded throughout the 1980s. As this cohort aged, black women participated less than white women in training programs. Despite this decline, however, we found no differences by type of training among participants in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, our results pointed to good and bad news regarding women's participation in job training programs throughout a significant portion of their paid working histories. On one hand, job training segregation characteristic of the 1970s evaporated in the 1980s, as black women and white women were equally as likely to participate in clerical and semiskilled programs as they were in managerial and professional programs. On the other hand, equality of access to job training programs between white women and black women characteristic in the 1970s was undermined during the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, we also found that as these women matured, the intensity of the job training experience resulted in higher wages regardless of the duration of the program and independently of a participant's educational level and work history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We believe that these results can serve to inform the current debate regarding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. To the extent that job training increases income, thwarted access to such programs along racial lines remains problematic. Many business leaders have implemented <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs designed to increase diversity and to ensure that historical wrongs are addressed along lines of both race and gender. Our results suggest that human resource personnel still need to find ways to increase the accessibility of job training programs to black working women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are not suggesting that access be denied to some at the expense of others. Rather, our view is one of expanding the job training pie, so to speak. That is, to the extent businesses want to attract qualified and diverse personnel, the provision of on-the-job training represents an investment in human capital with tangible rewards to their employees. That such investments also increase the bottom line is not in doubt. Employers can again ensure equal access to job training programs as was the case in the 1970s, and they can do so in light of the more equitable distributive gains between unskilled-semiskilled and managerial-professional training programs made in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In regard to individual workers, our results suggest that on-the-job training is a worthwhile pursuit. Increasingly, technology makes today's skills outdated tomorrow. Lifelong learning is an ideal whose time has come. Skill acquisition can no longer be seen as fixed. Instead, individual workers will need to seek out ways to upgrade their skills, thereby demonstrating added value beyond that of accumulated wisdom that often accompanies accumulated experience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the future, greater economic rewards are likely to go to those whose competencies change to fit the organizational profile of a valued worker. Women will be very much a part of this workplace. They need to seek both on-the-job and off-the-job training opportunities that are necessary for advancement. Black women in particular must take proactive efforts to ensure access programs commensurate with their individual aspirations and abilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also have a responsibility to serve as role models and coaches to the next generation of women preparing to enter the workforce. Women also must share their experiences with younger women through mentoring programs. Advocating that high school girls take extra mathematical, computer science and science courses will help to prepare them for the workplace of tomorrow. Encouraging young women to pursue college degrees and to take seriously the commitment to continuing education may help to diminish the job segregation that is still too commonplace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Businesses should see on-the-job training as investments in human capital that are mutually advantageous for themselves and their workers. Of particular importance is continuous learning for mid-career employees, who may be far removed from academic life per se. Rather than creating an environment that disposes of dependable, competent workers whose specific skills may be needed less as time goes on, employers can capitalize on known quantities by providing access to job training designed to meet the changing requirements of the job. In so doing, employers should judge performance in terms of competencies and avoid channeling women into stereotypic roles or roles narrowly associated with past work histories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lower access to training and over representation in clerical programs for black women may have channeled them into jobs not commensurate with their abilities. Black women remain the most underrepresented in managerial positions. Organizations in today's competitive market do not have the luxury to waste talent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study described in this article was published in the Human Resource Development Quarterly, Fall 1997 issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTOS: Mary Cianni is associate professor of management at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania and Richard K.

ANALYSIS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The presidential race in many ways can now be reduced to this: a contest between the lovers and the haters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lovers are those who hold great affection for George W. Bush, his philosophy of government, his socially conservative beliefs and his resolve on issues like Iraq and the war on terrorism. The haters are those who can't stand the president for precisely the same reasons. There hasn't been a grand embrace of challenger John Kerry, and even in the waning days before the election, a Kerry agenda is still not easy to define.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the country were electing a debater in chief, after three rounds, most would give the title to the Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His performances were more even and consistent, his presentation of facts and command of issues more clear. On this night, his burden was obvious: to persuade people to deny the president a second term, to point out with precision what the haters hate most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The motivation to vote against someone is often more powerful than the desire to vote for someone, and in that sense, the president faces a perilous finish to the campaign. He will be relying on his legion of lovers and hope that the haters have hit the wall. He is still stoking the energy of Republican partisans, painting Kerry with the familiar \"out of the mainstream\" brush, while Kerry seems to believe there are still people to be won over in the increasingly small lane in the middle of the road, especially undecided women voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 90-minute session focused almost entirely on the issues that form the fault lines of American politics--abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage, faith, taxes and the role of government in health care and education. On each of those issues, the debate served to outline distinct differences between the two men.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clear choice</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all the things that voters might say they lack when they cast ballots in November, a clear choice should not be one of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incumbent president in a time of war and a troubled economy faced the greater challenge to defend his record. There were simply more targets for Kerry to attack. But the president also played on the dangers the nation faces as part of his contention that a chance for Kerry is not a chance worth taking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the president was put on the defensive several times, especially about the economy. Asked what he might say to a worker who had lost a job to outsourcing to a foreign country with lower wages, the president responded that education was the best kind of government jobs program in the long run. How that will play in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Missouri, which have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, is unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry repeatedly played to a theme of class warfare that has been a Democratic staple since Franklin Roosevelt, but without Roosevelt's rhetorical gifts for empathy. Kerry also sounded echoes of Bill Clinton (\"people who work hard and play by the rules\"), but his style would never be confused with Clinton's either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Social issues</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On social issues, the president was far clearer in ways that will no doubt help him energize Republican partisans, but might be unlikely to win over many in the shrinking pool of undecided voters. He said he didn't know if homosexuality were a \"choice\" as opposed to a birthright, but he reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In addition, he refused the chance to say that a woman had a constitutional right to choice on abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That provided a clear opening to Kerry to appeal to women voters, whom polls suggest have been gravitating toward the Democrat since the first debate in Coral Gables, Fla., last month. Kerry said he would only support a justice to the Supreme Court who believed in the constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Loaded lines</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each candidate clearly entered the debate with a couple of loaded lines that they were ready to fire off at an appropriate moment. Neither man's effort was particularly successful, but the president's almost-forced efforts to caricature Kerry as a Massachusetts liberal to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy appeared to fall decidedly flat, except to the hard-core partisans who can never hear enough of that kind of talk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They no doubt also enjoyed Bush's dig at the integrity of the major broadcast network news operations. For his part, Kerry's analogy to Tony Soprano is unlikely to be part of any permanent debate highlight reel either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning the presidency, of course, is about much more than winning a debate and the personal connection that a candidate makes has become fundamentally important in the age of television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president offered more personal warmth than he had in the other debates, particularly when discussing his wife, Laura. Kerry still cannot match Bush's ability to make a personal connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the night of this final debate, he seemed to be quite conscious of a steady, dispassionate gaze at Kerry when he was talking, and of keeping his own voice lower. His supporters like it when he shows a little fight and fire, though.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore's biggest mistake of his presidential campaign in 2000 might well have been that he offered three different personas in his three debates with George Bush. Bush was no Gore in that respect, but he did seem to adjust his style from one debate to the next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry has used the three debates to great advantage, especially relative to the president, gaining credibility with each. The president righted himself in the second debate in St. Louis and did little to hurt or distinguish himself in Tempe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Final national plea</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's debate in Tempe likely signaled the last big national moment of the campaign, the final time when millions of Americans paid intense attention to the race. The candidates are likely to revert to rote of their stump speeches and the grind of travel from tarmac to tarmac, narrowcast to hit as many select television markets as possible. Good morning, Dayton. Good morning, Des Moines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incumbents who don't win debates, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, haven't fared well on Election Day. There is a presumption in the electorate that presidents are supposed to be able to perform on television under pressure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are supposed to be able not only to defend their term in office but to persuade that they deserve another. The president has three more weeks to make that case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush and Sen.

I could also see that the separation of church and state has gone up in smoke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I felt a sense of doom that I couldn't articulate. Mr. Robinson helped me understand what could be on the horizon. Are we to become a Christian nation? Who else, in addition to women, could become second-class citizens with a single Supreme Court vote? What about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>? What happens to the rights of LGBTQ citizens?

Make no mistake about it. Remember that the Southern states insisted that they were not fighting to preserve the institution of slavery, but that they were fighting to preserve and protect states' rights. And now Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and others have done just that. They have turned over the entire bundle of civil rights to the states. Oh, it hasn't happened yet, but you can see the state legislatures scrambling to undo civil rights legislation as we speak. It won't be long, as people are speculating, before gay rights, students' rights, immigrants' rights and others are taken away, just as a fundamental women's right has been.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Frankly, I fear that this eviscerating of civil rights won't stop until the states have revoked Brown v. Board of Education. Then the clock will rewind until we arrive at 1896 and Plessy v. Ferguson. Separate but equal. And a new era of Jim Crow. Just look at a map of the red states: the solid South and the old Civil War territories that run up the spine of America from Oklahoma to the Dakotas. The Supreme Court just finished what 150 years of agitation by those states couldn't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was not a good week for America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael D. Abell, Marriottsville</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The June 26 front-page article \"Many Americans fearful that wave of repeals could be on horizon\" referred to several rights that could be on the chopping block, but it missed a big one: Title IX. Though Title IX is a law, not a Supreme Court decision, it could be collateral damage from the ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the article stated, the majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade \"rested on the view that the individual liberties guaranteed by the 14th Amendment protected only rights that had 'deep roots' in states when it was ratified in 1868.\" Women had virtually no rights in 1868, and Title IX is a mere 50 years old, so there are no deep roots protecting it. If it is challenged and the case reaches the Supreme Court, would the court apply the same rationale to Title IX as it did with the Roe v. Wade repeal for the sake of consistency? If so, Title IX could be in serious jeopardy. It would be horrible to see Title IX fall, but, based on the rationale for overturning Roe v. Wade, it's certainly possible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The time to prepare to defend Title IX is now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>George Miller, Warrenton</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government is for those who will not govern themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pregnancy is not a moral issue, a religious issue or a legal issue.

And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a thousand times [and] remarked that he -- her father, my papaw -- had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do. ... Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, trying to explain why she identified herself as a \"minority\" law professor in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IT happens in a lot of American families. My maternal great-grandfather was born on a Maine island in the 1880s, in the days when Penobscot Indians still rode birch-bark canoes from their inland reservation to the coast for their annual clambake. I always had the definite idea that he had Indian blood himself -- maybe Penobscot, maybe Abenaki, maybe another New England tribe. In the photographs I have of him, he certainly looks the part, with a profile suited for an Indian Head penny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My great-grandfather left an autobiography behind, though (that's how I know about the canoes and the clambake), and I went back to it recently and couldn't find even a hint of an Indian connection: just a typical old New England genealogy, mostly English families with some Irish woven in. This would have been immensely disappointing to my 10-year-old self, since I can remember telling friends in American history class, with an air of authority, that I was almost certainly one sixteenth Native American, or at the very least one thirty-second.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems that Elizabeth Warren may turn out to be similarly disappointed, after the New England Genealogical Society acknowledged last week that there's no firm evidence of her great-great-grandmother being Cherokee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That supposed ancestral tie was what inspired the professor-turned-Senate candidate to identify as an ethnic minority in law school directories early in her career. More important, it was what inspired The Harvard Crimson to refer to Warren as Harvard Law School's \"one tenured minority woman\" and The Fordham Law Review to cite her as Harvard Law's \"first woman of color\" during the mid-1990s debates over faculty diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that same claim -- and her clumsy, \"my grandfather had high cheekbones\" attempts to defend it -- has become perhaps the biggest obstacle in her quest to reclaim Ted Kennedy's Senate seat for liberalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole story has a tragicomic, Nathaniel Hawthorne meets \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" feel. It's easy to imagine Warren originally checking a box more on a whim than out of any deep determination to self-identify as Cherokee. (She didn't use the minority-applicant program when applying to Rutgers, where she attended law school, and she identified as \"white\" during an early teaching job at the University of Texas.) Then it's easy to imagine her embarrassment when the diversity wars of the 1990s made that whimsical choice something from which she couldn't dissociate herself without intense public awkwardness. Those wars faded, she no longer listed herself as a Native American, she thought the whole thing was behind her ... until she went into politics, where no secret stays buried.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appropriate response to such a tale is probably sympathy rather than scorn. What does deserve scorn, though, is the academic culture in which an extremely distant connection to a Cherokee ancestor ends up being touted by a law school as proof of its commitment to diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diverse faculty and campus can be a laudable goal. But the point is to build academic communities that actually contain a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, not to wax self-congratulatory because you've met a set of ethnic quotas. The story of Elizabeth Warren, \"woman of color,\" represents a reductio ad absurdum of the latter tendency, which has been all too prevalent in elite universities -- giving us <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs that benefit West Indian immigrants more than the descendants of slaves, and faculties that include a wider range of skin tones than of political and religious views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The irony is that Warren herself probably did make Harvard more diverse, since she grew up the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma -- not a typical background, to put it mildly, for Ivy League students and faculty today. But under the academy's cramped definitions, it was her grandfather's Cherokee cheekbones, not her blue-collar roots, that led to her citation as a supposed trailblazer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't a serious approach to academic diversity, and in an emerging majority-minority America (already visible in the latest Census birth statistics) where almost everyone will be 1/8 something-or-other, it will be an increasingly untenable one as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many colleges and universities, then, this contretemps represents a timely gift: a chance to think anew about these issues, before the pursuit of a cosmetic diversity leaves them looking as ridiculous as poor Elizabeth Warren does today.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}

Move to Hawaii</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \u201caloha spirit\u201d may hold a deep lesson for all of us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HONOLULU \u2014 Kristin Pauker still remembers her uncle\u2019s warning about Dartmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a white institution,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel out of place.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker, who is now a psychology professor, is of mixed ancestry, her mother of Japanese descent and her father white from an Italian-Irish background. Applying to colleges, she was keen to leave Hawaii for the East Coast, eager to see something new and different. But almost immediately after she arrived on campus in 1998, she understood what her uncle had meant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She encountered a barrage of questions from fellow students. What was her ethnicity? Where was she from? Was she Native Hawaiian? The questions seemed innocent on the surface, but she sensed that the students were really asking what box to put her in. And that categorization would determine how they treated her. \u201cIt opened my eyes to the fact that not everyone sees race the same way,\u201d she told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in Hawaii, being mixed was so common as to be nearly unremarkable. Many of her friends were some mixture of East Asian ethnicities, white, Filipino, Hawaiian and more, and for the most part, everyone hung out with everyone else. The Dartmouth student body, on the other hand, seemed self-segregated. The nonwhite students primarily stuck with their own race \u2014 blacks sat with blacks in the cafeteria, Asians with Asians, Native Americans with Native Americans. (Dartmouth, which was around 75 percent white then, has since doubled its share of nonwhite students.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time in her life, she wasn\u2019t sure where she belonged, and she found herself wondering: Does it have to be like this?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few years later, as a graduate student in psychology at Tufts, she began her first study probing that question. Psychologists argue that \u201cessentialist\u201d thinking \u2014 ideas about human beings\u2019 unchangeable essence, their inherent inferiority or the threat they supposedly pose \u2014 makes racism possible. Dr. Pauker wanted to know when children started expressing essentialist views of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She found that between ages 4 and 11, upper-middle-class children from mostly white neighborhoods around Boston increasingly viewed race as a permanent condition and expressed stereotypes about other racial groups: that blacks were aggressive or, on the flip side, good at basketball; that Asians were submissive and good at math. These children came from public schools in liberal areas. They probably weren\u2019t deliberately taught these stereotypes at home. But they absorbed them from the American ether nonetheless.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would children in Hawaii express the same views? Dr. Pauker repeated the study with middle- and upper-middle-class grade-school students in and around Honolulu, and was not entirely surprised to find that in Hawaii, the children, including those who were white, tended not to express the same essentialist ideas about race. They were not race-blind. They recognized skin color, hair texture and other features commonly associated with race. But they did not attribute to race the inherent qualities \u2014 aggression or book smarts \u2014 that their mainland brethren did. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe that race was biological,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She had a hypothesis to explain the difference. Whites dominated in the Boston area schools, but were a minority in Hawaii, and always had been. Hawaii also had the highest percentage of mixed-race people by a long shot in the country. (Among them was our first mixed-race president, Barack Obama, who was born there.) Mixed-race people, who make up nearly a quarter of Hawaii\u2019s population of 1.4 million, serve as a kind of jamming mechanism for people\u2019s race radar, Dr. Pauker thinks. Because if you can\u2019t tell what people are by looking at them \u2014 if their very existence blurs the imagined boundaries between supposedly separate groups \u2014 then race becomes a less useful way to think about people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019m interested in all of this partly because I myself come from a mixed background. I have an Ashkenazi Jewish father and a Puerto Rican mother (neither of which, I should point out, is a race). I first came across Dr. Pauker some years ago while researching mixed-race identity formation. The question of how people from mixed backgrounds create their identity has, until recently, mostly been ignored by psychologists. The assumption has been that mixed-race people likely have a difficult time because they\u2019re from (at least) two cultures but inhabit a world that often requires total allegiance to one group or another. And there\u2019s some truth to this. Researchers have documented how the unique challenges encountered by mixed people can, depending on the social context, negatively affect their mental health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Dr. Pauker belongs to a small group of psychologists, many of them mixed themselves, who have begun to explore the advantages of being multiracial. For instance, Sarah Gaither at Duke, a frequent collaborator of Dr. Pauker\u2019s, has discovered that, when reminded of their multiracial heritage, mixed-race individuals score higher on tests that measure creativity. This is probably not because they are inherently superior in some way, but because the very thing that\u2019s so difficult for them \u2014 the need to navigate multiple worlds \u2014 may actually enhance mental flexibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plenty of research indicates that diversity has many benefits. Diverse groups are better at problem-solving; in mock trials, diverse juries give fairer verdicts; diverse companies are more profitable; researchers argue that diverse countries have stronger economies. And the United States is not only becoming more diverse, it\u2019s also growing more mixed. Mixed-race people are among the fastest-growing segments of the population \u2014 between 2.6 percent and 6.9 percent of the population, depending on the study. By 2060, the segment is projected to double.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, at the same time, we seem to be in the throes of a backlash against diversity, against mixing, with many people trying to claw their way back to a largely mythical, more homogeneous past. Could Hawaii show us another way forward? I flew there to find out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One day, I sat down under an enormous tree on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and tried to count the people I saw walking with companions of different racial backgrounds. One of Dr. Pauker\u2019s arguments about what makes Hawaii special is that people have numerous cross-group acquaintances. Forty percent end up marrying someone from outside their own group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campus was clearly diverse, but I quickly realized the assumption underlying my fieldwork was fatally flawed. Here I was trying to discern ancestry, but how was I to know anyone\u2019s background just by looking, particularly in a place where people were so mixed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My gaffe got me musing about the many assumptions we inherit about race without really thinking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the more pernicious myths to take root in the modern mind is that racism is human nature, that it\u2019s an inevitable part of who we are, a product of our evolution. You\u2019ve probably heard the argument. We\u2019re group animals. We instinctually divide the world into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d Groups compete with one another. They invariably enter into conflict. Even chimpanzee \u201ctribes\u201d wage war with one another, after all. We\u2019re thus doomed to look down on people we\u2019re not familiar with \u2014 to \u201cotherize,\u201d in modern academic jargon, those who don\u2019t look or speak like us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, this is only part of the story. In the 1960s, the social psychologist Marilynn Brewer tested the idea that human cultures naturally divided the world into in-groups and out-groups, and that they instinctually despised people who were unfamiliar. She and her colleagues conducted interviews with people in 19 non-Western cultures. Yes, some were hostile to other groups. But many actually respected and admired them. Their attitude was, to quote one respondent, \u201cWe have our ways and they have their ways.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cThe assumption that groups are competitive, that out-group hate is a correlate of in-group love, that it\u2019s built on our evolution as a social species \u2014 it\u2019s just not true,\u201d Dr. Brewer told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of race as an essential aspect of one\u2019s personhood didn\u2019t always dominate, even in the West. Some ancient Greeks ascribed human differences in skin tone and hair texture to climate, an idea that\u2019s similar to the modern scientific understanding of the variation that underlies what we call race. That doesn\u2019t mean that the Greeks saw all humans as equal. They had plenty of slaves. Women were second-class citizens. And they divided the world into Greek, or civilized, and barbarian. Being civilized was clearly superior. But being barbarian wasn\u2019t an inescapable condition, the way many would come to think of race in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Centuries later, the Romans had a similar view, dividing people not by skin color, but by whether they were Romanized or non-Romanized. Again, these differences were not seen as inherent. The Romanized Gauls used to be like the non-Romanized Germans, Julius Caesar observed during his military campaigns in Western and Central Europe. People could change. A Celt or Egyptian who moved to Rome would, you\u2019d expect, become just as Roman as the next guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When did this more flexible understanding of race begin to harden? Some historians point to the 14th century as a turning point. Until then, Jews in Europe had some legal rights. But in 1348, the plague struck. Many believed that the Jews were responsible; they began to move away from the view that Jews were people who merely had a different religion and toward the idea that they were inherently corrupt and dangerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came the African slave trade of the 16th century. In earlier times, slaves often came from Eastern Europe. (The word \u201cslave\u201d is related to \u201cSlav.\u201d) But with the discovery of the Americas and the surge in demand for labor, slavers set their sights on sub-Saharan Africa. They justified this plundering of humanity with arguments about the supposed inferiority and bestiality of Africans. In the United States, these ideas would evolve into a sadistic paternalism \u2014 that slavery was actually good for Africans because they were incapable of self-governance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These ideas \u2014 and probably all racist ideas \u2014 served a clear purpose: to buttress an economic system that depended on free labor. As Ibram X. Kendi pointed out in his book \u201cStamped From the Beginning,\u201d hate does not necessarily precede racism. Instead, societies often spin racist ideas out of self-interest \u2014 to further political or economic goals \u2014 and these ideas then lead to hate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even with the major effort that went into promoting the racial hierarchy, in the early Colonial period, poor whites frequently mingled and found common cause with African-Americans. Late-17th-century Colonial Virginia had a thriving multiracial population. Long before Karl Marx\u2019s class-based critique of capitalism, poor whites and blacks joined forces in several rebellions. The most famous was Bacon\u2019s Rebellion in 1676, in which indentured white servants and free and enslaved blacks took up arms against Virginia\u2019s governor but were crushed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This revolt shook the elites, who worked even harder to enforce the color lines. A series of laws meant to prevent interracial mingling (and to clearly define blacks as property, not citizens) went into effect. A white person in Virginia could be banished from the colony for having a child with a black or biracial person. White men might be whipped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason given for these laws was some version of wanting to prevent the \u201cabominable mixture\u201d of the races. But the true purpose was to keep the structures of race intact in the American mind so that the economy, which depended on stolen labor, could continue whirring along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us back to Hawaii. Dr. Pauker runs the Intergroup Social Perception Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Maybe her most intriguing finding is that Hawaii can rub off on visitors, changing how they think about race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some years ago, she began following 143 white college students from the mainland who\u2019d come to Hawaii to study. Over time, she discovered, many of them lost the essentialist ideas that characterized their thinking about race when they\u2019d just arrived. Dr. Pauker gauged this shift with a widely used questionnaire called the \u201cRace Conception Scale.\u201d It asks subjects to assess, on a seven-point scale, statements like \u201cracial groups are primarily determined by biology\u201d and \u201ca person\u2019s race is fixed at birth.\u201d The mainland students began to think about race more like students in Hawaii did \u2014 as a fluid concept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many reasons for this transformation, she thinks. White mainland students often find themselves in the minority for the first time in their lives. And it\u2019s not always easy. Just as students of color often drop out at a higher rate than whites from universities on the mainland, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, it\u2019s white students who drop out at higher rates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The statistic hints at what the white mainland students are going through. They are escaping, probably for the first time, what sociologists call \u201cwhite transparency.\u201d Whiteness stops being invisible to them; they suddenly perceive themselves as having a color \u2014 a race. And if they\u2019re going to have friends, they\u2019re forced to socialize with nonwhites, which means pushing past their preconceptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is likely humbling and occasionally painful. But pain can mean growth. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like when you go and exercise,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me. \u201cUnless you tire your muscles out and experience some pain and discomfort, you\u2019re not going to get any benefit.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most remarkably, as these students\u2019 ideas about race relax, Dr. Pauker finds that they score higher on other tests of cognitive flexibility. They become more creative problem-solvers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Dr. Pauker and I discussed this over a poke bowl \u2014 a Hawaiian dish with East Asian influences that has become popular on the mainland, too \u2014 it brought to mind something James Baldwin said decades ago: Racism exacts a toll on those who are racist, distorting their humanity and hindering their ability to be fully self-reflective beings. That\u2019s surely no consolation to the victims of racism, but Dr. Pauker\u2019s findings seem to confirm Baldwin\u2019s thesis. The mental rigidity required to harbor racist ideas ends up bleeding over into other cognitive domains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIn lots of circumstances, rigidity is helpful,\u201d Dr. Pauker told me, because it conserves mental energy. In theory, racial categorizing is supposed to work like a shorthand, helping us determine how to interact with people while expending minimal energy figuring out who they actually are. The problem, though, is that our perception of race and what it means is based on a model of the world that\u2019s almost always incorrect, and often entirely fabricated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s studies have important caveats. White students who have come here from the mainland are, almost by definition, already an open-minded, adventurous bunch. Maybe it\u2019s not so surprising that for them, spending time in a nonmajority-white place would change how they think about race. The real trick would be to get a white supremacist to enroll here and see if there was the same transformation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Hawaii the harmonious melting pot is also a clich\u00e9 in its own right. Even in the early 20th century, mainland sociologists observing Hawaii marveled at how its different groups seemed to get along so well. They pointed to the archipelago, then a United States territory, as a vision of the future of civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cWe seem to be brought, so to speak, into the very presence of the historical process, where we may observe civilization as it evolves under something like laboratory conditions,\u201d wrote the University of Chicago sociologist Robert Park in 1937 about Hawaii. In 1925, the sociologist Romanzo Adams put it this way: \u201cThere is abundant evidence that the peoples of Hawaii are in process of becoming one people.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The interracial harmony that supposedly reigned was cited by other mainlanders to make more self-serving arguments. During World War II, the fact that people of Japanese descent, then the largest ethnic group on the islands, were loyal Americans was held up as evidence that the United States was not, as Japanese propaganda claimed, engaged in a racial war with Japan. During the Cold War, as communism spread in Asia, Americans pointed to Hawaii as evidence that Asians and other nonwhites could be well integrated into American society. And during the civil rights era, Hawaii was held up as a place where nonwhite people were happy with their lot. Why couldn\u2019t African-Americans be more like them? (In fact, partly inspired by the civil rights movement of the mainland, Native Hawaiians led a Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Hawaiian academics are understandably sick of their state being seen by outsiders as a model of racial harmony. They view it as a fantasy that papers over very real inequities. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t glorify ourselves,\u201d Jonathan Y. Okamura, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told me. \u201cWe need to work on the ways in which we continue to foster unequal opportunities for groups here.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prejudice against Micronesians, a recent immigrant group, is openly expressed, for example. People say things about them \u2014 calling them cockroaches and pushing for their genocide \u2014 \u201cthat would not fly anywhere else in this day and age,\u201d Sha Merirei Ongelungel, an artist and activist of Palauan descent, told me. Disgusted by this behavior, she created the Twitter hashtag #BeingMicronesian for people to share their experiences of prejudice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Being African-American isn\u2019t easy in Hawaii, either, said Akiemi Glenn, executive director of the Popolo Project in Honolulu. Stereotypes about African-Americans abound, she told me, in part because so few black people live on the islands to push back against them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, Ms. Glenn, whose family is from North Carolina, said that there is a complexity here that\u2019s lacking on the mainland. Ms. Glenn has Chinese, Native American, African and European ancestors. Back in North Carolina, she\u2019s just black. There\u2019s no room to claim her Chinese ancestry. But in Hawaii it often becomes a way to find common ground with others. \u201cThere are spaces for people to acknowledge their diverse genealogy,\u201d Ms. Glenn told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did this space open up in Hawaii? Historians I asked pointed with reverence to one thing: the union organizing that occurred here in the postwar period.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the late 19th century, Hawaii was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a  Hawaiian monarch. That ended in 1893 when a group of mostly white plantation owners, descended from an earlier wave of missionaries, overthrew the Hawaiian queen and declared, perversely, a republic. Their goal was annexation by the United States, which occurred in 1898, and access to its markets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, plantation owners imported workers from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and as far away as Portugal. They believed that, divided by different languages and cultures, the workers would be less likely to conspire together and cause trouble. Ethnic and racial stereotyping was widespread. The Chinese \u201ccoolies\u201d were cast as depraved gamblers; the Filipinos as prone to violence; the Japanese as cliquish and loyal only to the ascendant Japanese empire. The Portuguese, who tended to have higher-ranking jobs than everyone else, were a lesser form of white \u2014 better than the \u201cAsiatics\u201d they managed, but not quite good enough to join the Anglo-Saxon elite. Native Hawaiians, meanwhile, were seen as good-natured but lazy, and in need of white paternalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after World War II, in the space of a few years, this social order rapidly changed. The San Francisco-based International Longshore and Warehouse Union began organizing plantation, dock and other workers in Hawaii, who often labored in wretched conditions. Success would require interracial unity, union organizers quickly realized. The workers needed to overcome the ethnic divisions of plantation society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, sociologist Moon-Kie Jung describes what followed as \u201cproto <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\u201d To build a union everyone would buy into, all ethnic groups had to be equally represented. And so union leadership positions were deliberately parceled out among ethnic groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not everyone in Hawaii was a longshoreman or plantation worker, of course. Yet that epoch of deliberate restructuring of the working class, Professor Okamura and others say, had a long-lasting effect on Hawaiian society. The effort succeeded in getting better working conditions from the \u201cbig five\u201d sugar and fruit companies that ruled the economy. Organized labor became a political force, helping to usher the Democratic Party into power in 1954. The party, which has largely dominated the state ever since, passed a series of progressive laws leading to investment in public education and a higher minimum wage, and the state in 1974 became the first to mandate employer-provided health insurance. (The progressive tradition continues today: An early challenge to President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban came from Hawaii.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We might call this the Marxist reading on what went right in Hawaii. Working-class Hawaiians realized that race was being used to divide them \u2014 keeping them from improving their lot. Dr. Brewer, the social psychologist, described this transformation as labor successfully creating a new \u201csuper ordinate\u201d identity that cut across racial lines. That new identity did not totally erase old divisions, but it superseded them, at least for a while. (It probably also helped that Hawaii never had any laws against miscegenation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent decades, the legacy of labor organizing has begun to fray, says Professor Okamura. Hawaii now has a high proportion of students in private school. Its public schools have become more racially and ethnically segregated, preventing the intergroup relationships that he thinks were so important in the past. But he says the history of organized labor in Hawaii suggests that you can, by deliberately dismantling racial barriers and fostering opportunity for everyone, change race relations in society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One other holdover from Hawaii\u2019s plantation past, when laborers of different backgrounds worked closely together, is a tradition of ethnic joke-telling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is not a politically correct society where everyone is \u201cwoke.\u201d On the contrary, ethnic jokes are so common it can be jarring for people who aren\u2019t from Hawaii. (Here\u2019s one from the well-known Hawaiian-born comedian Frank De Lima, who himself has Portuguese ancestry: \u201cWhy did the Portagee water half of his lawn? He heard there was a 50 percent chance of rain.\u201d)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s lab hasn\u2019t formally studied this \u2014 and there is academic debate about how benign these ethnic jokes really are \u2014 but she thinks that the tradition may do some good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberal parents often claim they\u2019re blind to race, that they don\u2019t see it. But Dr. Pauker has found that, on the mainland, this may paradoxically allow stereotypes to creep into children\u2019s understanding of race. If you don\u2019t actively shape how children think about race, they may be more likely to absorb hurtful and damaging clich\u00e9s from the social ether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Partly because of racial joking, race is always on the mind here. When people think about race consciously, she posits, it helps prevent essentialist thinking from taking root unconsciously. Joking about ethnic stereotypes, especially about one\u2019s own group, at least keeps conversations about race in Hawaii on the surface, rather than pushing them underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People are frank about other aspects of race as well in Hawaii. When she grew up, she recalls, people often referred to her as \u201cthat hapa girl\u201d (\u2018hapa\u201d means \u201chalf\u201d in Hawaiian pidgin), and she didn\u2019t think twice about it. Maybe that\u2019s because so many others were also hapa. Or perhaps that nonchalance is because this racial ribbing didn\u2019t occur against a background of any clear majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An intriguing finding from Dr. Pauker\u2019s lab is that kids in Hawaii are terrible at defining other people\u2019s race compared with kids on the mainland. That\u2019s not because they don\u2019t see the features usually associated with race. It\u2019s because, when shown photos, they complicate their answers. Whereas a kid on the mainland might simply say \u201cAsian,\u201d in Hawaii, kids tend to say something like, \u201cJapanese, Chinese, Filipino and Norwegian.\u201d Instead of labeling a face \u201cwhite\u201d and leaving it at that, they might offer \u201cScottish, Irish, German and Italian.\u201d They are like fine wine connoisseurs while everyone else drinks cheap beer. From an early age, they see race as something complex and full of nuance, not something simple or black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if Dr. Pauker and her colleagues are right that increased diversity and mixing help quash racism, why is the mainland now experiencing what feels like a resurgence of tribalism?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker\u2019s answer is that while, yes, the United States has become more diverse, Americans have also become more ideologically segregated from one another, making the kinds of meaningful interactions that erode racial thinking less likely. Part of that segregation comes from the news we watch, which has become more Balkanized. Part of it is the echo chamber of social media, which reflects back our own views. But another big reason may be the apparent absence of a larger umbrella identity \u2014 an American identity \u2014 that can supersede and contain tribal identities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, Hawaii has that, too \u2014 an identity that, despite the efforts to prevent its emergence, coalesced among plantation workers. It\u2019s exemplified in the \u201caloha spirit,\u201d a concept roughly defined as an emphasis on mutual respect, getting along and taking care of one another, and in Hawaiian pidgin, the language people from many different backgrounds working on the plantation created to communicate. This identity is simply called \u201clocal.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But are any of these lessons really applicable on the mainland, or anywhere else?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is unique historically, demographically and perhaps most crucially, geographically. Justin Gest, a political scientist at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government who studies the evolution of island societies, told me that islands, separated as they are from currents on the mainland, are often unique laboratories of human culture, caldrons where ingredients from different cultures recombine into something new. Living on a small, circumscribed piece of land marooned in the sea, Dr. Pauker points out, forces you to interact with your neighbors in ways that may not occur on continents. And when destructive forces threaten to tear society apart, those relationships matter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider what happened with the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Worried about espionage and worse, the government rounded up and interned about 120,000 Japanese-Americans on the mainland. Hawaii arrested far fewer, about 1,800 \u2014 and that was despite the fact that some 150,000 people of Japanese ancestry then lived on the islands, and that Japanese planes had just bombed Pearl Harbor. What was different?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The officials in charge in Hawaii had deep connections with the local Japanese community. Robert Shivers, who headed Honolulu\u2019s F.B.I. office, and who had been dispatched from the mainland precisely to surveil the Japanese in the lead-up to World War II, had a young Japanese student living in his house, whom he would refer to as his adopted daughter. John Burns, the head of the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s Espionage Bureau, who grew up in Hawaii and would become the state\u2019s second governor, also had deep ties in the Japanese community. Both resisted calls from Washington to intern the Japanese, a story told by the journalist Tom Coffman in his book \u201cThe Island Edge of America.\u201d They also belonged to a multiethnic group called the Council for Interracial Unity, which had convened precisely to prevent the implosion of Hawaiian society in the event of war with Japan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This brings me back to the \u201caloha spirit,\u201d which may hold a deeper lesson for all of us. This tradition, several people told me, came from Native Hawaiian culture. Professor Okamura, who otherwise pooh-poohed the idea of Hawaiian racial harmony, related how Native Hawaiians offered his great-grandmother food when she first arrived from Japan. Mr. Burns, who was governor from 1962 to 1974, recalled Hawaiians inviting him to eat as he wandered the beach as a boy. The mother of Daniel Inouye, the senator from Hawaii, was adopted and raised by a Native Hawaiian family \u2014 something she often reminded him of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Separately, these are all just heartwarming anecdotes. But together they suggest that even as Hawaii was subject to the divisive forces roiling the world, a different set of local customs coursing beneath the surface served as a type of counterbalance. Where did they come from?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Capt. James Cook first arrived in Hawaii in 1778, between 200,000 and 800,000 people lived in the archipelago. (Huge swaths of the population later succumbed to diseases the Westerners brought with them.) Polynesians may have first come to the islands as early as 1,700 years ago. Over the centuries, they developed elaborate methods of agricultural and resource management. They irrigated fields of taro, sugar cane, sweet potato and coconut trees with intricate ditches. Along the shore, they built fish ponds. They prohibited fishing in the ocean during certain seasons, an ancient form of sustainable fishery management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, crucially, the Hawaiians traded and shared among themselves \u2014 because to survive, they had to. People from the uplands exchanged sweet potato for fish with people from the coasts. A cultural norm of hospitality emerged. The islands weren\u2019t a utopia, of course. They experienced wars and occasional famines, and even had a kind of untouchable caste. But a premium was placed on getting along \u2014 the \u201caloha spirit.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a tourist commercial,\u201d Davianna Pomaikai McGregor, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said as she explained this to me. \u201cBut I think the Native Hawaiian people and the practice of aloha set the framework\u201d for race relations on the islands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason it sounds like a TV jingle is that it has become one: \u201cAloha\u201d is a marketing gimmick for the state\u2019s primary industry, tourism. A cartoonish version blares at visitors the moment they get off the plane, often in the form of dancers in grass skirts. Everyone I spoke to with Native ancestry found this irritating and sometimes insulting. One, a university student, told me that she felt like \u201caloha\u201d was used to make Native Hawaiians invisible in their own land. So it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s missing from the tourist version. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to give back, not just take take take,\u201d Mahesh Cleveland, a Hawaiian-born lawyer with Native ancestry, told me. \u201cThere is an expectation of reciprocity.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an explanation about why race relations are different in Hawaii, the \u201caloha spirit\u201d is actually quite profound. It suggests that attitudes about other people stem, in part, from our understanding of the ecological limits of the world we inhabit. If you think that the resources of the world are limitless and that you don\u2019t really need other people to survive \u2014 that they\u2019re disposable because the bounty is endless \u2014 you may be inclined to treat people as things. But if you\u2019re aware of how much you depend on others and how small and fragile the world is, you\u2019re likely to have a very different approach to human relationships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Traditions of hospitality toward the stranger exist in many cultures. They\u2019re central to Christianity, for instance. But for the past 500 years of European and then American expansion, during which the modern race idea was forged, the idea that the world\u2019s bounty was limitless, and that there was little downside to its relentless exploitation, has dominated. That attitude is now getting us into trouble as we change the climate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we could begin to grasp the limits of the planet we live on, if we could understand that the earth itself is an island and that we are all dependent on one another for survival, perhaps we would see each other differently, too \u2014 and have less use for the very idea of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But the average Black man in America lives about five fewer years than the average white man. A newborn Black boy in Washington, D.C., has a shorter life expectancy than a newborn boy in India.One of the challenges for those of us in journalism is to do a better job highlighting these inequities that don't come with a viral video.Since Floyd's death, we've focused on racial inequities in the criminal justice system, and it has been easy for liberal white Americans -- my tribe -- to feel indignant and righteous while blaming others. But in some areas, such as an unjust education system, we are part of the problem.At the very time that America was having a racial reckoning about criminal justice, Democratic states were closing in-person schooling in ways that particularly harmed nonwhite students. Race gaps increased, according to research by McKinsey & Company, and a Federal Reserve study suggests that higher dropout rates for marginalized students will have long-term consequences.More broadly, we in the United States embrace a public education system based on local financing that ensures that poor kids go to poor schools and rich kids to rich schools.Yes, it's a \"public\" school system with \"free\" education. So anyone who can afford a typical home in Palo Alto, Calif., costing $3.2 million, can then send children to superb schools. And less than 2 percent of Palo Alto's population is Black.Rucker Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that since 1988, American public schools have become more racially segregated. Roughly 15 percent of Black and Hispanic students attend so-called apartheid schools with fewer than 1 percent white students.In 1973, the Supreme Court came a whisker from overturning this system of unequal school funding, in the case of Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District. Lower courts had ruled that profoundly unequal school funding violated the Constitution, but by a 5-to-4 vote the justices disagreed.This was the Brown v. Board of Education case that went the other way. If a single justice had switched, America would today be a fairer and more equitable nation.Educated white Americans are now repulsed at the thought of systems of separate and unequal drinking fountains for Black Americans but seem comfortable with a Jim Crow financing system resulting in unequal schools for Black children -- even though schools are far more consequential than water fountains.Perhaps that's because we and our children have a stake in this unequal system. Similarly, we accept that elite universities offer legacy preferences that amount to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> for highly privileged children, with bonus consideration for big donors. This is one reason some universities have more students from the richest 1 percent than from the poorest 60 percent.Likewise, wealthy white Americans benefit from single-family zoning laws in the suburbs around those fine \"public\" schools. The effect of this zoning is to freeze out low-income families and keep neighborhoods more segregated.Then there's our skewed tax system: The I.R.S. is more likely to audit impoverished Americans who use the earned-income tax credit and typically earn less than $20,000 than it is to audit people earning $400,000. The county in the United States with the highest audit rate, according to ProPublica, is Humphreys County, Miss., which is impoverished and three-quarters Black.So how do we address these root inequities?We don't have perfect solutions, but many programs promote opportunity and reduce race gaps over time. The time to start is early childhood, with home visiting, quality child care and pre-K. Baby bonds can reduce wealth gaps, and child tax credits cut child poverty. Job training and a higher minimum wage can help families. Many of these elements are in President Biden's three-part proposal to invest in America and Americans, with the goal of reducing child poverty in America by half.One paradox is that while liberals often advocate such measures as ways to reduce racial inequality, polling suggests that this framing actually reduces public support. The best way to win support for these progressive policies, research suggests, is to frame them as reducing class gaps, not race gaps.Back in the early 2000s, white Americans sometimes said in polls that antiwhite bias was a bigger problem than anti-Black bias. That was delusional, and the tumult following the Floyd case increased the share of whites who acknowledge that discrimination persists.So the Floyd case may represent a milestone of progress in criminal justice.

They're always excited on the way out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley replaced him Thursday with Cortez Trotter, a black man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter spent his career on the paramedic side of the department, not the firefighting side. So history is being made on two fronts, not just the obvious one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Trotter is the first black man to run an overwhelmingly white department, where some firefighters won't like him because his skin is darker than theirs. They might be some of the same idiots who've gone on fire radios recently, anonymously yelling racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what about the other historical front?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oddly, the new fire commissioner might not be held responsible for fighting fires and probably won't ever take command of a major fire.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a paramedic and bureaucrat, he has never spent much time directing firefighters in front of burning buildings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the mayor insisted that his decision had nothing to do with politics or symbolism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"No, no no,\" Daley said. \"It's not a symbol. He's qualified. He's very proud. He's African-American. . . . But he's qualified.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To prove that racial politics have nothing to do with his promotion, Trotter served notice that diversity is the most important issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In order for every community to feel confident in the Fire Department and EMS [ambulance] service they receive, our department must reconcile our operational issues,\" Trotter said sternly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"But more importantly, we must address our human relations and diversity problems.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also warned white firefighters who might have a problem with a black boss. He said he wouldn't tolerate any shenanigans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Let me serve notice to those who wrongfully believe that the department is a haven for small-mindedness, offensive behavior and stagnation,\" Trotter said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are entering a new era for the Chicago Fire Department. Please recognize that for what it is, or be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For too long, the Chicago Fire Department has been a club for white guys, with the top jobs handed from grandfather to father to son.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't work anymore in a city that is mostly black and Latino.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It especially doesn't work when the city is run by a white mayor- for-life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But make no mistake, this appointment is about covering Daley's flank, not the Fire Department's flank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Daley controls minority politicians, he's got a problem coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This summer, Daley's friends, the Outfit-connected Duffs, will go on trial in federal court. A grand jury has charged that they fraudulently received $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts, though they were white guys.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In effect, they stole $100 million from black, Latino and female- owned firms. And I don't know how anyone can believe that $100 million in deals leaves City Hall without Daley's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So having Trotter and other minorities out front in high profile positions, getting TV time, can't hurt the mayor. It can only help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter, executive director of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, faces other political challenges too. The vast majority of 911 calls don't involve fires; they involve ambulance requests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This move reflects the changes in the department,\" said a paramedic commander who happens to be white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is not about black and white, it's about paramedics and firefighters, and it's about time that our side of the department got some clout,\" he said. \"Trotter will give us that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fire commissioner's job is political and administrative, yes. But it is also about fighting fires and saving lives, not only of fire victims, but also the lives of firefighters under his command.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has made the political decision that extensive fire command experience isn't necessary for the top fire job. If you've got questions on that front, take it up with him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tragic and needless deaths at the 69 W. Washington St. fire may be attributed to a lack of command experience by some fire bosses at the scene. If Trotter had been commissioner then and it was found he had little if any fire command experience, he'd be the one forced to resign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a paramedic, Trotter will have to earn the respect of firefighters. As a black man, he has decided to push affirmative- action policies while dealing with a union opposed to racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter will need all his political skills to succeed. He's been given a terribly tough job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's all about fire, the political kind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}

A century after Finley Peter Dunne's fictional Irish saloonkeeper made the point, the court has put an interesting spin on Mr. Dooley's theory. At a time when President Bush and his Republican majority in Congress are continually arguing that they have the mandate to appoint extreme conservatives to the federal bench, the highest court of all has surprised many people with its moderation. The Supreme Court, it appears, is better at reading the election returns than some elected politicians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative legal groups had high hopes that the nine justices -- seven of whom were appointed by Republican presidents -- would issue a landmark ruling this term striking down <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joining the court's most liberal members in a 5-to-4 vote, upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions. By endorsing the consideration of race, but barring quotas and rigid formulas, the court essentially ratified an existing national consensus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the term's other blockbuster decision, the court ruled 6 to 3 that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected. In doing so, it erased one of its own worst precedents, the 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, and struck an important blow for gay rights generally. And it brought the law in line with evolving popular opinion, which now solidly holds that private consensual sex should be legal, and that gays should not be subject to discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court surprised the legal community by halting, or at least pausing in, its aggressive states' rights crusade. Until this term the conservative majority, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, had been steadily whittling away at Americans' rights under federal law. It struck down the Violence Against Women Act on ''federalism'' grounds, and held that the nation's 4.8 million state employees are only partly protected by federal disability and age discrimination laws. But this term the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, rejected a federalism claim and held that state workers are fully protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the court's inclination to stick to the mainstream meant it did an uneven job of protecting the marginalized from the excesses of the majority. The court callously turned away a challenge to California's ''three strikes'' law by a man who was given a sentence of 50 years to life for stealing $150 worth of videotapes from Kmart. Justice O'Connor, whose status as the court's critical swing vote was solidified this year, provided the majority with its fifth vote in that case. But she was also the swing vote to uphold Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, a vital source of funds for legal services for the poor nationwide that was challenged by conservative legal groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This term showed just how far right the court's three most conservative members are. The dissent in the gay sex case -- by the chief justice, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- fulminated, like a talk show rant, about a ''homosexual agenda.'' But there is no equivalent core of justices on the left trying to push beyond the legal expression of mainstream American thought. No justice wrote separately to say the principles the court laid down offer support for gay marriage. On subjects from civil rights to criminal law, the ideological spectrum ranges from the far right on one side to liberal centrism on the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final week of the session, when the decisions on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the sodomy law came down, are sure to energize right-wing activists, who were already upset with the court's moderation and vowing to fill the next vacancy with another Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398441227.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Affirmative reaction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Court cases percolate all over America, but California has staked out political leadership of the drive to take the spoils out of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efforts there are occurring on three fronts -- at the University of California, in the legislature and through the initiative process. None, however, is assured of success.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who happens to be black and also a longtime friend of Gov. Pete Wilson, raised the issue of admissions quotas again last month, attracting considerable media attention. Mr. Connerly, who last year objected because some minority-group members apparently were \"admitted almost solely on the basis of race\" to the prestigious university's medical schools, this time widened his focus to the undergraduate enrollment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the June regents meeting, he asked administrators to consider alternatives to race-based admissions and to review federal laws and regulations that may constrain the UC. Mr. Connerly's direction, however, is clear: He doesn't like masked forms of \"government redistribution that takes from one and gives to another.\" He wants, instead, to \"market\" the university to groups that are underrepresented in the student body and assist them in preparing for application. As far as race and sex are concerned, that'd be it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Connerly makes his living as a consultant to public agencies and other entities, especially those concerned with land use, which is what brought him and Mr. Wilson together when they both worked in the statehouse two decades ago. He says he has never used minority set-asides to get contracts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Mr. Connerly's been a rather lonely voice on the regents. \"We need to put a little fiber in people who don't want to be perceived as racists or Uncle Toms,\" he says of his fellow board members, nearly all of them appointed by Republican governors. \"We're now at the point where the returns we're getting from this (preference policy) are little, but they come at a very high price.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That cost is the increasing bitterness of white and Asian-heritage students who find that merit isn't enough in what was long an objective process. On the other side, however, adamant defenders of quotas will spare nothing to defend their beachhead at the UC. In recent years, the legislature has passed mandates that the state universities admit in proportion with California's ethnic distribution. (They were vetoed.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legislative politics on this issue may be changing, as bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring and contracting now should get a fuller hearing. The main reason for this is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment flatly outlawing quotas that looms for the 1996 ballot. The legislature, still controlled by Democrats, may wish to pass statutes that steal some of the initiative's thunder while mucking up its succinct clarity with lots of lawyer-like language. Still, the citizen measure's sponsors are willing to go as far in the Capitol as they can.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, they will have to proceed to collect 615,000 valid signatures for a ballot placement next year. While many are predicting a polarizing and victorious campaign that will change the agenda of both state and national races, the fact is that backers face a daunting task. They will need about $1 million to qualify, and then will be up against an opposition including businesses that rely on quotas for their income.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By contrast, supporters are cash poor. Major corporations will sit this one out, fearing a public-relations hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story of the failed California voucher campaign of 1993 is a reminder of how an underfunded proposal is susceptible to an expensive campaign of harassment and distortion. On the other hand, Proposition 187 this past fall, despite its faults, proved that an inherently popular, grass-roots drive (with gubernatorial support) can win against loud opposition. The Civil Rights Initiative has going for it, at least so far, the quiet support of many moderate Democrats who grasp what the racial wedge is now doing to their party and their society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In sum, the California ferment stems from a bid to reclaim <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>'s original standing: It is a way to boost those who need help competing on what is, at the point of competition, a level field. It's an attempt to pull the idea back from its current emphasis on institutional mandates and return the focus to where it belongs -- on individual achievement.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 35s "}}
