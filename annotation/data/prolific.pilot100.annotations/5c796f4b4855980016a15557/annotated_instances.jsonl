The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imagination. Case closed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, as just about everyone who lives between Manhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening newscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74% of Republicans spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47% of Democrats agreed, believing that \"most journalists are more liberal than they are.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of course, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the news and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. They're denying it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them if there's a liberal bias on their newscasts, they'd all say \"no\" and they'd all pass the test.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . . [a] negative sign on you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words \"left wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with with the anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> or pro-life lobbies?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media elites can float through their personal lives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealthy and sometimes downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the brilliant film critic at The New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Nixon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: \"Nobody I know voted for Nixon.\" Never mind that Nixon carried 49 states. She wasn't kidding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on liberal bias it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and Peter: Stop telling us that we're the problem, and start thinking about what liberal bias really means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Goldberg was a correspondent for CBS News from 1972 until 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Reporters Need Course In Basic Capitalism\" -- WSJ June 5, 2001)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 55s "}}

The historic ruling settled a 1997 class-action lawsuit initiated by more than 1,000 black farmers that charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The settlement requires the USDA to provide at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who it agrees were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. One provision of the agreement also requires the federal government to return foreclosed lands to affected farmers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>African-Americans were 14 percent of American farmers in 1920 and today they are far less than 1 percent, according to John Boyd Jr., of the National Black Farmers Association. Boyd and other black farmers blame the USDA's discriminatory practices for that rapid land loss and several federal probes of the agency have supported those charges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1982 study by the Civil Rights Commission predicted that black farmers would be extinct by 2000 unless drastic action were taken by the federal government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the 1.4 million people who operated or managed farms in 1995, just 8,000 were black, according to recent figures from the Census Bureau.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Total claims in the recent settlement are expected to exceed $375 million, but the exact figure is impossible to calculate until officials have a better idea of the number of affected farmers. The lawsuit sought $3.5 billion and many farmers are complaining that the settlement is too little too late to be of any real assistance. Despite the inadequacies of the specific settlement, however, it provides the rationale for a more extensive claim of reparations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black farmers initiated the litigation in 1997 after an internal USDA investigation found an entrenched history of anti-black practices, reaffirming what many previous probes concluded. Although the lawsuit focused specifically on the period from 1981 to 1996, it could well have picked any period in American history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The suit argued that the current economic inequities of black farmers--as a \"class\"--are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias and that financial compensation helps redress the legacy of that history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That logic also justifies reparations as compensation to African- Americans--as a \"class\"--to help redress 2 1/2 centuries of slavery, a century of official apartheid and decades of de facto discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The accumulation of disadvantages blacks suffered during this period--including a coercive diversion of wealth and cultural capital--provide a compelling explanation for current wealth and health disparities between black and white Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In attempts to redress the damage of that history, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has continuously reintroduced, since 1989, a bill designed to examine slavery's impact on African-Americans. His bill, The Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act, has failed to garner sufficient support and languished in the House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arguments favoring reparations not only are logical, they also offer a welcome respite from the acrimonious debates about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other preference policies. The cost of federal reparations would be spread throughout the tax system and would be justified by both a cold economic calculus and moral responsibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sense of responsibility, for example, helps explain why few Germans complain about their country's payments of more than $100 billion to Israel in reparations for damage done to Jewish victims during the Nazi era.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the federal government issued land as reparations for racism was during Reconstruction, when Gen. O. O. Howard of the Freedmen's Bureau urged ex-slaves be granted \"40 acres and a mule.\" His suggestion was implemented on a tiny scale for a short time only on the Sea Islands, off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, but became a catch phrase for former slaves and their descendants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, halted that experiment in reparations with polices that ended Reconstruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bill Clinton hailed the recent settlement with his administration as an important step in ongoing efforts \"to redress any harm that has been caused by past discrimination against African- American family farmers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How ironic that the second president to be impeached has effectively resumed that experiment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: Salim4x@aol.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Margaret Scott.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is not mentioned.": "3"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}

Amid a campaign-contributions maelstrom, they name a person -- the director of the White House Office of Public Liaison -- who is almost certainly at or near the eye of the storm (yes, we know, she was oblivious to it all, never came in contact, etc.). Now comes evidence of the rankest sort of quota-mongering by the person nominated to head one of the nation's most work-force-sensitive offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House tells us that the chart below was part of a larger memo created for and \"in consultation with\" a working group headed by Ms. Herman during her White House tenure. The memo is titled \"Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996.\" Its existence was first reported by two weeklies, the Forward and Human Events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, it is obviously appropriate for the White House to reach out to the African-American community, and aggressively, in a Presidential campaign. What is striking about this chart is the programmatic mind-set it displays. Indeed, the chart is of a piece with the very same sort of document that in August laid out specific quota assignments for delegates to the Democratic convention -- \"adopt and implement <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs with specific goals and timetables for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans and women\" (Review & Outlook, \"The Quota Convention,\" 8/26/96).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exculpatory response to all this might be that the Democrats' internal political arrangements are their own business. We agree. The more compelling image to emerge from these practices, however, is that of a party in thrall to its constituent factions' demands, no matter what moderate rhetoric is put out for broader public consumption. Indeed, it was widely reported that Mr. Clinton was under enormous post-election pressure in naming his Cabinet from \"women\" and \"labor\" and \"minorities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet once Ms. Herman is Secretary Herman we're supposed to believe that all this Democratic reality goes away, that the operative theory is \"mend it, don't end it,\" and that in its formal submissions to the Labor Department Texaco won't have to produce a chart just like the one Alexis Herman generated for the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cases like Texaco's show, the 1990s are turning out to be the decade in which our national controversy over race moves beyond the academy to reside in the corporation. Along with the EEOC, the Labor Department is at center stage. Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regularly polices most Fortune 500 companies on their <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> practices; through the federal contract connection, Labor has the power to regulate more than half of the economy. Precisely for these reasons, the Labor Secretary's job should go to someone with great judgment and sensitivity, two traits not obviously in evidence in this nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 32s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409108213.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Two Little Words: (1) Advice, (2) Consent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives believe that every word of the Constitution should be \"strictly construed\" according to its \"plain meaning\" and the \"original intent\" of the men who wrote it. Every word, that is, except two: \"advice\" and \"consent.\" The plain meaning of these words is not hard to fathom, nor is their authors' intent. Senatorial \"advice and consent\" on the president's judicial nominations was a compromise between those who thought the president should appoint judges and those who thought Congress should do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least when the White House is Republican and the Senate is Democratic, however, conservatives discover all sorts of doctrines in the word \"consent\" that are far from clear to the naked eye. Senators musn't consider the nominee's ideology. They must never ask or consider how the nominee might vote on specific issues or cases. As for the word \"advice,\" fuggedabadit. At Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Tuesday about standards for approving judicial nominations, all the energy on the conservative side was about piling limitations on the Senate's power of consent. Only a liberal suggested that maybe the Constitution is trying to tell us that presidents should seek the Senate's advice in choosing his nominees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's straighten out a few concepts here. Ideology can mean the sum of your views on all political issues: welfare, taxes, trade with China, etc. Yes, of course, senators should not consider a would-be judge's politics -- except to ensure as best they can that the judge won't consider them either in his or her rulings. But ideology can also mean your specific philosophy on judicial matters: the role of precedent, the meaning of the 14th Amendment, and so on. And senators of course can and should inquire about this kind of ideology and vote yea or nea on that basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives generally accept this distinction. But they muddle it by presenting their own preferred judicial ideology -- a flurry of bromidic phrases: \"judicial restraint,\" \"strict construction,\" \"original intent\" -- as a piety beyond legitimate dispute. So any liberal challenge to a conservative nominee is automatically \"ideological\" in the bad sense, while every conservative challenge to a liberal nominee is based on philosophical principle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conservatives' judicial philosophy is not beyond legitimate dispute. First of all, they themselves happily overlook it when it is inconvenient. \"Advice and consent\" is a ripe example. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is another: Conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn policies of the elected branches. They sincerely believe, no doubt, that this is a case where the Constitution speaks clearly and judicial restraint is inappropriate. But that's the point: Their buzzwords don't provide an unfailing guide even for them, let alone a beacon of truth so bright that the path it illuminates is the only one worth taking. Waving a wand called \"strict construction\" can't fully illuminate purposely vague phrases like \"cruel and unusual.\" Invoking \"original intent\" won't tell you what the authors' original intent was about dealing with changing circumstances.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If \"advice and consent\" is entitled to anything close to its plain, original meaning, the Senate is perfectly entitled to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject some on that basis. Scrutiny includes asking nominees their views and their reasoning about fairly specific legal issues, if not actual pending cases. Why not? After all, sitting judges write long opinions day after day telling us what they think about many issues that will come up again, but no one regards that as a problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Needless to say, it would be wrong for Senate Democrats to let considerations of sauce for the gander influence their thinking on this issue. President Bush would never let political considerations influence his judicial choices. When he campaigned last fall on a promise to nominate justices like Scalia and Thomas, he must have had in mind some other way in which those two gentlemen are alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for eight years of Republican harassment and blocking of President Clinton's nominees, Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed at Tuesday's hearing that this is entirely a figment of your imagination. That's right -- it never happened! His \"proof\": almost as many Clinton nominees as Reagan nominees ultimately got confirmed. Of course this says nothing one way or another about how many were blocked and had to be replaced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clint Bolick, director of legal affairs for the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy and head of the so-called Institute for Justice, also testified on Tuesday. Bolick noted that his organization didn't oppose any of Clinton's Supreme Court nominees. He did not mention his ferocious campaign against Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's nominee for head of civil rights at the Justice Department. Ordinarily, a president's choices for his own administration are thought to deserve more deference, not less, than his nominations for lifetime appointments to the independent judiciary. But an Institute of Justice press release at the time (1997 again) argued that the advice and consent clause actually obliges senators to oppose nominees with erroneous views \"when the stakes are high enough.\" The stakes in this case were in essence that Bolick's group favored judicial activism -- judges overthrowing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> plans -- and Lee did not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Institute of Justice Web site describes it as dedicated to opposing \"racial preferences\" and \"the welfare state\" and as a \"courtroom champion\" for \"free market solutions and limited government.\" But Bolick testified Tuesday that \"mere philosophical differences\" shouldn't play a role in the Senate's approval of judges -- and, what's more, they never had. To start now would be \"a sea change,\" he said. Bolick quoted Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy in 1997 denouncing the practice of \"blue slipping\" -- individual senators blocking judicial nominees from their state. He didn't explain why Leahy should be so upset about something that didn't exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate (www.slate.com), writes a weekly column for The Post.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 18s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408354994.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The University of Michigan Case</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JENNIFER GRATZ'S lawsuit challenging the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy is a win-win proposition for opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs and a significant headache for their defenders. If Ms. Gratz prevails in the lower courts, the university could be forced to dismantle its program, joining public universities in California and Texas that have adopted race-blind admissions policies and then seen minority enrollments plummet. On the other hand, if Ms. Gratz loses, foes of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will have the opportunity to challenge the race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court at a time when the high court is notably unfriendly to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> generally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Gratz, who is represented pro bono by the conservative Center for Individual Rights, claims she was discriminated against when she was wait-listed and later turned down by Michigan two years ago because she is white. On its face, she appears to have a strong case. University admissions guidelines seem to instruct admissions officers to handle minority applications differently from those of white applicants, laying out a dual set of standards that could raise a constitutional problem under the Supreme Court's 1978 case University of California Regents v. Bakke. In Bakke, the court allowed race to be a factor in admissions but said it could not preclude any candidate from receiving full consideration. That is precisely what Ms. Gratz alleges happened to her, because the guidelines suggest that comparably qualified minority candidates generally should be admitted. These are disturbing guidelines, and it is significant that the university has since changed its admissions system to one that would be easier to defend under Bakke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, it would be premature to pass judgment on a complex admissions system before all the evidence is in. It is difficult to demonstrate that any one student was rejected because of race as opposed to the myriad other factors that influence admissions at a large university, and the University of Michigan gives preferential treatment to students on bases other than race. Students from certain counties in Michigan get preferential treatment, for example, as do students whose parents are Michigan alumni. It is not logical to suggest that race can be a factor in admissions but can never play a decisive role in an individual admissions decision. Even a program that meets the Bakke test, in other words, is going to produce certain white victims -- like, perhaps, Ms. Gratz -- so the mere fact that such victims exist cannot necessarily mean that the program is constitutionally deficient.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The larger question, of course, is whether Bakke even remains the law of the land. Normally, the courts wait for the Supreme Court to renounce one of its own rulings before declaring the ruling dead. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit paid the high court no such deference when it ruled last year that the University of Texas could not use race as a factor in law school admissions. This was, in our judgment, a bad decision that jumped the gun on an important constitutional question. But it is also possible that the decision in Hopwood v. Texas correctly anticipated the direction that the Supreme Court, which declined to review the case, eventually will go on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in education. It is not obvious that this will be the case, however. While the court has narrowed the acceptable uses of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in recent years, the public university is a unique environment -- constitutionally as well as culturally. Allowing a university to foster diversity by factoring race into admissions decisions under certain narrow circumstances still seems to be a constitutional approach.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}

We hunger for purpose at a moment when faith, patriotism and hard work are on the decline. We embrace secular religions like climatism, Covidism and gender ideology to satisfy our need for meaning, yet we can't answer what it means to be an American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party's top priority should be to fill this void with an inspiring national identity that dilutes the woke agenda to irrelevance. Instead, many top Republicans recite slogans they memorized in 1980 or criticize left-wing culture without offering an alternative. To put America first, we need to rediscover what America is. That's why I am running for president. I am launching not only a political campaign but a cultural movement to create a new American Dream -- one that is not only about money but about the unapologetic pursuit of excellence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may seem presumptuous for a 37-year-old political outsider to pursue the highest office in the land, but I am running on a vision for our nation -- one that revives merit in every sphere of American life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit for who gets to come to America. My parents entered this country legally, worked hard and raised two kids who went on to create businesses that improved the lives of thousands of Americans. We need more immigrants like them, instead of those who break the law when they enter our country. That means securing the border unapologetically and eliminating lottery-based immigration in favor of meritocratic admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must embrace merit in who gets to succeed in America. The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn racial preferences in college admissions. As president I will eliminate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> across the American economy. Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 mandates that federal contractors -- which employ approximately 20% of the U.S. workforce -- adopt race-based hiring preferences. Top companies now regularly disfavor qualified applicants who happen to be white or Asian-American, which spawns resentment and condescension toward black and Hispanic hires. I will rescind this executive order and direct the Justice Department to prosecute illegal race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must revive merit in who gets to govern in America. Democracy depends on a simple principle: The people we elect to run the government must be the people who actually run the government. The next time unelected bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci or Merrick Garland reach beyond their legal scope, I commit to doing what the president is constitutionally empowered to do: fire them. I will repeal civil-service protections for federal employees, by executive order if necessary, and replace these managerial protections with sunset clauses. If the president can't hold his position for more than eight years, neither should most bureaucrats. I will call on Congress to repeal or amend the 1974 Impoundment Control Act and will stop funding agencies that waste money or have outlived their purpose. I will shut down agencies that can't be reformed and create new ones built from scratch to replace them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit in determining which ideas win in America. The best ideas are born when no ideas are censored. Yet our government pressures technology companies to censor disfavored political speech and gives them special protections to carry it out. Internet companies are bound by the First Amendment when they act in concert with state actors. As Elon Musk did at Twitter, I will release the \"state action files\" from the federal government -- publicly exposing every known instance in which bureaucrats have wrongfully pressured companies to take constitutionally prohibited actions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Viewpoint censorship extends beyond the internet and pervades our economy. If you can't fire someone for being black, gay or Muslim, you shouldn't be able to fire someone for his political speech. I will work with Congress to enshrine political expression as an American civil right, and I will enforce existing civil-rights laws to protect workers from invidious viewpoint discrimination. The federal prohibition on religious discrimination forbids employers from forcing employees to bow down to any religion, including secular ones as defined by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Seeger (1965) and Torcaso v. Watkins (1961). The modern woke agenda in much of corporate America fits that bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once we revive our national identity around shared principles, we can muster the fortitude needed to defeat the greatest external threat to America: the rise of communist China. Unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, China today powers the modern American way of life. We must declare economic independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must reclaim global energy leadership by rejecting the demands of a new climate religion that shackles the U.S. and leaves China untouched. We must achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency while vigorously protecting Taiwan. We should prohibit kids under 16 from using TikTok. We must use financial levers to hold China accountable for spawning the Covid-19 pandemic. We must even be willing to bar U.S. companies from expanding into China until its government abandons theft and other mercantilist tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can rise to this occasion if we rediscover who we really are. America's strength isn't our diversity but the ideals that unify us across our differences. These ideals won the American Revolution, reunited us after the Civil War, won two World Wars and the Cold War. They still give hope to the free world. If we can revive them, nothing will defeat us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramaswamy is a co-founder of Strive Asset Management and author, most recently, of \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence\" and \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Ramaswamy for President?

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/431248074.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>One Internet, Two Nations</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department at Harvard University, is co-editor of Encarta Africana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Stono Rebellion of 1739 in South Caroli na the largest uprising of slaves in the colonies before the American Revolution -- legislators there responded by banishing two forms of communication among the slaves: the mastery of reading and writing, and the mastery of ''talking drums,'' both of which had been crucial to the capacity to rebel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the next century and a half, access to literacy became for the slaves a hallmark of their humanity and an instrument of liberation, spiritual as well as physical. The relation between freedom and literacy became the compelling theme of the slave narratives, the great body of printed books that ex-slaves generated to assert their common humanity with white Americans and to indict the system that had oppressed them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the years since the abolition of slavery, the possession of literacy has been a cardinal value of the African-American tradition. It is no accident that the first great victory in the legal battle over segregation was fought on the grounds of education -- of equal access to literacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, blacks are failing to gain access to the new tools of literacy: the digital ''knowledge economy.'' And while the dilemma that our ancestors confronted was imposed by others, this cybersegregation is, to a large degree, self-imposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Government's latest attempt to understand why low-income African-Americans and Hispanics are slower to embrace the Internet and the personal computer than whites -- the Commerce Department study ''Falling Through the Net'' -- suggests that income alone can't be blamed for the so-called digital divide. For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms. Net promoters are concerned that the digital divide threatens to become a 21st century poll tax that, in effect, disenfranchises a third of the nation. Our children, especially, need access not only to the vast resources that technology offers for education, but also to the rich cultural contexts that define their place in the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today we stand at the brink of becoming two societies, one largely white and plugged in and the other black and unplugged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the most tragic aspects of slavery was the way it destroyed social connections. In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls ''social death,'' slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illustration (Stephen Doyle)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 11s "}}

Northern Virginia today offers a snapshot of how <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, intended as a benevolent effort to prevent discrimination, has hardened into an ugly war on achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest fuss was kicked off before Christmas when Asra Nomani, an India-born mom and reporter, wrote a piece for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal detailing how her son's Virginia high school never informed him he'd been recognized by the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology -- known as \"TJ\" and regularly ranked America's No. 1 high school -- said they had the same experience. So Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation on Jan. 4. Days later, principals at two more Fairfax County high schools, Westfield and Langley, admitted they too had failed to inform student award winners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Miyares then expanded his investigation to all Fairfax County. No sooner had he done so than neighboring Loudoun County reported that three of its high schools had delayed notifying its students -- though officials insisted it wasn't intentional. On Friday, four more Fairfax high schools fessed up, followed by another on Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Merit Scholarship Program is a competition of 1.5 million students, based on their scores on the Preliminary Standard Achievement Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. \"Commended Students\" rank in the top 3%, while \"Semifinalists\" test in the top 1%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's an achievement that can make a difference on a college or scholarship application. But the kids who weren't told they were National Merit winners, or were told too late, couldn't include it on their applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given that the program leaves notifications up to the individual schools, it's possible that all these failures were bureaucratic snafus. But the context offers a less generous reading. Public education in Fairfax County has become the front line for an equity agenda that has hardened into a war on achievers, who are disproportionately Asian-American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a federal judge pointed out in 2022 in a case contesting TJ's new admissions policy, the Fairfax County School Board eliminated the merit-based entrance exam to make room for African-American and Hispanic students by reducing the number of Asian-Americans. In that sense it \"worked.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The class admitted before the change was 73.05% Asian-American, 3.29% Hispanic and 1.23% African-American. After the change, these figures went to 54.36%, 11.27% and 7.09%, respectively. The share of white students grew from 17.70% to 22.36%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meantime, in October district officials signed a $455,000 contract for strategic planning with consultant Mutiu Fagbayi of Performance Fact Inc. A PowerPoint presentation he'd already delivered at a September 2022 Fairfax County School Board retreat defines equity as \"equal outcomesfor every student,without exception.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or consider Shawnna Yashar, another TJ mom, whose son wasn't told he was a commended student until after the deadline for his early admissions application. Ms. Yashar says that when she complained to TJ's director of student services, Brandon Kosatka, he told her that the school wants \"to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,\" and that it delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of those who didn't qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard not to notice that those who paid the price for this approach were overwhelmingly Asian-American, judging by the names on the National Merit Semifinalists' list published by Fairfax County. Asian-Americans at TJ accounted for 101 of the 132 winners, or 77%. At Langley it was 10 of 15 (66%), and for Westfield it was four of five (80%).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asian-Americans make up only 18.97% of the student population of the Fairfax County public schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes Asian-American achievement so resented by our equity warriors is that it exposes as false the narrative about an irredeemably racist America where minorities can't succeed. This progressive disdain for Asian-Americans is amplified by a resentment of moms and dads who believe they should have a say in their kids' educations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Virginia, parents watched teachers unions agitate to keep classrooms closed during Covid. They learned the National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration to regard angry parents who showed up to public meetings demanding accountability as domestic terrorists. And they heard a schools superintendent in Loudoun County lying to them about a brutal sexual assault of a 15-year-girl in a school bathroom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now these same officials want parents, especially Asian-American parents, to believe that not informing their children that they won a prestigious academic competition was an innocent oversight. We'll see what the attorney general finds. But nothing these school officials have done has earned them a presumption of trust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is not mentioned.": "3"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}

But right now Bradley should not distract attention from Al Gore, whose difficulties multiply. And Bradley's recent foray into the politics of ideas did not make sensible people impatient for his next foray.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore knows that serving vice presidents who have wanted their parties' nominations have succeeded recently (Nixon in 1960, Humphrey in 1968, Bush in 1988). However, Bush in 1988 was the first incumbent vice president since Van Buren in 1836 to win the presidency. Bush won partly because a contented electorate wanted the closest thing to a third Reagan term. Not many voters next year are going to be thinking, \"Gosh, it would be really neat to prolong the Clinton years!\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats worry about polls that show George W. Bush, about whom voters know little, handily beating Gore in places like Michigan. This in the record 97th month of peacetime economic expansion. And Gore keeps saying strange things. Never mind his I-was-a- hardscrabble-farmer and his I-invented-the-Internet riffs. Consider two recent beauties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pressed by some environmentalists to support aggressive measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and coal-burning power plants, Gore responded that he's on their side, but challenged them: \"Name a senator who would support me.\" Does it occur to him that there might be something wrong with an agenda opposed by 100 senators?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently Gore, speaking of his book \"Earth in the Balance,\" told Time magazine: \"There's not a statement in that book that I don't endorse. Not one. The evidence has firmed up the positions I sketched there.\" Oh? What fresh evidence confirms that ours is a \"dysfunctional civilization\"? Or that automobiles pose \"a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again likely to confront\"? Should we then be bombing Detroit instead of Serbia?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The certitude that Gore radiates carries an undercurrent of moral preening -- the suggestion that people who come to different conclusions are morally as well as intellectually flawed. On the evidence of Bradley's recent speech on race, he can match Gore stride for stride in the sanctimony sweepstakes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's speech at Cooper Union in Manhattan was long on earnestness. We all should \"look deeper into the soul of America\" and pursue \"racial healing\" which is thwarted by \"white indifference and black suspicion\" and \"the deadwood of superstition, fear and fantasy.\" Many white Americans \"harbor absurd stereotypes about all people of color.\" We need \"candid talk.\" And so on.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is familiar. On July 10, 1991, in a remarkably unpleasant \"open letter\" to President Bush, Bradley accused Bush of hypocrisy and of \"shamelessly\" engaging in \"race-baiting.\" On July 16, 1991, Bradley implicitly praised himself for \"speaking candidly\" and for the \"moral courage\" to avoid \"easy evasions\" about race by faulting others for not speaking as he does. His \"candid talk\" included falsely accusing Ronald Reagan of saying that \"all female black Americans are welfare queens.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He even left the impression that the surge of murders among young blacks after 1984 was the result of Republican presidents, not crack cocaine. On April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots following the initial acquittal of the police in the Rodney King case, Bradley again described America as \"a society that does not talk honestly about race.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's belief that Americans are not sufficiently and properly preoccupied with race may resonate among Democratic activists. Many of them endorse identity politics, the theory that individuals are decisively shaped and irrevocably defined not by reasoned choices but by accidents of birth and socialization -- by membership in a racial, ethnic or sexual group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, it is arguable that identity politics, and obsessing about race, is a plague. Bradley wants to \"overcome our divisions\" and \"get to a time when, in Toni Morrison's words, `race exists, but it doesn't matter.' \" But his self-advertised candor does not extend to even considering the possibility that reaching such a time is made more difficult by some things Democrats cherish -- <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, categorical representation (the theory that the interests of a group can only be understood and represented by members of that group) and the rest of the racial spoils system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley cannot hope -- who can? -- to beat Gore in the sanctimony sweepstakes. So he should avoid implying that America's failure to measure up to his standard of racial honesty results not from honest differences of opinions among decent people, but from the moral inadequacies of those who do not share his opinions.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is not mentioned.": "3"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}

When was the last time a President had called together the press secretaries of all the departments? What did he want? He marched in, big, brown-suited and angry, and told them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was tired, he said, of being compared unfavorably with John Kennedy, especially on civil rights. JFK had a fine record, he said.  But so, dammit, did he. ''Some day,'' he thundered, ''you'll tell your grandchildren you were proud to have been part of the Johnson Administration.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His words came to mind last week when Morris Abram testified on his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The testimony, like Lyndon Johnson's civil rights record, turns on one of the great unsettled issues of our time: <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It underlies almost every aspect of modern race relations - and it remains open as America struggles over how much to do to relieve the enduring effects of slavery and bigotry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Morris Abram is a lifelong enemy of that bigotry. To imply otherwise does injustice to a man of public, and private, courage.  But the respect due a man of principle need not extend to his every principle. And when it comes to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, the position he enunciated again last week is technical, bloodless, uncharacteristically ungenerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To him, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is permissible only if neutral. He believes ''it is morally and legally wrong to discrimate against any person or to discriminate in favor of any person.'' To do otherwise is to concur in ''governmentally enforced quotas.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quotas offend him deeply because Racism Is Different.  So Is the Case For Preference the power to prefer one group today is the power to prefer another tomorrow. Other aggrieved minorities, including white ethnic groups, will demand special treatment, setting the stage ''for conflict - and tragedy.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do other minorities have grounds for complaint? Of course. American life is punctuated with signs that read ''No Irish Need Apply'' or with anti-Jewish quotas at medical schools. But Mr. Abram evidently finds it hard to distinguish these grievances from the relentless racism of centuries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even conceding that, Mr. Abram still thinks it wrong for government to give preference to one group. Yet government does that all the time. As Justice Blackmun observed in the Bakke case, government regularly gives preferences to veterans, the handicapped, Indians and, with the progressive income tax, to many others. ''In order to get beyond racism,'' he wrote, ''we must first take account of race.  There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's every reason for the present generation of Americans to try conscientiously to redress the enduring wrongs of our past. And, if we want more than proclamations of virtue, we need a way of keeping score.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Abram does not oppose remedial action. He insists that he is for, if not <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, at least ''social assistance.'' For instance, he would provide job training to all who would work but lack the skills. But then why shrink from devising ways to open up jobs, too? To Mr. Abram, that raises the hateful idea of quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Attaching numbers to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> need not - should not - mean guaranteed numerical outcomes. It is a way to make institutions accountable, to measure their honest efforts to find minority employees, students, applicants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Abram is entitled to his chilly neutrality. What he is not entitled to do is cite Lyndon Johnson in its defense. If one really wants to know what Lyndon Johnson thought of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, head and heart, one should recall his words at Howard University in 1965, words that have not been improved on since:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Freedom is not enough ...You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been competely fair. Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates ....</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough. Men and women of all races are born with the same range of abilities. But ability is not just the product of birth ...It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child, and finally the man.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Freedom is not enough, Mr. Abram. Equal opportunity is not enough.  Neither is neutrality.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
