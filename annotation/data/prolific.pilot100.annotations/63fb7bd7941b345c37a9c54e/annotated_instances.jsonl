It needs a renewed emphasis on its founding spirit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WEDNESDAY MARKS the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice, which is both auspicious and, to many Americans, possibly surprising. Central as it is to American government, this Cabinet-level agency did not exist at the founding. There was little in the way of federal law, civil or criminal, until the Civil War. In the aftermath of that conflict, however, Congress established the department. The reformist purpose was to get rid of the expensive private attorneys \u2014 often party hacks \u2014 whom the federal government had previously hired to represent it, and to replace them with full-time professionals supervised by the attorney general. Simultaneously, Congress gave the department a new responsibility: to enforce the first-ever federal statutes designed to protect the civil rights of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Awareness of this history only compounds our dismay at the department's course under the Trump administration and the most recent attorney general, William P. Barr. Instead of impartiality and professionalism, there have been presidential interference with policy and personnel decisions and unjustified leniency for political favorites. Instead of an aggressive civil rights posture, there have been reluctance to investigate systemic violations by police departments, backing for lawsuits against <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions and, from Mr. Barr himself, support for a police sweep of nonviolent protesters in Lafayette Square to make room for President Trump to stage a photo op.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some partisanship, real and perceived, is inevitable given that the ultimate power over federal law enforcement resides with politicians in Congress and the White House. In that sense, creating the department in 1870 was, at best, a partial fix for a dilemma inherent to the Constitution. From the beginning, and increasingly since the mushrooming of federal law enforcement authority in the 20th century, critics have accused the Justice Department of undermining the rule of law rather than upholding it, as anyone familiar with the careers of A. Mitchell Palmer or John N. Mitchell \u2014 or even Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 knows. The troubling covert surveillance warrants against Trump supporter Carter Page belong on that list, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way to reduce the risk of politicized or otherwise abusive federal law enforcement may be to reduce the sheer scope of federal criminal law, which has become overgrown and duplicative. As part of criminal justice reform, Congress should trim the excess, consistent both with the Constitution's assignment of primary responsibility for crime control to the states, and with the efficiency-promoting aims of the department's founders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, though, a large role for the Justice Department must remain \u2014 the legitimacy of which will depend on the ethos of its leaders, up to and including the president. Despite its imperfections, this is an indispensable institution; its career staff represents a vital national repository of public-spirited talent. These officials embody the legacy of reform and heightened independence in the post-Watergate years \u2014 a period that provides a hopeful precedent for today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than new policies or procedures, the Justice Department needs rededication to its founding spirit \u2014 professionalism and impartiality \u2014 and renewed emphasis on its oldest mission: civil rights. The Trump administration has shown itself incapable of that rededication. The next president and attorney general will have to do the job, urgently.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 36s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408654746.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Mr. Lieberman's Debut</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOSEPH LIEBERMAN introduced himself to the American people last night, and was introduced by his wife and others, as a classic American story--the first in his family to graduate from college, the son of a father who worked nights and a mother who valued family and education. Much has been made of his status as the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president, but his message was the universality of the American dream and of the values that motivate him--faith, family, hard work, public service, equal opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was an affecting speech, well received in the convention hall. But the senator's challenge went beyond making a good first impression. Some of the very qualities that recommended him to Al Gore also represent sources of tension now that he is on the ticket. His reputation for integrity stems in part from his criticism of Clinton-Gore fundraising excesses and of President Clinton's ethical lapses. His reputation for innovative thinking and bipartisanship stems in part from questioning policies that remain sacrosanct in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Since his selection, the George Bush campaign has even portrayed Mr. Lieberman as closer to its views than to Mr. Gore's--somehow not a real Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So last night Mr. Lieberman portrayed himself as very much in the mainstream of Democratic thinking. He wrapped himself in the language of civil rights and a fair distribution of national prosperity. Whatever differences he might have with some Democrats, he seemed to say--or with Al Gore--pale next to differences between the parties. In so doing, he glossed over some of his past independent stands. There was no mention of President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal, which the senator bravely criticized in the past, nor of the fundraising coffees at the White House, which Mr. Gore attended. Likewise, he endorsed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which he has questioned, and was mute on tort reform or school vouchers, two policies that Mr. Lieberman has sympathized with. Tort reform is anathema to the trial bar, which donates lavishly to Democratic campaign coffers. School vouchers appall the teachers' unions; teachers account for some 12 percent of the delegates at the convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Sen. Lieberman emphasized areas in which he and Mr. Gore agree, such as health care, the Democrats' favorite issue this year. He sought to draw a distinction between Democrats and Gov. George W. Bush on the environment. He warned that the Republicans' tax plans would benefit the wealthy, slighting Social Security and Medicare. And on the crusade against indecency in popular culture, not popular in Hollywood, he claimed kinship with Al and Tipper Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lieberman in the past has been refreshingly willing to acknowledge the complexities of issues such as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and the failings of public schools. One question now is whether the Gore ticket can offer new ideas without venturing outside the confines imposed by the Democratic Party's core constituents. Education is a test case, even though the federal role in this area is limited. Mr. Lieberman avoided the radioactive subject of vouchers, but he did declare that \"schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability.\" That may prove more radical than it sounds, depending on how it translates into policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats have held the White House for two terms in part by convincing Americans that they are the party that fights, as Mr. Lieberman said last night, to find \"room for everybody\" around the table of American prosperity. But they also have succeeded by separating themselves enough from their traditional positions to look fresh. They have become the party of fiscal responsibility and are willing to see that government programs must be enlivened with new management styles (hence Mr. Gore's talk of reinventing government) and with competition (hence the Democrats' support for charter schools). This openness needs to be preserved. \"We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree,\" one speaker declared on Tuesday night. That speaker was Jesse Jackson, in some ways the champion of traditionalists.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}

Focusing only on racism will deflect attention from the economic problems poor people of color face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the president says he wants to lead Americans \"in a great and unprecedented conversation about race,\" it appears his primary goal is to marshal support for <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> \"has given us a whole new generation of professionals in fields that used to be exclusive clubs,\" Clinton said in announcing his initiative. \"There are more African American, Latino and Asian American lawyers and judges, scientists and engineers, accountants and executives than ever before.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs have opened the way for more people of color to join the middle class, and that is a good thing. But such programs have done little for people of color who are members of the working and poverty classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, the successes of middle- and upper-class people of color can benefit poor people of color in indirect ways, like providing positive role models and weakening negative racial stereotypes. Furthermore, because middle-class people of color still face many disadvantages (bigotry, racially biased standardized tests, etc.) when competing against middle-class whites, some form of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is still needed. But the experience of the past three decades has shown that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs are no substitute for measures that would more directly address the effects of racism on poor people of color. In part, it is a story of how civil-rights organizations were co-opted into losing their focus on helping poor people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act concluded the struggle for political and legal rights, civil rights leaders searched for new strategies to continue their struggle against racism. During the Mississippi March Against Fear in 1966, Willie Ricks, a staff member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, discovered the powerful resonance of the phrase \"black power\" when delivering a speech. He told SNCC chairman Stokely Carmichael, who brought the term into popular consciousness at subsequent rallies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what was \"black power\"? Carmichael first defined it as black participation in politics to elect representatives more responsive to their needs. Later, he would identify American blacks as an exploited colony of the United States and attempt to link their struggle to the national liberation movements that flourished throughout the Third World after WWII.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the last word on the subject would not belong to Carmichael. In 1967, corporate interests, led by the Ford Foundation, became deeply involved in financing almost all major civil rights organizations. The co-optation of these organizations and the corporate-financed black-power conferences of 1967 and 1968 were instrumental in redefining \"black power\" as black capitalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The equation of \"black power\" with black capitalism forestalled the possibility of class-based black-liberation struggles and quickly gained the endorsement of corporate and government leaders. In a 1968 radio broadcast, President Richard M. Nixon expressed his approval of \"black power, in the best, the constructive sense of that often misapplied term . . . It's no longer enough that white-owned enterprises employ greater number of Negroes, whether as laborers or as middle-management personnel. This is needed, yes--but it has to be accompanied by an expansion of black ownership, of black capitalism.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The failure of black capitalism to end racism is self-evident, as is the need to combine a class analysis with an anti-racist one in order to understand the needs of poor people of color. Even conservative critics of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have made this point, arguing for class-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> policies as a better way of helping \"truly needy\" people of color. What remains to be seen is if these critics are sincere in their desire to help poor people of color or are merely searching for moral high ground from which to attack race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton's seven-member advisory panel must recognize that communities of color are not monolithic, that, like the rest of America, they are divided into economic classes with different problems and different needs. From here, the panel could build a consensus for a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism, not just defending race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> policies that have proved to be, at best, tokenistic and, at worst, little more than pacification efforts designed to prop up a fundamentally racist system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What would a more comprehensive approach entail? It might examine, for example, how de-industrialization has impoverished inner cities and how attacks on the \"liberal interventionist state,\" coupled with the resegregation of the country through \"white flight\" to the suburbs, have allowed middle-class white voters to tax themselves to pay for direct services while shielding their tax dollars from federal programs that might be used for urban renewal or to help poor people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such an analysis might suggest that the problems faced by people of color who are are forced to attend inferior schools in underfunded school districts could be eased if school funding was equalized through state or federal subsidies. This simple change would go a long way toward establishing the \"level playing field\" conservatives profess to champion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the very least, a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism should acknowledge that racism is experienced differently by members of different economic classes and therefore needs to be addressed through a variety of strategies. For example, middle- and working-class African Americans today experience racism most acutely in the form of racial discrimination and segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These problems were exacerbated by a series of rulings issued in 1989 by the Rehnquist court that undercut many of the civil rights protections people of color had gained under the Warren court in the 1960s and the Burger court in the 1970s and early 1980s. The rulings combined to make voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs more difficult to establish and easier to undo, increased the burden of proving employment discrimination and drastically diminished the ability of people of color to fight segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other legal impediments to desegregation include various loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The law is weak not only because it is not vigorously enforced, but also because some of its provisions exempt people who own or rent fewer than four single-family houses, the vast majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A more sympathetic Supreme Court, closing legal loopholes and vigorously enforcing anti-discrimination laws would help address the problem of racism within the middle and working classes. But legal changes are not likely to help members of the poverty class, whose circumstances are the result of structural changes in the economy. In the latter case, development of a broad-based employment-opportunity program that would include job creation, job training and free or subsidized child care is needed, not new dialogues about race relations. Opponents of government spending on such measures should consider that alternatives, such as building more prisons, are not without cost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...), VINCENT KIRSCH / for The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Novoa is a student in the ethnic studies PhD program at UC Berkeley and teaches ethnic studies for the Peralta Community College School District</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Strongly in favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}

These policies will downgrade academic qualifications (grades and test scores) and will include factors such as the students' athletic or artistic ability or struggle against poverty. The supporters of these changes say they will not use the new rules to promote raced-based admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real goal of the new guidelines is the elimination of the concepts of fairness and objectivity from the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is no accident that most colleges use the SAT and high school grades as the main criteria for admissions. These have been shown for decades to be the best predictors of scholastic performance. The SAT has the added advantage over grades in that everyone takes the same test and the test is scored the same way for everyone. The SAT is objective. It is blind to race, gender, age, politics, religion, national origin and sexual orientation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is precisely why the regents oppose it. They want the admissions process to be subjective. This means that hidden agendas can be brought into the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe that the new guidelines will not be politicized? UC Berkeley is one of the most left-wing schools in the country. Ability aside, who is more likely to get admitted there under the new \"flexible\" guidelines--the high school radical who claims that the attack on the World Trade Center was our fault or the conservative student who supports our right to self-defense?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe, despite explicit disclaimers to the contrary, that race will not be brought back as a factor in admissions?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May the regents voted to drop a 6-year-old ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Because state law prohibits <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in public hiring and admissions, the regents clearly were sending a message by their vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new criteria will serve to protect the university system against discrimination charges by academically qualified students of the wrong race. Previously, students who were discriminated against because of race could show that they should have been admitted because their test scores and grades were better than those who were admitted. If they took the case to court, they usually won. Now the university can say, \"We used a holistic procedure based on numerous factors that vary from student to student, and we decided that student X had a special combination of qualities that we wanted and student Y did not.\" Such subjective guidelines offer a rejected student no chance of winning in a court of law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The regents claim that the new guidelines will allow the admission of people with athletic ability. Whom are they trying to fool? For better or for worse, good athletes have been given preference in admissions to colleges and universities for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And how does a struggle against poverty, as admirable as that is, qualify one for college admission?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard C. Atkinson says that high school students can gain admittance if they work hard and take tough courses. But how can he promise such a thing if the new guidelines specifically de-emphasize academics? Under the new procedures, it is impossible for a student to know what to do to prepare for college. The new \"flexible\" criteria can be anything the admissions office wants. The ones to suffer the most will be precisely the intelligent, hard- working, high-achieving students who most deserve admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real motive for the new admissions criteria is egalitarianism. The regents cannot accept the fact that some people are more academically qualified than others so their solution is to undermine the concept of academic competence. If they succeed, both students and universities will be the worse for it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Edwin A.

The historic ruling settled a 1997 class-action lawsuit initiated by more than 1,000 black farmers that charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The settlement requires the USDA to provide at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who it agrees were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. One provision of the agreement also requires the federal government to return foreclosed lands to affected farmers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>African-Americans were 14 percent of American farmers in 1920 and today they are far less than 1 percent, according to John Boyd Jr., of the National Black Farmers Association. Boyd and other black farmers blame the USDA's discriminatory practices for that rapid land loss and several federal probes of the agency have supported those charges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1982 study by the Civil Rights Commission predicted that black farmers would be extinct by 2000 unless drastic action were taken by the federal government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the 1.4 million people who operated or managed farms in 1995, just 8,000 were black, according to recent figures from the Census Bureau.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Total claims in the recent settlement are expected to exceed $375 million, but the exact figure is impossible to calculate until officials have a better idea of the number of affected farmers. The lawsuit sought $3.5 billion and many farmers are complaining that the settlement is too little too late to be of any real assistance. Despite the inadequacies of the specific settlement, however, it provides the rationale for a more extensive claim of reparations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black farmers initiated the litigation in 1997 after an internal USDA investigation found an entrenched history of anti-black practices, reaffirming what many previous probes concluded. Although the lawsuit focused specifically on the period from 1981 to 1996, it could well have picked any period in American history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The suit argued that the current economic inequities of black farmers--as a \"class\"--are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias and that financial compensation helps redress the legacy of that history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That logic also justifies reparations as compensation to African- Americans--as a \"class\"--to help redress 2 1/2 centuries of slavery, a century of official apartheid and decades of de facto discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The accumulation of disadvantages blacks suffered during this period--including a coercive diversion of wealth and cultural capital--provide a compelling explanation for current wealth and health disparities between black and white Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In attempts to redress the damage of that history, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has continuously reintroduced, since 1989, a bill designed to examine slavery's impact on African-Americans. His bill, The Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act, has failed to garner sufficient support and languished in the House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arguments favoring reparations not only are logical, they also offer a welcome respite from the acrimonious debates about <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and other preference policies. The cost of federal reparations would be spread throughout the tax system and would be justified by both a cold economic calculus and moral responsibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sense of responsibility, for example, helps explain why few Germans complain about their country's payments of more than $100 billion to Israel in reparations for damage done to Jewish victims during the Nazi era.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the federal government issued land as reparations for racism was during Reconstruction, when Gen. O. O. Howard of the Freedmen's Bureau urged ex-slaves be granted \"40 acres and a mule.\" His suggestion was implemented on a tiny scale for a short time only on the Sea Islands, off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, but became a catch phrase for former slaves and their descendants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Andrew Johnson, the only other president to be impeached, halted that experiment in reparations with polices that ended Reconstruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bill Clinton hailed the recent settlement with his administration as an important step in ongoing efforts \"to redress any harm that has been caused by past discrimination against African- American family farmers.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How ironic that the second president to be impeached has effectively resumed that experiment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: Salim4x@aol.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Margaret Scott.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}

Please recognize that for what it is, or be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For too long, the Chicago Fire Department has been a club for white guys, with the top jobs handed from grandfather to father to son.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't work anymore in a city that is mostly black and Latino.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It especially doesn't work when the city is run by a white mayor- for-life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But make no mistake, this appointment is about covering Daley's flank, not the Fire Department's flank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Daley controls minority politicians, he's got a problem coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This summer, Daley's friends, the Outfit-connected Duffs, will go on trial in federal court. A grand jury has charged that they fraudulently received $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts, though they were white guys.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In effect, they stole $100 million from black, Latino and female- owned firms. And I don't know how anyone can believe that $100 million in deals leaves City Hall without Daley's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So having Trotter and other minorities out front in high profile positions, getting TV time, can't hurt the mayor. It can only help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter, executive director of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, faces other political challenges too. The vast majority of 911 calls don't involve fires; they involve ambulance requests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This move reflects the changes in the department,\" said a paramedic commander who happens to be white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This is not about black and white, it's about paramedics and firefighters, and it's about time that our side of the department got some clout,\" he said. \"Trotter will give us that.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fire commissioner's job is political and administrative, yes. But it is also about fighting fires and saving lives, not only of fire victims, but also the lives of firefighters under his command.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has made the political decision that extensive fire command experience isn't necessary for the top fire job. If you've got questions on that front, take it up with him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tragic and needless deaths at the 69 W. Washington St. fire may be attributed to a lack of command experience by some fire bosses at the scene. If Trotter had been commissioner then and it was found he had little if any fire command experience, he'd be the one forced to resign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a paramedic, Trotter will have to earn the respect of firefighters. As a black man, he has decided to push affirmative- action policies while dealing with a union opposed to racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter will need all his political skills to succeed. He's been given a terribly tough job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's all about fire, the political kind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Neutral, or not enough information": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 6s "}}

Others may see this moment as an isolated event rather than the result of the hard work of Black female candidates, political strategists and voters who have participated in the building of the Democratic Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both would be a mistake.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Harris is the embodiment of the growing political power of Black women to make demands within the Democratic Party \u2014 and the political sophistication to ensure that those demands are met.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many recent elections, Black women voters have turned out at higher rates than any other demographic. More than 90 percent of Black women have cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections. In 2008 and 2012 they had the highest turnout rate among all racial, ethnic and gender groups. No other major demographic is as loyal to either party as Black people. And Black women have become increasingly organized and focused on making that support meaningful for themselves and their community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That kind of turnout and loyalty doesn\u2019t just happen. Largely without any major investment from the Democratic Party, Black women have worked through grass-roots organizations to register new voters and motivate them to cast ballots. The work of groups like the New Georgia Project to transform the electoral landscape of the South has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new voters. In Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017. Across the country, Black congresswomen like Lucy McBath of Georgia, Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts have run for office and won historic victories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black women have also formed organizations to support and encourage more Black women to run for office and maximize their political power. Glynda Carr\u2019s Higher Heights for America, Aimee Allison\u2019s She The People and Leah Daughtry\u2019s Power Rising are examples of organizations that convene discussions with African-American women, empower those who want to run for office and insist that candidates answer questions that are important to Black women. During the Democratic primaries, nearly every candidate showed up to discuss his or her views about race and gender at a forum held by She The People in April. They understood that their road to the White House is paved not just by Black women\u2019s votes but also by their labor as volunteers, community influencers and, increasingly, important donors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, this moment is decades in the making. A century ago this month, women demanded and earned the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment. In that effort, African-American women were often asked to march behind white women and participate in segregated rallies. Most Black women didn\u2019t get access to the ballot until the Voting Rights Act was passed 45 years later. African-American women understood the power of the vote to choose candidates who would enact policies that either helped or hindered their quest for equal rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation\u2019s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups. They are keenly aware that all forms of oppression disproportionately affect Black women; consequently, Black women\u2019s movements have always been inclusive even when that inclusion was not reciprocated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So the selection of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential running mate is bigger than an individual choice. It is not just about this one Black woman and her success. The selection is a win for Black women politicians who have higher political ambitions, Black women operatives who want to have more say in how campaigns are run, and Black women voters who want to see themselves among the many candidates the party fields every election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kamala Harris stands on the shoulders of giants in the Democratic Party who broke down barriers \u2014 the congresswomen Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and political operatives like Donna Brazile and Minyon Moore. Millions of Black women and their political labor have made this historic day possible. Ms. Harris\u2019s selection represents a major step forward in Black women\u2019s political ascendance and not a single victory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

They're showing that this mayor--this son of the Old Guard--is trying hard to right old wrongs and create opportunities for blacks and Hispanics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, his commitment to integrating the police and fire commands may be more a product of political peacekeeping than a craving for justice, but compared to the union bosses, Daley is performing like a latter-day Lincoln.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the vicious and misleading radio commercials being run by the Fraternal Order of Police to whip up resentment against Daley's use of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in police promotions. The spot begins with a mock \"auction\" of sergeant's stripes to the highest bidder. An authoritative voice warns ominously that the bad old days of political clout have returned to the police promotion process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this because the city, in an effort to get more black and Hispanic sergeants and lieutenants, is going to base 30 percent of the next promotional draft on job performance, not just test scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the moaning and wailing of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, which in 32 months of contract negotiations resisted a similar method to get more black and Hispanic lieutenants, captains and battalion chiefs. Finally, union leaders agreed grudgingly to basing 10 percent of promotions on performance rather than test scores, but only when the city agreed to pay the salaries of the top three union officers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's a union, 31 percent of whose members are black or Hispanic, holding out against Daley's efforts to promote an equitable number of blacks and Hispanics. Here's a union in which not a single minority has been elected to the governing board from its 13 city districts. Here's a union that gives full voting rights to retired members, who are predominantly white, and barely gives the time of day to nearly a third of its active membership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So it falls to the Daley administration to produce a police and fire service that reflects, if not mirrors, the racial and ethnic makeup of the entire city. And progress must be eked out in spite of the unions, not because of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for black and Hispanic police and firefighters who complain the city is moving too slowly, it is they who need to gear up and get organized. It takes hard work to exert power within a union, just as it takes hard work to get ready for an exam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Minority shots at Daley, like those from the unions, only reinforce the perception that the mayor has got this one about right.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is the main subject.": "1"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat against": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 39s "}}

These essays, accumulated from 1946 to 1961, offer a vivid, stimulating challenge to that \"age of conformity.\" If variety is a charm of essay collections, their bane can be a random unevenness -- here overcome by a furiously cool, contrarian intelligence, which unifies this assortment of pieces about politics, literature, sex, theater and fashion. Questioning with aphoristic zingers the Kinsey Reports' mechanistic approach to the female orgasm, the journalistic pieties of John Hersey's \"Hiroshima,\" the upwardly mobile aspirations of women's fashion magazines, the genius of Tennessee Williams, the anti-American tourist reports of Simone de Beauvoir, the outrages of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Mary McCarthy spares neither the right nor the left -- nor herself. In \"My Confession,\" she describes how, starting out from the wrong motives -- ignorance, shallowness, vanity, social snobbery -- she arrived at a coherent liberal anticommunist position. \"I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late for me to become a Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned young men I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to take up young, like ballet dancing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Essays of Leonard Michaels</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. A master of the short story, whose tales conveyed high anxiety, urban violence and exuberant intellectual analysis, Leonard Michaels was also an extraordinarily fine essayist. This collection, assembled posthumously by his widow, is divided between critical and autobiographical essays, though everything Michaels wrote was deeply personal. Whether seeing as a boy the movie \"Gilda,\" where the heroine marries a sadist played by George Macready (\"I didn't want Macready to unzipper Rita Hayworth's dress\"), or his father offering him some money before his date (\"He gave. I took.\"), Michaels gets to feelings of vulnerability and shame with astonishing speed. Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by Jewish immigrant parents, speaking only Yiddish until he was 5, he perfected a terse English sentence that carries traces of Yiddish's ironic, singsong, questioning shrug. \"Paradox as a cognitive mode is everywhere in Yiddish. It's probably in the genes and may explain the Jewish love of jokes.\" His humor is both hilarious and dark, issuing from an evolved persona that had elements of the street-savvy hipster, academic and Talmudist. Above all, he was a storyteller -- proof positive that good essays are at bottom stories about the mind at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speak, Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Vladimir Nabokov (1951)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. A series of linked autobiographical essays by one of the masters of modern prose, this marvel of a memoir begins with the rather dire sentiment: \"The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our true existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.\" That crack of light becomes suffused with sunshine, as Vladimir Nabokov recollects his enchanted boyhood, the pampered son of aristocratic parents, surrounded by 50 servants in their St. Petersburg townhouse and country estate. In dreamy, nostalgic, prismatic sentences colored with sensuous detail, the author conjures up a way of life soon to become extinct, erased by the Bolsheviks' takeover. Nabokov takes the narrative further into his darker years of exile, loss, poverty and literary apprenticeship, meanwhile conversing with his tender ghosts. There is a loving portrait of his liberal, witty jurist father, who passed on to Vladimir a butterfly-hunting obsession, as well as his mother, relatives and tutors. But the gem of the collection is a portrait of his portly Swiss-French governess, Mademoiselle, who specialized in feeling proud and miserable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hunger of Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Richard Rodriguez (1982)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Subtitled \"The Education of Richard Rodriguez,\" this brilliant debut announced an author who would go on to write captivating essays for decades to come. Ignoring an editor's advice that he write \"in stories -- not a series of essays. Let's have more Grandma,\" Mr. Rodriguez chose the essay form because it allowed him to pursue a political argument via his personal experience. At the time, his opposition to bilingual education and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> raised hackles, yet so effectively was he able to portray the distance between the intimate Spanish of his home and the public English of his schooling that his position made perfect sense, at least to himself. \"I remember what was so grievously lost to define what was necessarily gained.\" The son of working-class parents who spoke broken English, he excelled at schoolwork and became a \"scholarship boy\" whose immersion in a cultivated, moneyed world drew him unavoidably if guiltily away from his loving family. Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates, with alarming frankness and elegant prose, a singular perspective, deeply moral, fusing sardonic detachment and affective longing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Sign of Saturn</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Susan Sontag (1980)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. After her first two essay books, \"Against Interpretation\" and \"Styles of Radical Will,\" established Susan Sontag as our exigent queen of cultural criticism, she allowed herself to relax some of that cerebral severity, bringing a more generous warmth to her third collection. She began \"Under the Sign of Saturn\" with a touching tribute to a writer she greatly admired: \"The grief I feel at Paul Goodman's death is sharper because we were not friends, though we co-inhabited several of the same worlds. . . . I disliked him -- the reason being, as I often explained plaintively during his lifetime, that I felt he didn't like me.\" This honest piece was followed by the magnificent title essay, a deeply insightful portrait of Walter Benjamin, the brainy, depressive writer with whom Sontag felt a kinship, as well as superb appreciations of Antonin Artaud, Elias Canetti and Sontag's friend and mentor, Roland Barthes. The collection also features Sontag's celebrated takedown of Leni Riefenstahl, \"Fascinating Fascism,\" but for the most part Sontag gives herself over here to her love of various heroes of the life of the mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Phillip Lopate</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"affirmative_action_relevance": {"Affirmative action is mentioned, but is not the main subject": "2"}, "affirmative_action_stance": {"Somewhat in favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}

It's probably the person the President accused of creating the impression of heartless foolishness by defining ketchup as a school-lunch vegetable. Instead of firing the culprit, they must have transferred him/her to Personnel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How else explain the move to select Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation? That is the already battered Federal program of aid for people who need lawyers but can't afford them. And how else explain the nomination of William Bell, a Detroit pol with no accomplishments in management or civil rights, to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission? This not the first time this Administration has looked to foxes to guard chickens, but the effort is becoming suspiciously obvious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Reagan team, to be sure, tried at first to kill the legal services program directly. But Congress, which is still supposed to write the laws, refused. The level of funding and terms of operation were then compromised, but the White House will not quit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although there is an ample supply of candidates with legal aid experience, Mr. Zumbrun has never been near that bar. He has denounced the law that he would now administer. He has vigorously opposed the program both as a California official and as president of the Pacific Legal Foundation. His preference in legal aid is helping those needy corporations that oppose Government regulation, clean water standards and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Zumbrun would devour his agency, Mr. Bell would probably just strangle his. He is black and has no known hostility to the idea of promoting equal employment. But the minority recruiting firm he leads hasn't placed a single employee this year. The Detroit company, Bold Concepts, Inc., has no phone listing. Its leader is little known in his own city and unknown to the civil rights community. His only recognized asset is political labor for Mr. Reagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The nomination of Mr. Zumbrun would insult the poor and the legal profession. The nomination of Mr. Bell is an insult to workers of any race or sex and also to managements that find themselves in job bias disputes.
