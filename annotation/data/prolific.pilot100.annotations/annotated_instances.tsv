Legal analysts said she succeeded in maintaining the profile of a moderate who would bring an open mind to the weighty legal issues likely to come to the high court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Erwin Chemerinsky</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Constitutional law scholar and dean of UC Irvine School of Law</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In the end, I think the confirmation process served two purposes: It gave the senators a chance to speak to their base, and it gave the American people the opportunity to listen to Sonia Sotomayor. But it gave no one any real sense of what she is going to be like as a justice on the Supreme Court. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She did a wonderful job of following a script that gives such a misleading and inaccurate impression of what Supreme Court justices really do. She said many times that judges apply the law, they don't make the law. Every first-year law student learns that judges make the law. Everything the Supreme Court does makes law, by definition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""There were places where she was willing to go further in a conservative direction than I would have expected her to do. We heard her firmly rejecting the use of foreign constitutional law in American decision-making. She described the Constitution as static, not evolving. I think she went further to try to appease the conservatives . . . but I think she succeeded in ensuring that her confirmation will go through smoothly.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ilya Shapiro</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cato Institute senior fellow and editor of its Supreme Court Review</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She filibustered well. . . .

It seems like she was running out the clock. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""She had a pattern of saying things that were good and should assuage people, but it was the exact opposite of what she said in previous speeches. She declined to either approve of or criticize the citing of foreign law in some death penalty cases. There was some frustration on the side of the senators that she wasn't answering.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I am less favorable toward her than I was when the hearing started because of the manner in which she responded . . . to pretend to answer the question.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kimberly West-Faulcon</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It was an interesting discussion on identity politics when they were asking her if she was a participant in such. It was the Republican senators playing identity politics themselves, appealing to the fears of white Americans about the prospects for nonwhites attaining positions of authority. They ignored her explanations of the procedural posture of decision-making in the Ricci case [white Connecticut firefighters claiming discrimination], despite the overwhelming views of commentators that the Supreme Court did make new law in deciding that case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Today was much more about creating the opportunity to drive in that particular wedge issue of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than about vetting Sonia Sotomayor. . . . A lot of what today was about was the Republican senators, who monopolized the hearing today, putting forth their own ideology and legal philosophy. . . .</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""As to how she came out in the confirmation hearing, I think she looked fabulous and accomplished the goal of appearing judicious. She left an overall impression of a moderate judge who is restrained.

How did President Bush propose to save Social Security?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) Raise the retirement age to 90.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) Impose an excise tax on cruise-ship fares and early-bird-special meals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>c) Encourage the exportation of Medicare recipients to Canada.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>d) Allow young workers to invest contributions in private savings accounts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e) Deny flu shots to senior citizens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. A Kerry commercial titled ''January Surprise'' warns that ''Bush has a plan to cut Social Security benefits by 30 to 45 percent.'' The campaign bases this on one of several options proposed by a bipartisan commission, but not endorsed by Mr. Bush, to peg future benefit increases to consumer prices instead of wages.

In a survey of 980 people stopped on the street in 10 cities, the Pere Partnership advertising agency asked respondents how their votes were swayed by the political activism of Charlton Heston, Michael Moore and Bruce Springsteen. What was the most common response?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>a) It swayed me to vote for the celebrity's candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>b) It swayed me to vote for the other candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>9.

5dafe439670a30001634eaa0	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398788879.xml.txt	"<div><p>Stranger Than Fiction</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LONDON -- New York literary agents, take note of this plot for a thriller:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A heavily armed band of Latinos -- call them the Hispanic Republican Army -- is determined to return the oppressed American ""colony"" of Texas to Mexico. Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught ""collaborating"" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a ""peace process."" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.) Charitably, the HRA offers to refrains from blowing up bars or assassinating presidents. At last they hammer out a deal, to international celebration. No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because ""peace"" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an ""oversight commissioner"" from France. Americans can no longer be trusted to run their own police.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most painfully, HRA leaders are ushered into Texas state government, and a self-confessed HRA commander is awarded the post of commissioner of education. The Texas governor says he can tolerate working with murderers on only one condition: The HRA must destroy at least some of its 100-ton illegal arsenal, which it has kept for a rainy day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, does Mr. Bartlet get tough? No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The ""Real"" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake. It has sold -- foreign rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>British Prime Minister Tony Blair uses the fact that mainland Britons (and Americans) are bored and confused by Northern Ireland. Awkward formulations like ""putting arms beyond use"" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA ""offer"" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine. Ulster sets a disturbing precedent. To avoid abridging the most fundamental democratic principles, we may be forced to turn elsewhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Shriver is a London-based American novelist and journalist who lived for 12 years in Belfast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: The `Void' in the British System"" -- WSJ Sept. 5, 2001)</p></div>"			2	2

Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is ""no,"" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the ""religious right""--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>"			2					5

But listen to us. One side pretends to believe that racial discrimination, no matter how rampant and flagrant it used to be, is now ended. Oh, maybe there's a bigot or two in the woodpile, but discrimination as a matter for governmental concern is a thing of the past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side pretends to believe that only racists who oppose minority progress could be against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Discrimination a thing of the past indeed! A black man in America still hasn't got a chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each side knows (but feels no urge to acknowledge) that there is at least some justice to the other's position. The blatant segregation and discrimination are largely over. Law now forbids such racism, and -- I really do believe -- public opinion won't countenance it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But racial fairness (in some instances, in some arenas) still eludes us. Corporate management and directorships, legal and accountancy partnerships, and even concern for the plight of our children clearly are not distributed on the sole basis of deservedness. Race matters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is complicated and inconsistent and hard to figure out. Instead of undertaking the effort to figure it out, we draw the lines as starkly as we can and force the public to choose one incomplete reality (ours, we hope) and reject the other side's partial truth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It happens not just in our race relations but throughout our politics. It even happens in our courts, as when the clever Barry Scheck deliberately cut out any middle-gray consideration in the trial of Louise Woodward, the British au pair. Force the jury to choose between the cold-blooded murder of an innocent child and innocence (or at least reasonable doubt), he thought, and surely there won't be a conviction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His now-famous miscalculation (he was in court this week trying to reinstate the grays) might serve as a lesson to us all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it might show us the wisdom of changing the terms of the debate. Much of what I'm saying, I admit, is based on my belief that most Americans want to be fair and want our important institutions to reflect that fairness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't believe there are significant, politically influential segments of the society that are happy over the fact that African American admissions at Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, are down 80 percent as a direct result of Proposition 209's ban on racial preference, or that the first-year class has but a single black member. I don't believe there are large pockets of secret jubilation that a similar trend is in evidence at the University of Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, though, I doubt that many <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> supporters -- including the beleaguered Bill Lee -- want to parcel out society's goodies on the basis of racial entitlement. Many of us may defend, but few of us are thrilled by, voting districts drawn purely on the basis of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We want (is this hopelessly naive?) the same thing: a society in which gifts and grit and character matter more than pigmentation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what are we fighting about? Mainly, I think, about how to produce such a society. Some of us believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind future is to practice colorblindness now. And some of us believe that colorblindness after centuries of racism will merely lock in white advantage -- that we need to level the playing field before insisting on a single set of rules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I remember when black quarterbacks were a rarity in the National Football League -- when the most talented collegiate passers were, if they were black, switched to defensive back or running back or some such. Then a couple of coaches broke the mold -- <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>? -- and then a couple more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do the six starting quarterbacks (out of 30 NFL teams) constitute parity? Wrong question. What is true is that there is, at last, reason for young black athletes to believe they can go as far, at any position, as their talent takes them. As Gene Washington, a black front office executive with the league, told a reporter:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""What's most interesting to me is that I don't notice it. That's a good sign.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a very good sign.</p></div>"		1		2

Nonetheless, liberals shouldn't pretend that academia is untouched by political prejudices. Conservatives do face some bias and are wildly underrepresented in the social sciences; enough, perhaps, to warrant new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a recent study, only 6.6% of professors in the social sciences self-identify as Republicans (compared with 24.2% in business, 23.3% in engineering, and 22.9% in the health sciences). In sociology, Marxists outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1. Conservative professors are, then, less well represented in the social sciences than women and people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imbalance is partly attributable to the fact that conservative students steer clear of the social sciences well before they consider graduate programs. One study found that students' politics is among the very best predictors of their undergraduate major choice, with conservatives tending to select the natural sciences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's possible that these conservative undergraduates simply prefer the natural sciences -- some evidence, for example, suggests that they are slightly more focused on financial success than are liberals. But it's also germane that conservatives feel uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A climate survey conducted by the University of Colorado found that Republican students were more than three times as likely as their Democratic peers to feel intimidated when sharing their political ideas in class. Another study found that students active in campus conservative groups avoid coursework in the social sciences -- an especially striking discovery given these students' self-evidently strong interest in social and political issues. A third study found that conservatives report less satisfaction with their coursework in the social sciences than do liberal students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've also found that right-leaning PhD students seem to avoid the most politicized subfields in the social sciences. One young political scientist, for example, told us that she would have preferred to study the Middle East, but opted for a safer subfield instead: ""I didn't do the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which was the thing I wanted to do."" As one professor of the ancient world -- a safe subfield in history -- explained more generally: ""If you're a conservative, there [are] such huge no-go zones.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one exception -- that proves the rule -- is economics. Economics has a long history of openness to thinkers on both sides of the political divide and is the one social science field that actually looks like America; it has roughly equal proportions of professors who identify as Republicans, independents and Democrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Academic sorting is especially troubling given that the university is one of the only institutions that could model civil discourse for young people in our polarized age, an example that is hard to provide with so few conservatives about. Additionally, a growing number of social scientists are recognizing that political homogeneity makes it hard for humanistic disciplines to converge on the best approximation of the truth; homogenous fields not only generate a narrower range of research interests and interpretations, they are also plagued by confirmation bias -- our tendency to accept findings and theories that fit our assumptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One liberal argument for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is sympathetic to these very points. In his 1978 opinion on Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. noted that truth is discovered ""out of a multitude of tongues."" (He was quoting an earlier decision on another topic.) If Justice Powell is right -- if the primary purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to increase the variety of tongues -- then we should increase conservative ones too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some might reasonably object that the real purpose of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to remedy historical discrimination. Universities, however, have long emphasized the virtues of diversity over remedial justice. In fact, liberals embraced the diversity rationale in the 1970s partly because it allowed them to extend <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> to new groups -- especially women -- with far weaker historical grievances than African Americans. Today, universities are so committed to diversity -- not remedial justice -- that they are now practicing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for men so that their campuses don't become even more dominated by female students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity is now the new religion of the university -- and it's one they could practice much better. We don't endorse preferences in graduate admissions and hiring. At a bare minimum, however, universities should stop barring conservative speakers from their campuses. In just the past year, for example, Williams College disinvited two conservative speakers from its ""uncomfortable learning"" series.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hiring committees, liberal faculty might also question their natural preference for like-minded colleagues. (Progressive professors often say that they prefer to hire liberals, all else being equal.) Before they start sorting through resumes, departments might consider advertising positions in fields that are more popular among conservatives, such as military history, political history, the American founding, sociology of religion and natural law. Scholars in such fields would bring some balance to a curriculum increasingly dominated by race and gender. Finally, universities could grant visiting appointments in conservative thought, an experiment already underway at the University of Colorado.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even these modest reforms should help conservative feel much more welcome in all of academia, not just in some of its quarters. When that happens, the university will also deepen its public legitimacy -- an increasingly rare and fragile good in our polarized age. But that fine achievement depends critically on liberals. As conservative professors, we have defended the progressive university against its polemical right-wing critics. Now we are asking the university to better practice what it preaches.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jon A.

5dafe439670a30001634eaa0	aa_opeds_sample/txt/423943644.xml.txt	"<div><p>BEHIND THE MIAMI RIOT; by David Whitman</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination. This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>"			2			1		
5dafe439670a30001634eaa0	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt	"<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word ""integrity."" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the ""integrity"" or ""legitimacy"" or ""reputation"" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was ""trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington."" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for ""a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts ""been just an associate justice, and not the chief"" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a ""strike"" was changed to a ""ball"" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: ""Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: ""By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning ""sufficient political capital"" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"			2		3			
5dafe439670a30001634eaa0	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1011079659.xml.txt	"<div><p>Conservative cliches</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many of us who pontificate for a living, my column-writing colleague Jonah Goldberg apparently toils away in daily frustration that so many people fail to take his political advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would explain his new book, which takes on one of the world's least threatening problems, the political cliches that many people utter as a substitute for original thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is titled ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas."" With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like ""violence never settles anything"" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word ""never."" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer."" Goldberg responds, ""So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?"" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like ""Diversity is strength,"" either. (""Cool,"" he writes. ""The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!"") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Sure, he writes, ""if the other man is an idiot."" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""We don't solve problems by throwing money at them."" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare."" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left."" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""America: Love It Or Leave It."" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?"" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, ""Reality has a liberal bias.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet.

Al ""The Mushroom"" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,"" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no ""visuals.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go ""vrrooom"" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I'm not with the city anymore,"" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means ""mushroom"" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a ""City Official A.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any opinions on it,"" Grzyb said. ""I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I don't really have any comment,"" Grzyb said. ""That's it. Thank you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,"" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I know nothing about it, I tell you,"" Daley insisted. ""I know nothing about it, any other questions?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes. And a very large miracle brought the Duffs $100 million of your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"	3				3			
63daabbd0ca8de9fc5709d1d	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2700218837.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Strength of Our Political Loyalties Changes Our Actual Beliefs</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When so many voters — a majority, in fact — say that they prefer consensus to conflict, why does polarization continue to intensify?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a paper that came out in June, “Explanations for Inequality and Partisan Polarization in the U.S., 1980 — 2020,” Elizabeth Suhay and Mark Tenenbaum, political scientists at American University, and Austin Bartola, of Quadrant Strategies, provide insight into why so much discord permeates American politics:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scholars who research polarization have almost exclusively focused on the relationship between Americans’ policy opinions and their partisanship. In this article, we discuss a different type of partisan polarization underappreciated by scholars: “belief polarization,” or disagreements over what people perceive to be true.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of belief polarization has been defined in a number of ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their May 2021 paper, “Belief polarization in a complex world,” Alan Jern, Kai-min Kevin Chang and Charles Kemp — of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Melbourne — write: “Belief polarization occurs when two people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, they continue, “ample evidence that people sustain different beliefs even when faced with the same information, and they interpret that information differently.” They also note that “stark differences in beliefs can arise and endure due to human limitations in interpreting complex information.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kristoffer Nimark, an economist at Cornell, and Savitar Sundaresan, of Imperial College London, describe belief polarization this way: “The beliefs of ex ante identical agents over time can cluster in two distinct groups at opposite ends of the belief space.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scott F. Aikin and Robert B. Talisse, professors of philosophy at Vanderbilt, argue in their 2019 paper — “How Does Belief Polarization Work” — that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of what makes belief polarization so disconcerting is its ubiquity. It has been extensively studied for more than 50 years and found to be operative within groups of all kinds, formal and informal. Furthermore, belief polarization does not discriminate between different kinds of belief. Like-minded groups polarize regardless of whether they are discussing banal matters of fact, matters of personal taste, or questions about value. What’s more, the phenomenon operates regardless of the explicit point of the group’s discussion. Like-minded groups polarize when they are trying to decide an action that the group will take; and they polarize also when there is no specific decision to be reached. Finally, the phenomenon is prevalent regardless of group members’ nationality, race, gender, religion, economic status, and level of education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Talisse, writing separately, observes that:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The social environment itself can trigger extremity shifts. These prompts need not be verbal, explicit, or literal; they can be merely implicit signals to group members that some belief is prevalent among them — hats, pins, campaign signs, logos, and gestures are all potential initiators of belief polarization. Further, as corroboration is really a matter of numbers, those with the power to present the appearance of widespread acceptance among a particular social group of some idea thereby have the power to induce extremity shifts among those who identify with that group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most salient recent illustration of belief polarization is the diametrically opposed view of Trump loyalists and of their Democratic adversaries over the legitimacy of the 2020 election: Trump supporters are convinced it was stolen; Democrats and independents are certain that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, politicians on the right — and Fox News — are treating the F.B.I. raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago on Monday as a corrupt politicization of federal investigative authority while liberals — and CNN — counter that the raid demonstrates that no one, no matter how powerful, is above the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay and her colleagues expand the scope of belief polarization to look at the differences between Republicans and Democrats over the causes of inequality:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We illustrate large, and increasing, partisan divides in beliefs regarding whether an unequal society, or unequal behavior, is the cause of socioeconomic inequality. Republican politicians and citizens are optimistic about the American dream and pessimistic about poor people’s behavior; Democratic politicians and citizens are pessimistic about the Dream and optimistic about poor people’s ability to succeed if given the chance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These patterns, Suhay and her collaborators continue,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>hold for beliefs about economic inequality along both class and race lines. Variation in societal versus individual blame is consistently associated with views on social welfare, taxation, and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. We conclude that Americans’ beliefs about the fairness of the economy represent a crucial component of a redistributive versus anti-redistributive ideology that is increasingly associated with the two political parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay writes that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic Party has long justified its left-leaning economic policies with two central claims: significant economic inequality exists between individuals and social groups, and these great inequalities are unfair because society, not individuals, are to blame for them. The latter proposition is especially important. It is difficult to deny that many harsh inequalities exist in the United States. Exorbitant wealth as well as homelessness are plain to see. However, such inequalities might be tolerated if they are viewed as the outcome of a meritocratic system. Democrats argue instead that “the American dream” — success via hard work — is not a reality for many. Thus, low-income people deserve government assistance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conversely, Suhay continues, Republicans emphasize</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>aggregate economic growth and downplay the extent of inequality. Second, Republicans argue that existing inequalities are fair — successful people have achieved success via hard work or ingenuity, and those facing difficult economic circumstances are to blame for them. Third, in response to Democrats’ instinct to use government to combat inequality, Republicans argue government efforts to intervene in business affairs, redistribute wealth, and assist those in need often do more harm than good, depressing the economic output of both firms and individuals. These narratives justify Republicans’ conservative economic agenda by insisting that the status quo is fine: inequality is minimal; inequalities that do exist are “just deserts”; and, even if one wished to help, government intervention in fact undermines individual and aggregate prosperity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suhay, Tenenbaum and Bartola cite data from American National Election Studies and the Pew Research Center to track the increasing polarization between Republicans and Democrats on various questions, which require respondents to agree or disagree with statements like these: “one of the big problems in this country is that we don’t give everyone an equal chance”; “most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard”; and “poor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1997, 68 percent of Republican and 43 percent of Democratic survey respondents chose “have it easy,” a 25-point difference. By 2017, 73 percent of Republicans said the poor “have it easy,” while 19 percent of Democrats shared that view, 54-points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Suhay noted that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>many social scientists today are focused on misinformed and extreme beliefs in the Republican Party, including Republicans’ greater likelihood of rejecting climate science and COVID-19 vaccination and their embrace of Trump’s ‘big lie’ about the 2020 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, Suhay wrote by email, many of those same scholars “are missing growing extremity on the political left. It may be more benign or even beneficial in some cases, but it is still a phenomenon worth study.” In addition to “a surge of claims on the left that the economy is extremely unequal and that this is because our country does not provide equal opportunity to all of its inhabitants,” there has been a parallel surge among liberals on the issue of “racial justice — in both the economic and criminal justice arena.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A third development on the left, Suhay added, and one</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>where we have seen the most rapid change, is around gender identity. Democrats increasingly say society ought to protect the rights of transgender people and the expression of transgender identity because gender fluidity is a natural part of the human condition and trying to curb its expression causes people harm. The popularity of each of these views has surged on the left recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is further evidence that even people who are knowledgeable about complex issues are sharply polarized along partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Lee at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Brendan Nyhan at Dartmouth, Jason Reifler at the University of Exeter and D.J. Flynn at IE University in Madrid, argue in their paper “More Accurate, but No Less Polarized: Comparing the Factual Beliefs of Government Officials and the Public” that while “political elites are consistently more accurately informed than the public,” the “increase in accuracy does not translate into reduced factual belief polarization. These findings demonstrate that a more informed political elite does not necessarily mitigate partisan factual disagreement in policymaking.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lee, Nyhan, Reifler and Flynn assessed the views of elites through a survey in 2017 of 743 “elected policymakers, legislative staffers, and top administrative positions in local and state government in the United States.” Three quarters of the sample held elective office. The survey tested belief accuracy by partisanship and elite status on eight issues including health care, the share of taxes paid by the top 1 percent, climate change and voter fraud.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their conclusions run counter to assumptions that elites are less polarized than the general public because “they tend to be more knowledgeable, which is associated with greater belief accuracy” and because they “possess domain expertise in politics and public policy that could reduce the influence of cognitive biases.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, Lee and colleagues counter, “belief polarization can be unchanged or widen when belief accuracy increases.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked Nyhan about the consequences of the findings and he wrote back by email:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important contribution of our study is to challenge the assumption that we will disagree less about the facts if we know more. Elites are better informed than the public on average but Democrats and Republicans still are still deeply divided in their beliefs about those facts. In some ways, the conclusion of our study is optimistic — government officials are better informed than the public. That’s what most of us would hope to be true. But the findings do suggest we should avoid thinking that people becoming more informed will make the factual divides in our society go away. Belief polarization is a reality that is not easily overcome.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One theme that emerges repeatedly in looking at belief polarization is the role race plays as a central factor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter K. Enns and Ashley Jardina, political scientists at Cornell and Duke, make the case in their October 2021 paper, “Complicating the role of White racial attitudes and anti-immigrant sentiment in the 2016 U.S. presidential election” that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the research on the relationship between white racial attitudes and Trump support is part of a tradition that assumes that racial attitudes are fairly stable predispositions that form early in life and then later become important for political reasoning. Implied in this line of research is that politicians or political campaigns do not change levels of prejudice, but they can prime these attitudes, or make them more or less salient and therefore more or less politically relevant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enns and Jardina write that, in contrast to this view, over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign “many whites shifted their survey responses on questions related to race and immigration to align with their support for Trump or Clinton.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To test their argument, the authors used “a unique panel data set from surveys conducted by YouGov of more than 5,000 respondents interviewed at multiple points during the 2016 presidential election campaign.” From that study, they found that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong link between white attitudes toward Black Americans and Trump support observed in prior studies is likely due as much to white Trump supporters updating their survey responses to report opinions more consistent with Trump’s, as it is to Trump drawing support from more racially antagonistic white voters. Similar results emerge with respect to whites’ immigration opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They found, for example, that from January 2016 to August 2016, the percentage of Trump supporters voicing strong opposition to Black Lives Matter grew by roughly 15 percentage points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Enns contended that</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>regardless of the precise underlying mechanisms (and multiple mechanisms could be at work), the evidence suggests that Trump’s rhetoric had a meaningful effect on the views his supporters expressed about these issues. We are definitely arguing that the attitudes individuals express can be changed by what candidates they support say and do. Although we cannot observe actual beliefs, to the extent that expressing previously unexpressed beliefs has a reinforcing effect, that would also provide evidence of a deepening or potential changing of racial attitudes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The strong association between Trump support and whites’ views on racial issues, Enns and Jardina argue in their paper,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>was not merely a result of Trump attracting racist whites by way of his own racist rhetoric or a reflection of partisan racial sorting that had already occurred; it was also a result of white Trump supporters changing their views to be more in line with Trump’s over the course of his presidential campaign. In other words, Trump not only attracted whites with more conservative views on race; he also made his white supporters more likely to espouse increasingly extreme views on issues related to immigration and on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement and police killings of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Andrew M. Engelhardt, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina—Greensboro, developed a similar line of analysis in his January 2020 paper, “Racial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an email, Engelhardt wrote:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the reason White Democrats and White Republicans hold increasingly different views about Black Americans is due to their partisanship. It’s not just that Democrats with negative views became Republicans, or Republicans with more positive views became Democrats. Rather, people are changing their attitudes, and part of this, I argue, is due to how politicians talk about Black Americans. Republicans, for instance, could have internalized Trump’s negative rhetoric, and increasingly held more negative views. Democrats, similarly, hear Trump say these negative things and they move opposite, holding more positive views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his paper, Engelhardt wrote that undergirding past studies of the role of race in politics and policymaking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>is an assumption that racial animus feeds political conflict. I turn this conventional wisdom on its head by arguing that political conflict can shape racial attitudes — people’s views and beliefs about groups understood to be racial. Political scientists have failed to examine this possibility, perhaps because racial attitudes are seen as persistent and influential predispositions that form during childhood, long before most Americans become political animals. According to this line of reasoning, individuals use these early formed attitudes to make sense of politics; racial attitudes lead to partisanship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ever-growing divide between left and right extends well beyond racial issues and attitudes. In his email, Engelhardt wrote that his results are “suggestive of partisanship motivating changes in other orientations which we might presumably see as more stable and core to individuals.” He cited research showing that “partisanship influences religiosity and religious affiliation” and other studies linking “political concerns to changes in racial self-identification.” Engelhardt added that he has “some unpublished results where I find partisanship leads Democrats to hold more positive views of gay men and lesbians, transgender individuals, and feminists, over time, with Republicans holding more negative views of these groups in the same period (data range 2016-2020).”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their January 2022 paper, “The Origins and Consequences of Racialized Schemas about U.S. Parties,” Kirill Zhirkov and Nicholas Valentino, political scientists at the Universities of Virginia and Michigan, make an interesting argument, that, in effect, “Two parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zhirkov and Valentino continue:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in the 1970s, Democratic candidates in presidential elections started to attract large/ shares of nonwhite voters whereas Republicans increasingly relied on votes of racially conservative whites. Over the same period, voters’ positions on seemingly nonracial political issues have gradually become more intertwined with racial resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the two scholars write,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the growing racial gap between the Democratic and Republican support bases leads to formation of racialized stereotypes about the two parties. Specifically, a non-trivial share of American electorate currently views the Democratic Party as nonwhite and the Republican Party as white, though in reality whites continue to be a majority of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This “imagined racial coalition of each party,” in the view of Zhirkov and Valentino,</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>carries profound implications for the ongoing discussion in the discipline about affective polarization in American politics: whites feel colder toward the Democratic Party when they imagine its coalition to be more heavily made up on nonwhites and feel warmer toward the Republican Party when they perceive it to be dominated by their racial group. As a consequence, rather than a cause, they may then come to accept a more conservative issue package advocated by the modern Republican Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Racial attitudes, the authors argue persuasively, “are now important predictors of opinions about electoral fairness, gun control, policing, international trade and health care.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are, Zhirkov and Valentino note, long-range implications for the future of democracy here:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon as ethnic parties start to compete for political power, winning — rather than implementing a certain policy — becomes the goal in and of itself due to associated boost in group status and self-esteem of its members. Moreover, comparative evidence suggests that U.S. plurality-based electoral system contributes to politicization of ethnic cleavages rather than mitigates them. Therefore, the racialization of American parties is likely to continue, and the intensity of political conflict in the United States is likely to grow.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I asked the authors how they would characterize the importance of race in contemporary American politics. In a jointly written email, they replied that in research to be published in the future, “we show that race is at least as strong, and often stronger, than cleavages such as religion, ideology, and class.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pessimistic outlook for the prospect of a return to less divisive politics revealed in many of the papers cited here, and the key role of racial conflict in driving polarization, suggest that the ability of the United States to come to terms with its increasingly multiracial, multiethnic population remains in question. This country has been a full-fledged democracy for less than 60 years — since passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the changes wrought by three additional revolutions: in civil rights, women’s rights and gay rights. These developments — or upheavals — and especially the reaction to them have tested the viability of our democracy and suggest, at the very least, an uphill climb ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

She meant my favorite steakhouse, and the Duffs' favorite steakhouse, Gene & Georgetti's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene's is a hangout where information is traded, among politicians, insiders, reporters, wise-guys, salesmen, consultants, from the buttoned down to the gold chains crowd. And what makes it work is that they serve the best steak in the city, period. The service is impeccable without being showy and the drinks are honest. Gene's is a part of the old Chicago, the city as it was before so much of the downtown was turned into a theme park.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also the place where the Duffs came up to me about a year ago, their tough, hard eyes smiling. They asked me why they don't ever see my children playing in the front yard of my home in the suburbs. They asked it twice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the columns didn't stop and neither did the news stories by the investigative reporters, or Tribune editorials about the mayor's friends. And here's why:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not about getting personal with the mayor or the Duffs. Though the mayor has been a frequent target in my column, what drives the criticism is the obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars that go to his pals. In deal after deal after deal, the attitude is that his guys can take what they want and the people in the neighborhoods better shut up about it, while higher taxes put more and more pressure on families to pay for the deals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not personal, it's business, and it's your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley is an able politician and has done some good things, including taking personal responsibility for trying to improve the public schools. But he must also take personal responsibility for his friends who get rich on government contracts he controls, paid for by our tax dollars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Duff stories broke in 1999, when Tribune investigative reporters Ray Gibson, Andrew Martin and Laurie Cohen wrote about the Duffs' City Hall deals and their connections to Daley and the Outfit. You can find the archive of the stories available on the Tribune's Web site.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of what was alleged in the indictments was laid out in those stories: that the Duffs, who are white, ran phony front companies that got $100 million in city contracts that should have gone to firms owned by women or minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley knew the Duffs were not minorities, even when he was a crime-fighting Cook County state's attorney. A Duff sits across from you, gives you campaign cash, pours a drink, it's reasonable to assume that even the mayor could tell whether the person was white or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think back to how the media treated the late Mayor Harold Washington, when Washington's buddies were involved in contract scandals. Back then, even minor stories about corruption got sustained media attention, particularly from TV and radio, even if the dollar amounts were only chump change. Washington faced constant media pressure on corruption issues. TV crawled all over him for years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If I was white, you wouldn't be doing this to me,"" Washington said once, in a private moment, as he filched a smoke from me and we stood in a parking lot after a campaign stop. We argued about it, and I told him that since we were off the record, he didn't have to play the race card. ""You don't know anything, do you?"" he said. He was right. I was a kid, then. I didn't know.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Duff stories first broke, involving a white mayor and white guys getting rich, the Chicago media scrutiny wasn't as intense. TV news didn't hound Daley the way it hounded Washington. The mayor must appreciate the kindness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm sure he also appreciates the new federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald. The feds have already outflanked former Gov. George Ryan's Republicans. Ryan himself is a target. And now the feds are moving toward Daley's Democratic City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Daley-Duff relationship is not just a Tribune story anymore. A group of citizens--sworn as federal grand jurors--looked at the evidence. They didn't find a flaw in the system, as the city claims. They found a crime.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A couple friends and I talked of this at Gene's, about the change in things, about the importance of an independent federal prosecutor, about how the bipartisan political clique that runs this state tried to stop Fitzgerald's appointment in hopes of installing one of their own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just then, the cell phones began chirping and word of the Duff indictments began to spread through the bar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our steaks medium rare. And they were tasty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"	3				3

We used to be roommates long ago, and she's finally marrying her partner of 10 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When she told me she was getting married, she did all the usual things that people who are about to be married do. She showed me a picture of her dress, and we talked about the kind of cake they were going to get. In the end, she and her partner decided they'd have a quick wedding in Las Vegas and then do another, more formal ceremony back east in the city where we live. That's this evening, and I'm happy for both of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I used the word ""partner"" in an attempt to be intentionally vague. But I'll tell you now that the bride is a cisgender woman. Her husband is a cisgender man. In short, it's the kind of wedding that conservatives believe is the only kind of wedding that counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's a more complex aspect to their nuptials. She is bisexual and proudly so. It just so happens that she fell in love with a man. She has had many relationships with women. Had she fallen in love with a woman, it's quite possible that the seamstress could have refused to alter her dress, the bakery could have refused to make her a cake. But she avoided all of that by marrying a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Supreme Court has been very busy lately making clear which kinds of people it truly values. By striking down Roe v. Wade, the justices showed us how much they value the opinions of women who want a say in their own health care. By striking down <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, they showed us how much they value White over Black and Brown students. By striking down student loan forgiveness, they demonstrated how much they value those who don't have enough money to avoid the Ponzi scheme called student loans. And today they essentially legalized the unequal treatment of LGBTQ people by holding that discrimination is a small price to pay if it lifts up just one kind of love.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Supreme Court has become a conservative dreamland: Out of touch with the country and determined to satisfy conservatives who think they win only when someone else loses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lorie Smith, the Colorado web designer who refuses to make websites for LGBTQ people, may experience a boom in her business. This legal action was the best thing she could have done to make that happen. I don't know if she's a particularly good web designer or not, but I do know she will be lionized in some circles because she helped make people who conservatives don't like suffer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This need by conservatives is not about faith, really. It's about ensuring that Americans they don't know and don't like will suffer. They consider it a win for White people when Black and Brown people suffer. A win for men when women suffer. A win for older, richer people when younger, poorer people suffer. Everything in their minds is binary. We win. You lose. Black and white. And our current Supreme Court has become the favored weapon in their arsenal to bring about heartache for those they don't like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it won't end here. Because whatever lines the justices may think they have carefully drawn during this term, their benefactors in the deep conservative world are just getting warmed up. Get ready for more: More behavior on your part that they will essentially outlaw. More things we're not allowed to teach. More roads for access unceremoniously cut off. More rights trampled on, and more barriers to discrimination lowered. Because the main priority of our conservative Supreme Court is to keep the status quo secure. Solid. And that means keeping certain people down.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, I will go to my friend's wedding in a few hours. And I will smile and have a good time, and I will be happy for her. There will be other LGBTQ friends of hers in attendance, and none of us would dream of sullying her day by reminding her that she's unintentionally made a choice that now, thanks to six people in Washington, places her above us in the American hierarchy of who matters most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was never put in a position to have her right to the pursuit of happiness questioned.</p></div>"			2		3			
63daabbd0ca8de9fc5709d1d	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409060590.xml.txt	"<div><p>Ashcroft The Activist</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the nominee is technically qualified for the job and is, moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole thing seems to be missing the point. I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would ""enforce the law fairly"" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws ""fairly""? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and ""crack"" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll ""enforce the law.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>) ""limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>"		1			3

And they never seem to end.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Paris protesters are getting all the attention, but France isn't the only country where angry masses are taking to the streets to be heard.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Journal reported Monday that an estimated 55,000 people gathered in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur last weekend to defend race-based policies that give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population. Defenders argue that ending racial preferences would ""dilute decades of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies introduced to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese,"" who comprise less than a quarter of the population.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> in Malaysia began in the 1950s, after the British colonial administrators, who had welcomed laborers from China, departed. Since 1971, Malays have enjoyed preferential treatment over their Chinese compatriots in everything from schooling and housing to government jobs and access to capital. The government's express goal was ""racial balance,"" and to that end Malay entrepreneurs were given preference in obtaining credit, licenses and government contracts. Developers offer Malays discounts on new homes, and shopping centers have even banned ethnic-Chinese-owned businesses to limit competition with Malay proprietors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These policies were supposed to sunset in 1991, but the country's leaders have repeatedly extended them in exchange for political support. ""Schemes favouring Malays were once deemed essential to improve the lot of Malaysia's least wealthy racial group,"" explains the Economist magazine, but ""these days they are widely thought to help mostly the well-off within that group, while failing the poor and aggravating ethnic tensions.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To anyone who has followed the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> debate in the U.S., a lot of this probably sounds familiar. Like their Malay counterparts, American proponents of racial double standards say they are necessary to help the underprivileged, even though the beneficiaries tend to be people who were already well-off to begin with. Liberal politicians defend color-conscious policies to win votes, and courts assure us the policies will not exist in perpetuity. ""We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,"" wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in a 2003 Supreme Court decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it has in Malaysia, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> continues to stoke racial and ethnic tensions in the U.S., especially in education. Harvard is being sued for discrimination against Asian applicants. The plaintiffs say Asians are held to higher standards than other applicants to limit their numbers on campus. Harvard insists that more Asians aren't admitted because they aren't as multidimensional as their non-Asian peers, an argument eerily similar to the one Ivy League schools once used to discriminate against Jews.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has angered the parents of white and Asian students by pushing for racial quotas at the city's top public high schools. Some 80% of black and Hispanic students in New York City's traditional public schools perform below grade level in reading and math. Is it really any wonder that black and Hispanic students are underrepresented at elite schools that use an admission test? Unfortunately, the mayor and his supporters would rather scrap the test than focus on doing a better job of preparing kids to take it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the debate domestically often centers on the legality of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and whether it's permitted under our constitution, a more practical concern is whether these policies actually work as intended--here in America or in other countries where they've been implemented. Malaysia's racial preferences have been in place for more than 50 years, and the Malays still haven't caught up to the ethnic Chinese, who outperform them in school and in the workforce. The gap has narrowed over the past half-century, but it remains significant, and attributing Malay progress to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is dubious. For one thing, Malays in neighboring Singapore, which has no <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and where they are a minority, are better off economically than the Malays in Malaysia, who receive favorable treatment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs in the U.S. are regularly given undeserved credit for expanding the size of the black middle class. The reality is that the most dramatic declines in black poverty preceded <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs, which began in earnest in the 1970s. Black incomes doubled in the 1960s--before <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. And blacks were entering middle-class professions at a much faster clip in the decades preceding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than they did in the decades following its implementation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the University of California system ended race-based admissions in 1996, more blacks enrolled and a higher percentage of them not only graduated but obtained degrees in the more challenging fields of engineering and science. Policies intended to help sometimes do the opposite, whether they are implemented in the U.S. or halfway around the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Jason L.

Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,"" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,"" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The court operates according to a different rule,"" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. ""There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,"" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. ""He may still be finding things out himself.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's ""median voter,"" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, ""the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.""</p></div>"			2		3

These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered ""white"" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc.

Just as we need to preserve the sanctity of elections (by prosecuting coup instigators), democracy defenders need to address judicial radicals' gross distortion of our system, resulting in the current Supreme Court's subversion of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unhinged from judicial standards, the court now roves through the policy landscape, overturning decades of law and reordering Americans' lives and institutions. It upends women's health, revamps college admissions, snatches student aid from millions and redefines public accommodations (allowing egregious discrimination). In aggrandizing power, the court illegitimately dominates policymaking, undermining democracy to an extent we have not seen in nearly 100 years. (Ronald Brownstein pointed out that similar constitutional collisions in the 1850s and 1930s took a civil war or threat of court-packing to resolve.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something must change if we want to preserve rule by the people's elected leaders responsible to voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a preliminary matter, it is essential to identify the problem. As morally and politically offensive as Supreme Court decisions on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, LGBTQ+ discrimination and student debt forgiveness might be to millions of Americans, merely criticizing the court's result is misguided and unproductive. The task is to expose the court's disintegration as a legitimate judicial body and note its emergence as a supreme right-wing policymaker. When the court operates on an ends-justify-the-means basis, shreds legal doctrine and dishonestly presents the facts, critics should not play whack-a-mole, decrying each individual rejection of widespread American values. In doing so, the court negates self-government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telltale sign that the justices have become partisan politicians: their refusal to adopt mandatory ethics rules, which destroys the essence of judicial impartiality that is the root of their legitimacy. When judges cease to eliminate conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, they appear indistinguishable from politicians wined and dined in rarefied settings by lobbyists. The stench of financial corruption, coupled with justices' intemperate rants in partisan settings and in op-eds, convinces Americans that the justices are partisan players out to score points for their own side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the court strays out of its constitutional lane when it refuses to follow consistent rules of construction and honestly address cases' facts. When, for example, the majority casts aside stare decisis (as in the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case) without admitting it or refuses to apply the test for departing from precedent (as in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), it is simply muscling its way to desired outcomes because it has the votes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse, cases are now manufactured to create policy. The majority has made complete hash out of standing and concepts such as ""case and controversy"" to reach decisions it had no business deciding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the student loan debt relief case, the court created standing out of whole cloth. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, ""The requirement that the proper party — the party actually affected — challenge an action ensures that courts do not overstep their proper bounds. … Without that requirement, courts become 'forums for the ventilation of public grievances' — for settlement of ideological and political disputes."" Here the court deliberately ignored that the aggrieved party was not a litigant. Likewise, in the case of a web designer worried about selling her services to a gay couple (who appear to be fabricated), the court defied every principle of standing. When the court goes beyond actual cases and controversies to answer hypotheticals, it goes beyond its constitutional mandate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, worst of all, the newfangled ""major questions doctrine"" allows the court to subjectively decide when the issue is of ""major political salience"" (whatever the court says it is); if so, the court demands the application at issue be specifically authorized by statute (a standard lawmakers somehow never meet in this court's eyes). It has become a crutch whenever the court seeks to invalidate a program it doesn't like. In the student debt relief case, the court reached the desired result by ignoring the word ""waive"" in the statute authorizing loan forgiveness to reach the finding that Congress hadn't delegated power to, well, waive student debt. ""[T]he Court once again substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch — and the hundreds of millions of people they represent — in making this Nation's most important, as well as most contested, policy decisions,"" Kagan wrote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mumbo-jumbo ""major questions doctrine"" is not the stuff of judging. No wonder the chief justice got touchy when Kagan pointed out that the court ""is supposed to stick to its business — to decide only cases and controversies and to stay away from making this Nation's policy about subjects like student-loan relief."" What the Slaughter-House Cases and substantive due process were to the New Deal-era right-wing court, the ""major questions doctrine"" is to the current court: a smokescreen for enforcing a right-wing agenda (or vetoing a progressive one).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In departing from the authentic judicial review, the right-wing majority unsurprisingly produces results perfectly aligned with the right's agenda on hot-button topics. (By the law of averages, its ""analysis"" should occasionally favor the other side.) When foretelling a case's outcome or following the majority's ""reasoning"" requires a crib sheet on GOP political aims, something is wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And voters have figured out what's going on. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 53 percent ""believe that the nation's highest court rules mainly on the basis of their partisan political view rather than on the basis of the law (33%), while 14% say they don't know."" Before the Dobbs opinion, a separate January 2022 poll showed that ""38% of Americans believed that the justices rule mainly on the basis of law, versus 43% who believed that the court rules on the basis of their political views.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The transformation of the court into a partisan player contradicts the central premise of democracy. We should reject the obtuse and naive argument that this court isn't so bad because it didn't entirely obliterate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and declined to impose the outrageous independent state legislature doctrine. Now is no time for self-delusion. Ending the right-wing majority's intolerable war on self-government will require that the other two branches and the voters cut the court down to size. A single election or a single reform might not suffice. Cogent law review articles, informed public debate and exquisite dissents revealing that the right-wing judicial emperors have no clothes can assist reformers. Term limits, jurisdiction stripping, court expansion and ethics reform should be on the table. Simply put, if we want democracy to survive, each election must be a referendum on the court's legitimacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Independence Day, which celebrates rebellion against a monarch lacking consent of the governed, it behooves us to dedicate ourselves to robust and authentic democracy — government of the people, by the people, for the people — not by arrogant right-wing justices.</p></div>"			2		3

So the gaffe will  soon wash over him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it's that other screw-up that is most illuminating -- the one that was overshadowed by his unfortunate Special Olympics wisecrack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama told Jay Leno he was surprised that those greedy AIG executives who helped lead the country into financial ruin were in line to receive $165 million in bonuses paid for by bailout cash authorized by his administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Stunned, stunned is the word,"" said Obama.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stunned?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that his Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who didn't pay all of his federal taxes but was still deemed worthy by Obama of collecting yours -- knew all about the AIG bonuses weeks ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was long before Washington Democrats began shrieking in pretend outrage over the bonuses, as if they didn't vote for them, sort of like Chicago aldermen shrieking about corruption from the 5th Floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's like Mayor Richard Daley saying, ""Gee, I dunno"" when news breaks that his nephews are in another multimillion-dollar government deal.

Those of us from Illinois can see it, what with City Hall guys pulling White House strings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then again, we're not surprised because we don't get the high-grade Hopium out here in the Midwest. The good stuff must be reserved for the Beltway media establishment, since they're the ones feeling  tingles running up their legs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even they'll figure out that the Chicago Way runs along Pennsylvania Avenue, once the Hopium wears off and the tingling stops. It'll probably take about eight years for their heads to clear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the meantime, all last week, the ludicrous Angry-Democrat-vs.-Greedy-AIG slapstick was highly entertaining, except when you realize the premise of the joke is that American taxpayers are so stupid we'll believe anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she'd tax those arrogant AIG guys and take the money back. This is the same Pelosi who is extremely wealthy, worth millions,  yet she jets coast to coast on weekends on your dime, because she's the speaker. Why doesn't she buy her own jet and have the unemployed AIG guys serve drinks to the real estate lobbyists?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At her news conference Thursday, Pelosi became so upset over AIG questions that she cut off reporters by saying, ""New subject, or else,"" and naturally, being under the influence of primo Hopium, they changed the subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But all this false congressional outrage and shrieking and fingerpointing should be understood for what it really is: Political buttocks-covering by Democrats who are worried about the 2010 elections, and afraid of losing their greatest symbolic weapon: The Evil Rich Guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's another cartoon, like Mr. Burns on ""The Simpsons,"" who steps on the backs of the humble working man. Now, though, the Democrats aren't fighting Mr. Burns, they're giving him a boost so he can step on our necks with a pair of snazzy AIG loafers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What they're trying to drown out with all their screaming is that the Democrats knew all about the $165 million to the AIG suits. And the Obama White House knew all about it too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, it was a rather brave New York Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley, who asked Geithner about the AIG bonuses in a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee. Not yesterday, or a couple days ago, but on March 3.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Just last month,"" Crowley told Geithner, ""AIG paid 343 employees of AIG FP -- their Financial Products division that created the financial hole that AIG is in, and in turn a multibillion-dollar bill for American taxpayers -- $56 million in bonuses and are slated to pay an additional $162 million in bonuses to 393 participants in the coming weeks,"" Crowley said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""And there's more,"" Crowley said.

63daabbd0ca8de9fc5709d1d	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt	"<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong — the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard’s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard’s tenured professors are white — 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the “Chinese virus” and most recently “kung flu.” Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never “leveled the playing field,” but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"		1						5

Maybe that's why, in this race of all-but-certain presidential nominees, I find myself distracted by Alan Keyes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or rather by the response of white conservative voters to Alan Keyes. I'm not suggesting that Keyes is likely to repeat in New Hampshire his startling showing in the Iowa caucuses--a third-place finish with 14 percent of the vote--much less that he'll still be battling George W. Bush for the Republican nomination as the party convention draws nearer. The subplot I've been following treats a much simpler question: Are white voters truly capable of looking beyond a black candidate's race?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black Americans seem certain that the answer is ""no,"" while white voters--on much the same evidence--believe it has long since been answered in the affirmative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Didn't we help elect David Dinkins mayor of New York City and Doug Wilder governor of Virginia? whites will say. And blacks will reply: Yes, but in substantial measure out of racial guilt--which means that it was, at bottom, a race-tinged vote. Similarly with elected officials from Massachusetts's Ed Brooke to Oklahoma's J. C. Watts, and with that most-popular of noncandidates, Colin Powell. I remember remarking, with utter seriousness, that the white-led bandwagon for Powell was a way for white people to prove to themselves they had gotten over their fixation on race. Now Alan Keyes has me wondering if I've gotten over mine.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A televised interview with a handful of Iowans after the Keyes surprise makes my point. The reporter was talking to these white conservatives--members of what we call the ""religious right""--and a couple of them were explaining how they compared Keyes and Gary Bauer and found Keyes's views more to their liking. One of the respondents mentioned that she'd like to see Keyes on the ticket of the eventual nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What struck me about that brief exchange was that it seemed genuinely to have nothing to do with race, only issues. And I was reminded by something in my long-repressed memory:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Strom Thurmond, as Old South and conservative as they come, standing up at those 1991 Judiciary Committee hearings for Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I don't imagine Thurmond was motivated by racial angst. Indeed, the Senate's 1,000-year-old man seemed indifferent to the fact that Thomas's white wife, Virginia, was a daily fixture at those hearings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He may have supported Thomas for reasons I would reject, but on this issue, at least, Strom Thurmond seemed, like that woman in Iowa, to have surmounted race in favor of political philosophy. I have to think it's a good thing--and too little recognized by those of us who insist we want to be judged by characteristics other than the color of our skins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But look how these conservatives get beyond race--by supporting African Americans whose views are anathema to the rank and file of black voters. Doesn't that demonstrate their disregard for what black people in general think? Doesn't it suggest that the only way they can forget our race is by supporting black folk who have forgotten it too?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what would we expect?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That these dyed-in-the-wool conservatives--who oppose a woman's right to choose abortion, who think <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is Satan's own tool and who never saw a new government initiative they didn't hate-- should get out the vote for Jesse Jackson Sr.?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't mean to suggest that all conservatives have retired their suspicions of racial minorities, or that racism and a certain brand of conservatism have been disentangled. I'm suggesting only that those of us who refuse to believe that white people can be conservative without being against black people may have some disentangling of our own to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And a modest bit of celebration. For if conservatives--the people we have always viewed as our dedicated enemies--are willing to move beyond our race to consider our character and our philosophy, why there may be hope for white liberals, too.</p></div>"			2				4	
5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2831679997.xml.txt	"<div><p>This Supreme Court pits us against them</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm picking out a suit to wear tonight because I'm going to a wedding for a longtime friend. We used to be roommates long ago, and she's finally marrying her partner of 10 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When she told me she was getting married, she did all the usual things that people who are about to be married do. She showed me a picture of her dress, and we talked about the kind of cake they were going to get. In the end, she and her partner decided they'd have a quick wedding in Las Vegas and then do another, more formal ceremony back east in the city where we live. That's this evening, and I'm happy for both of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I used the word ""partner"" in an attempt to be intentionally vague. But I'll tell you now that the bride is a cisgender woman. Her husband is a cisgender man. In short, it's the kind of wedding that conservatives believe is the only kind of wedding that counts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's a more complex aspect to their nuptials. She is bisexual and proudly so. It just so happens that she fell in love with a man. She has had many relationships with women. Had she fallen in love with a woman, it's quite possible that the seamstress could have refused to alter her dress, the bakery could have refused to make her a cake. But she avoided all of that by marrying a man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Supreme Court has been very busy lately making clear which kinds of people it truly values. By striking down Roe v. Wade, the justices showed us how much they value the opinions of women who want a say in their own health care. By striking down <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, they showed us how much they value White over Black and Brown students. By striking down student loan forgiveness, they demonstrated how much they value those who don't have enough money to avoid the Ponzi scheme called student loans. And today they essentially legalized the unequal treatment of LGBTQ people by holding that discrimination is a small price to pay if it lifts up just one kind of love.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This Supreme Court has become a conservative dreamland: Out of touch with the country and determined to satisfy conservatives who think they win only when someone else loses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lorie Smith, the Colorado web designer who refuses to make websites for LGBTQ people, may experience a boom in her business. This legal action was the best thing she could have done to make that happen. I don't know if she's a particularly good web designer or not, but I do know she will be lionized in some circles because she helped make people who conservatives don't like suffer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This need by conservatives is not about faith, really. It's about ensuring that Americans they don't know and don't like will suffer. They consider it a win for White people when Black and Brown people suffer. A win for men when women suffer. A win for older, richer people when younger, poorer people suffer. Everything in their minds is binary. We win. You lose. Black and white. And our current Supreme Court has become the favored weapon in their arsenal to bring about heartache for those they don't like.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it won't end here. Because whatever lines the justices may think they have carefully drawn during this term, their benefactors in the deep conservative world are just getting warmed up. Get ready for more: More behavior on your part that they will essentially outlaw. More things we're not allowed to teach. More roads for access unceremoniously cut off. More rights trampled on, and more barriers to discrimination lowered. Because the main priority of our conservative Supreme Court is to keep the status quo secure. Solid. And that means keeping certain people down.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, I will go to my friend's wedding in a few hours. And I will smile and have a good time, and I will be happy for her. There will be other LGBTQ friends of hers in attendance, and none of us would dream of sullying her day by reminding her that she's unintentionally made a choice that now, thanks to six people in Washington, places her above us in the American hierarchy of who matters most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was never put in a position to have her right to the pursuit of happiness questioned.</p></div>"			2					5
5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409060590.xml.txt	"<div><p>Ashcroft The Activist</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the nominee is technically qualified for the job and is, moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole thing seems to be missing the point. I have never doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would be unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is from that office that decisions are made on which laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland reassurances that Ashcroft would ""enforce the law fairly"" aren't much help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce America's drug laws ""fairly""? Does it mean locking up anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from enforcement to treatment -- or the other way around? Does it mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things -- allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and ""crack"" cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity that results from it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To promise to enforce the law without talking about which policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,  law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts. Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their own way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well outside the American mainstream -- on gun control, on abortion, on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by a significant minority. I say only that his views are unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating views that are well away from the political center and put him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to say he'll ""enforce the law.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine the Justice Department's standing before the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out of fear that his personal and religious views would influence his role as attorney general?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny him the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>) ""limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs the division.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will run the whole department?</p></div>"			2		3

5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409718670.xml.txt	"<div><p>Justices Too Tightlipped on Their Health?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the many issues raised by the Supreme Court's recent disclosure that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has cancer is how much information the court owes the public about the chief justice's health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only facts revealed -- that Rehnquist has one of several forms of thyroid cancer and that he received a tracheotomy at Bethesda Naval Hospital before being discharged Friday -- were enough to fuel speculation by medical experts about the 80-year- old's condition but not to settle the most pressing questions about the future of the chief justice, and of the court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court's terseness is consistent with its long tradition of discretion concerning justices' personal lives. With few exceptions - - in 1975, after a crippling stroke, Justice William O. Douglas held a news conference -- health information about the life-tenured members of the court is especially closely guarded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tradition was born in the days before the court played a central role in policymaking. But now, when the court has a role in everything from whether race can be considered in college admissions to the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, some are saying that tradition has to change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If the chief justice's medical prognosis is indeed such that he may not be able to finish this term, that's something the American people have a right to know, especially where you have dueling doctors speculating about the meaning of a tracheotomy,"" said David J. Garrow, a Supreme Court historian and professor of law at Emory University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""If it were [Speaker of the House] Dennis Hastert or [Senate Minority Leader] Tom Daschle, people would say there is an unchallengeable public right to know as much as the public official himself knows,"" Garrow said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But others defended the court's approach. They noted the constitutional differences between the judiciary and the other branches of government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The court operates according to a different rule,"" said Michael A. Carvin, a former Reagan administration Justice Department official. ""There is no constitutional transition issue like you have with the president. There is no day-to-day, commander-in-chief-type responsibility. You can operate the court on autopilot. You can't operate the presidency that way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also is possible that not even the chief justice is certain about his condition.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In my opinion, he owes the public whatever he gives the public,"" said Washington lawyer Charles J. Cooper, a former Rehnquist law clerk. ""He may still be finding things out himself.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SWINGER: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role on the court, long a matter of conventional wisdom among lawyers, has been confirmed by the latest quantitative methods of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a forthcoming North Carolina Law Review article, professors Andrew D. Martin, Kevin Quinn and Lee Epstein show not only that O'Connor is the court's ""median voter,"" but also that the 74-year- old has moved steadily to the left in recent years, taking the court with her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lot of math is involved, but basically the professors ranked justices on a numerical scale, assigning point values to their ideological leanings as shown through their votes. The higher the number, the more conservative the voting record.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2002, the last term covered by the study, Justice Clarence Thomas was the most conservative, with a score of 3.637; Justice John Paul Stevens, at -2.516, was the most liberal. O'Connor's score, 0.247, just a hair to the right of center, represented the court's midpoint. O'Connor's score has gone down steadily, or become more liberal, since 1994. In that year, she was at 0.637.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study also argues that, but for O'Connor's evolution, the court would not have approved of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, which it did in 2003, by a 5 to 4 vote, with O'Connor writing the majority opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to their calculations, the political scientists say, ""the likelihood of O'Connor providing the key vote to uphold the program was quite small for any term prior to 2001.""</p></div>"			2		3

Eurocentric Americans who oppose reparations for historically oppressed groups can count this new census data as a victory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not ""beat around the (George) bush"" by pretending that this transparent attempt to pass off racism as multicultural acceptance is a good thing for American society. These 57 census groups simply water down ethnic communities that have gained some degree of political power. Why are Germans who mix with Italians, who mix with Russians, who mix with British all considered ""white"" on the census? These multiethnic Americans of lighter hues have one category from which to choose and constitute one large voting bloc. Meanwhile, multiethnic Americans of darker hues are asked to divvy up 57 ways.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, I am African American and have always identified myself as such. Both my parents identified themselves the same way. However, if I were to get technical--as the census invites me to get- -I would have to check the box that said ""white, black, American Indian and Alaska native.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the white in my bloodline extends from slavery via non- consensual sex, white is still evident in my skin tone. Did the census mean to count that or only count more recent consensual interracial marriages? Do ""blacks"" have to have a close white relative, be raised by one, or simply embrace everyone who has contributed to their genetic makeup in order to qualify for the ""white-black"" box?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of clarity on this question makes the data collected invalid for the purpose of drawing conclusions. However, it will succeed at destroying ethnic community voting blocs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My great-grandfather was a full-blooded Native American. Will I qualify for more services if I claim him even though I don't know his culture? I doubt it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Modern political and economic forecasting is done through socio- economic lines more so than racial lines in today's culture. Perhaps we should abandon race identification altogether and inquire only about religion, education and income levels, all of which give us equally important information without race-baiting.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until the government clarifies the political need for these new 57 categories, all ethnic groups should continue to identify with the established traditional race categories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whites are not asked to divide their community into 57 multiethnic groups to better represent their diversity, so minority groups should not be asked to do so either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Felicia Clark is an educator with the Compton Unified School District</p></div>"			2					5
5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1023015447.xml.txt	"<div><p>Main Street: Chief Justice Roberts Taxes Credibility</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not once in the 59 pages that constitute Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts's lead opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius does he use the word ""integrity."" Even so, in the days since the individual mandate was upheld as a tax, concern for the ""integrity"" or ""legitimacy"" or ""reputation"" of the Roberts Court has become the most accepted explanation for why the chief justice ruled as he did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus Reuters, which tells us that Justice Roberts was ""trying to preserve the integrity of the judiciary in polarized Washington."" Or the New York Times, where Tom Friedman lauds the chief justice for ""a simple noble leadership impulse at a critical juncture in our history -- to preserve the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."" The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer agrees with this motivation, speculating that had Justice Roberts ""been just an associate justice, and not the chief"" he might well have voted otherwise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Krauthammer is correct, it raises a disquieting question. During Justice Roberts's confirmation hearings back in 2005, he described judges as umpires whose job it is to call balls and strikes as he sees them. The idea that he might have voted otherwise if he were not chief justice suggests that a ""strike"" was changed to a ""ball"" because of concerns for how the straight call would be perceived.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let us stipulate that there's nothing wrong with a justice who starts out with one opinion but changes his mind as he reviews the facts and arguments. Let us agree too that the reputation of the court is a legitimate concern of any justice. The fundamental difficulty remains: a labored lead opinion that looks like a conclusion struggling for a rationale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Justice Roberts tells us, we will never know for sure. Still, the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. For one thing, against the contrivance of the lead opinion there is the clarity of a united dissent that we now understand started out as a majority view with Justice Roberts's support. That clarity likewise characterizes two separate decisions by conservative federal appellate judges -- Laurence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton -- who upheld the individual mandate as a penalty under the Commerce Clause.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also hard not to notice that people now extolling Justice Roberts for rescuing the court's integrity are largely the same ones who have been impugning it. That's especially true of the White House, which had made plain that if the Supreme Court had gone the other way on health care, the Roberts Court would become a major target of Obama's re-election campaign. The chief justice knows how ugly that might be, having sat through the president's crass political attack on his court during the 2010 State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As more than one conservative has pointed out, the integrity of liberal justices who reliably line up for whatever outcome is desired by the Democratic Party goes unquestioned. Indeed, the definition of integrity assumes one direction. For example, the one notable occasion when the Supreme Court specifically invoked integrity was back in 1992 (Planned Parenthood v. Casey), when the court used it to justify reaffirming Roe v. Wade's conclusion -- a constitutional right to abortion -- while rejecting the reasoning that led to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, in that case the court was deferring to a previous judicial power grab and not to the people acting through their elected representatives. Still, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's clarifying rebuke is well worth reprising here: ""Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception -- a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers -- the Justices should do what is legally right.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Scalia's dissent in Casey illuminates a political handicap imposed on conservatives by their own principles. Whereas the liberal belief in a living Constitution allows them to stretch its limits to justify almost any desired outcome, conservatives believe the Constitution imposes real limits. The chief justice's tax argument rankles because no one else in America is buying it: certainly not the conservative dissenters, who firmly reject it, nor the court liberals, who appear to have winked because it gave them the outcome they wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The day after the ruling came down, this newspaper carried an article that explained Justice Roberts's decision this way: ""By confounding charges that the court is too partisan, the chief justice might have earned sufficient political capital to move to the right during the next term, when the court will likely confront a host of hot-button issues, including <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage and the continued vitality of the Voting Rights Act.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If earning ""sufficient political capital"" is simply a consequence of his ruling, Justice Roberts cannot be blamed. If it was the aim, however, and it led to his voting as chief justice in a way he would not have voted as an associate justice, he has raised rather than resolved questions about the integrity of the Roberts court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"			2		3			
5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1011079659.xml.txt	"<div><p>Conservative cliches</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many of us who pontificate for a living, my column-writing colleague Jonah Goldberg apparently toils away in daily frustration that so many people fail to take his political advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would explain his new book, which takes on one of the world's least threatening problems, the political cliches that many people utter as a substitute for original thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is titled ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas."" With a title like that, need I bother to mention that the author is a conservative?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As such, he focuses on the cliches that trouble him most, and they happen to be those that he has heard uttered by liberals. That's sort of like reading Playboy for the articles; it's interesting, but something important is missing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I do agree that some cliches like ""violence never settles anything"" need to go, at least until we find a good substitute for the word ""never."" In fact, history offers many examples of violence settling things, although not always in ways that were expected by its initiators. Vietnam, Iraq and the secession of the Confederacy come immediately to mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the more of Goldberg's book I read, the more appreciation I feel for the pithy power of the bumper-sticker truisms he ridicules.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I like, for example, the old chestnut, ""Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer."" Goldberg responds, ""So you won't mind if those 10 guilty men move next door to you?"" Sure, but why blame the innocent guy for the 10 guilty guys next door? I would blame our criminal justice system for its failure to do what taxpayers pay them to do: Protect not only our lives and property but also our constitutional rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This barroom argument would not annoy me as much if there were not 289 exonerations of convicted individuals thanks to DNA evidence since 1989, according to the Innocence Project. The DNA era confirms some of our worst fears: We're getting the worst of both worlds; innocents are suffering while the guilty go free. And Goldberg gets to joke about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author doesn't like ""Diversity is strength,"" either. (""Cool,"" he writes. ""The NBA should have a quota for midgets and one-legged point guards!"") Yet without getting into the deep weeds of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debates, this country has prospered as a result of its mulligan stew of ethnics -- its Pages and Goldbergs, etc., etc. -- and our ability, more often than not, to work together with a sense of common purpose despite our differences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And surely Goldberg is not serious in his potshots at this old gem: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Sure, he writes, ""if the other man is an idiot."" But, so what? An idiot can kill you just as dead as a sane man can. And even the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was viewed as a terrorist by those whose segregated way of life he set out to upset.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I would argue that one person's cliche is another person's wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To illustrate and offer a bit of balance to what Goldberg has initiated, here are a few of the most annoying cliches, in my view, that I often hear from the political right:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""We don't solve problems by throwing money at them."" Sure. But you don't solve many problems by sucking money out of them either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Poor people need to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps."" Easier said than done, my friend. I tried to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and almost tumbled over on my head.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Keep the government's hands off of my Medicare."" Not easy. You'll have better luck with your bootstraps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Liberals love free speech as long as it supports the left."" Unlike conservatives, who love free speech as long as it does not come from the Quran or the Dixie Chicks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""America: Love It Or Leave It."" Funny, but I haven't heard that one much since President Barack Obama's election. Can we bring it back?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* ""Why are all the news media slanted to the left -- except Fox News?"" Maybe Stephen Colbert got it right. He said, ""Reality has a liberal bias.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was a joke. It's not a cliche, yet. But give it time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board and blogs at chicagotribune.com/pagespage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>cpage@tribune.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @cptime</p></div>"			2				4	
5eee84b62f2451148cb708b2	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2417314051.xml.txt	"<div><p>Op-Ed: Why California needs affirmative action more than ever</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In November, a new generation of California voters will have the opportunity to restore <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in the state. Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 will be on the ballot, giving voters the chance to repeal Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race, sex or ethnicity in public employment, contracting and education in 1996, nearly a quarter of a century ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hail ACA 5 as a way to address historical and systematic racial, ethnic and gender inequalities, while opponents decry it as a form of categorical discrimination that privileges race and gender over merit. One contingent of opponents are politically conservative Asian immigrants, who claim that reinstating <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will harm their children by placing an Asian quota on university admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This view is wrong — the amendment will not result in racial quotas of any kind, which have been ruled unconstitutional since 1978. In fact, reversing Proposition 209 will help, not harm, Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Proposition 209 did not increase the rate of Asian American admissions to the University of California system. Instead, Asian Americans were admitted at nearly the same rate before and after the ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. The group that had the largest decline in admissions were white people, while Latinos had the largest gain. Asian American and African American admissions rates remained largely the same.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, by focusing solely on university admissions, Asian American opponents fail to consider how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in other domains, such as employment, is needed to break through blocked mobility and the career ceiling they face. College-educated, U.S.-born Asians fall behind their white counterparts in earnings, and also behind all groups in advancement beyond entry-level professional positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent reports of top technology firms in Silicon Valley show that Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted into managerial and executive positions. White men and women are twice as likely as Asian men and women, respectively, to advance into the executive ranks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar pattern emerges in law where Asians make up 10% of graduates of top-30 law schools, but only 6.5% of all federal judicial law clerks. And while they are the largest minority group in major law firms, Asian Americans have the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even in academia, where Asian Americans are overrepresented as students in elite universities, they are nearly absent in leadership ranks, making up only 2% of college presidents, far below the percentage of Black and Latino college presidents at 8% and 4%, respectively. Asians are not well represented among the ranks of tenured professors either. Take Harvard, for example, which is fighting a court case to keep <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in place. The current freshman class is 25% Asian American, but among Harvard’s tenured professors, only 11% are Asian. And there is a stark gender divide: 8% are Asian men, and a mere 3% are Asian women. By far, the majority of Harvard’s tenured professors are white — 80%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, the race-neutral policies are ineffective in addressing racial realities, as Asian Americans are finding as they confront the rise in anti-Asian hate since the outbreak of COVID-19. President Trump has stoked anti-Asian discrimination by calling it the “Chinese virus” and most recently “kung flu.” Nearly 1,900 cases of Asian harassment have been reported, ranging from verbal insults to beatings and stabbings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, the majority of Asian Americans recognize the continued significance of race. Nearly two-thirds of Asian American registered voters support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>: 65% favored or strongly favored <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, with only 25% opposed or strongly opposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S.-born Asians, and especially third-and-higher-generation Asians (those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.), are significantly more likely to support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Asian immigrants, according to the 2016 National Asian American Survey. More recent immigrants may be less likely to understand the origins of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, and also less likely to experience the effects of systematic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s crucial that this new generation of Asian Americans advocates for a more equitable opportunity structure that will help them and all marginalized populations, including in higher education, contracting and the workplace. Anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> laws like Proposition 209 never “leveled the playing field,” but instead reinforced patterns of historic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of Asian Americans have shown time and again that they support <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. They will need to prove their support in November at the ballot box.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jennifer Lee is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the Eastern Sociological Society.</p></div>"		1						5
