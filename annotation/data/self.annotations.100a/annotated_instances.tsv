sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/424669038.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Editorial Notebook; Morris Abram, LBJ and Neutrality</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were nervous, milling about in Lyndon Johnson's White House.  When was the last time a President had called together the press secretaries of all the departments? What did he want? He marched in, big, brown-suited and angry, and told them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was tired, he said, of being compared unfavorably with John Kennedy, especially on civil rights. JFK had a fine record, he said.  But so, dammit, did he. ''Some day,'' he thundered, ''you'll tell your grandchildren you were proud to have been part of the Johnson Administration.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His words came to mind last week when Morris Abram testified on his nomination to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The testimony, like Lyndon Johnson's civil rights record, turns on one of the great unsettled issues of our time: <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It underlies almost every aspect of modern race relations - and it remains open as America struggles over how much to do to relieve the enduring effects of slavery and bigotry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Morris Abram is a lifelong enemy of that bigotry. To imply otherwise does injustice to a man of public, and private, courage.  But the respect due a man of principle need not extend to his every principle. And when it comes to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, the position he enunciated again last week is technical, bloodless, uncharacteristically ungenerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To him, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is permissible only if neutral. He believes ''it is morally and legally wrong to discrimate against any person or to discriminate in favor of any person.'' To do otherwise is to concur in ''governmentally enforced quotas.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quotas offend him deeply because Racism Is Different.  So Is the Case For Preference the power to prefer one group today is the power to prefer another tomorrow. Other aggrieved minorities, including white ethnic groups, will demand special treatment, setting the stage ''for conflict - and tragedy.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do other minorities have grounds for complaint? Of course. American life is punctuated with signs that read ''No Irish Need Apply'' or with anti-Jewish quotas at medical schools. But Mr. Abram evidently finds it hard to distinguish these grievances from the relentless racism of centuries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even conceding that, Mr. Abram still thinks it wrong for government to give preference to one group. Yet government does that all the time. As Justice Blackmun observed in the Bakke case, government regularly gives preferences to veterans, the handicapped, Indians and, with the progressive income tax, to many others. ''In order to get beyond racism,'' he wrote, ''we must first take account of race.  There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's every reason for the present generation of Americans to try conscientiously to redress the enduring wrongs of our past. And, if we want more than proclamations of virtue, we need a way of keeping score.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Abram does not oppose remedial action. He insists that he is for, if not <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, at least ''social assistance.'' For instance, he would provide job training to all who would work but lack the skills. But then why shrink from devising ways to open up jobs, too? To Mr. Abram, that raises the hateful idea of quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Attaching numbers to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> need not - should not - mean guaranteed numerical outcomes. It is a way to make institutions accountable, to measure their honest efforts to find minority employees, students, applicants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Abram is entitled to his chilly neutrality. What he is not entitled to do is cite Lyndon Johnson in its defense. If one really wants to know what Lyndon Johnson thought of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, head and heart, one should recall his words at Howard University in 1965, words that have not been improved on since:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Freedom is not enough ...You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been competely fair. Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates ....</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough. Men and women of all races are born with the same range of abilities. But ability is not just the product of birth ...It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child, and finally the man.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Freedom is not enough, Mr. Abram. Equal opportunity is not enough.  Neither is neutrality.</p></div>"		1				5

Historically, it celebrates a lone Mexican victory in a war that Mexico lost: On May 5, 1862, in Puebla, Mexico, an indigent indigenous force under Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza (who was born in Texas when that state was part of Mexico) defeated a French expeditionary force, at that time part of the most powerful army in the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, Cinco de Mayo has become a colorful springtime fiesta that is fast spreading throughout the country with all the commercial trimmings of other U.S. holidays.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, in light of Mexico's financial and political agonies, the anti-immigration Proposition 187 and the anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> initiative, it's ironic or painful to be celebrating a Mexican holiday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, it should serve to jog our memories of how close we are to Mexico. From San Ysidro on the border to Santa Rosa in the north, from Santa Cruz on the coast to San Bernardino in the desert, California claims 57 towns and cities named after santos. To paraphrase a popular aphorism: Poor California, with so many santos and so far from God! Gov. Wilson would probably add, ""And so close to Mexico.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is my adopted state, by virtue of a mixed marriage. I'm from Texas, she's from California. This remarkable state has grown on me the way I outgrew Texas, years layered one over the other. I now admit a love for California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Texas, it was a love-hate relationship. Relations between Texans and Texanos were pitched with overt racism, not the subtle style I found here 20 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, Proposition 187 and the anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> initiative make me feel like I'm right back in Texas. There's a vigilante mood here not unlike that of a century ago. Even Texans are surprised at California's vehemence and, being more experienced, are wooing Mexican business away from Califas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, my attachment to California is so strong that I feel magnetized. I feel it through a melancholic sadness, an enchanting nostalgia for the California that has always been there, through the cities and towns named after spiritual ghosts, through the floods, earthquakes, fires and riots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a mysterious energy that drives California to lead the nation in spiritual and temporal fashions, in sensational crimes, lifestyles, inventions and discoveries. Some believe it is the massive fields of energy from the ocean, from the deep blue sky or the energy that seeps up through the faults in the earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My California dreams began in the late 1940s in west Texas. Our home was on a street that turned into the highway that led beyond the New Mexico sunsets. We were always waving goodby to family friends and their kids, piled into ancient cars on their way to the golden state of opportunity, to California. A year or two later, some would return from California to culture-shock us. I had never seen Mexican women in hip-hugging pedal-pushers. The kids no longer spoke Spanish. The men showed off their late-model station wagons boasting California license plates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California was the coolest. During the '50s, a time of adolescent innocence, everything from California was cool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Texas, you could spot a California short-sleeve shirt a block away by the color and design. ""California threads?"" we would ask any proud vato wearing a snappy camisa. We would rub the cloth between our fingers. From there, our fingers would walk up to the shirt pocket, pull out a cigarette from his pack, and say ""Nice shirt, man! California?"" It became a way to bum cigarettes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Texanos had always identified as Mexicanos, Mexican Americans; in the barrios and the military, it was always Chicanos. When the Chicano movement exploded in California, many of us ridiculed those psuedo-""Dons"" with dark Indian faces asserting their ""Spanish"" heritage. But it wasn't long before I was swept by the crusading likes of modern Californios such as Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Ernesto Galarza, Ignacio Lopez, Luisa Moreno and Bert Corona. Other crusaders came along: Vilma Martinez, Antonia Hernandez, Herman Gallegos, Alurista and Jose Montoya, farm workers, attorneys, union activists, artists, poets-all migrants and immigrants, not one of these leaders born in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They reckoned this had to be their land after working its soil. They had grown to love the campos and the towns named after the santos their mothers and grandmothers lit votive candles and prayed to when their children migrated to California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it's ours. We are Californians. And in this state that would rank as the third-most-populated Spanish-speaking country in the world, we can say, proudly and happily, Viva el Cinco de Mayo!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: JOSE ANTONIO BURCIAGA</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Antonio Burciaga is a Northern California writer, the author of ""Drink Cultura"" and ""Spilling the Beans,"" to be published in June by Joshua Odell Editions, Santa Barbara.</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398538903.xml.txt	"<div><p>Useful distinctions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The phrase ""useful distinction"" seems to have lost its usefulness. It described a way of trying to think precisely about problems and weighing competing claims. But today our system generally seems to operate at the level of ""all or nothing."" The Gingrich tax-exempt affair, for example, was immediately driven to the level of Watergate. Something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the California Civil Rights Initiative on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly and the other sponsors of CCRI have formed the American Civil Rights Institute to take their initiative campaign against government-sponsored quotas and set-asides nationwide. They're being bitterly opposed by the forces and groups who give the strong impression that merely to raise questions about the status of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is to commit sin beyond forgiveness. But the fact is that CCRI passed, with nearly 30% of blacks voting for it. Our sense of the public mood is that all-or-nothing proponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> need to start making some useful distinctions in public. Such balancing considerations are raised explicitly by the case of Astroline Communications Company.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Astroline was a limited partnership that in 1984 gained control of WHCT, Channel 18, a TV station in Hartford. The partnership benefited from the FCC's ""minority distress sale policy,"" which gives preferential treatment in assigning certain broadcast licenses to companies in which a minority owns a 20% equity stake and exercises ""complete control over the station's affairs."" That policy was challenged in court on constitutional grounds by a competitor for the Channel 18 license, Alan Shurberg.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to his suit, a federal appeals court struck down the FCC's policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. But the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the FCC set-asides in a 1990 decision, Metro Broadcasting v. FCC. Writing for a 5-4 majority, then-Justice William Brennan held that the set-aside policy was legitimate because it achieved ""the important government objective of broadcast diversity."" This represented the high-water mark of the Supreme Court's support for racial preferences. But in Adarand Constructors v. Pena (1995), the newly constituted Court essentially reversed Metro Broadcasting and raised almost insurmountable barriers to government set-aside programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To see why the court's new color-blind policy in this area makes sense, let's look at facts that have come to light about Astroline Broadcasting. The company has gone into bankruptcy, eventually making its tax records available to Mr. Shurberg, who continues his quest to win the license. In a petition filed with the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Mr. Shurberg contends that Astroline wasn't exactly what it claimed to be.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it won its license, Astroline did have a minority who owned the requisite 21% of the company -- its general manager, Richard Ramirez. But according to the tax records, Mr. Ramirez's stake in the company declined to 0.75% by the following year. The records also indicate that Mr. Ramirez, Astroline's ostensible owner, invested exactly $210 in the company. His partners -- all apparently ""non-minorities,"" according to Mr. Shurberg -- contributed more than $23 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramirez acknowledges in an interview that he put up only $210, but says that he also added ""sweat equity"" and that he never gave up control of the company. ""It's preposterous to claim that I didn't run that business,"" he says. Eventually this will be resolved by the FCC and the courts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the world of all-or-nothing, the complaints of an Alan Shurberg against the gaming of set-asides have no chance of support from <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> proponents. But a point arrives in an open system like ours, with news widely available, that one's cause begins to develop problems of credibility. People who watched the Texaco case unfold now see big-money class actions being filed that allege racist e-mail in other companies. But then when a CCRI-like effort emerges, its supporters are attacked as loonies beyond discussion. Under the circumstances, a revival of ""useful distinctions"" looks very much in order.</p></div>"	2						3

Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an ""Antiracist Audit"" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which ""strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion—that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways—as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism—he does—but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. ""I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,"" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue—from sexuality to crime to immigration—is discussed through ""a racial equity lens,"" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of ""divisive concepts"" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that ""members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also ""not limited"" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the ""1619"" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teaching multiple perspectives and the ""1619"" and ""1776"" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry. Students could read Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller ""How to Be an Antiracist"" alongside one of the many articles or books by writers like Messrs. Loury, McWhorter and Patterson. Kids would hear theories about ""systems of oppression,"" but they would also hear about the role that class and cultural differences play in disparity. In short, they would receive multiple narratives and explanations about why America is the way it is today and decide for themselves what to think and do about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my kids to get a good education. That means exposing them to ideas that some on the right want banned and other ideas that some on the left actively demonize. That's a true American education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bernstein is founder of the Jewish Institute for Liberal Values.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teach '1619' and '1776' U.S. History</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By David Bernstein</p></div>"	2						3

What's the ABA doing supporting abortion rights, endorsing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and now calling for a death penalty moratorium? Congressman Chris Cox wrote a trenchant article for the Weekly Standard recently exposing in detail how the ABA's liberal agenda skews its evaluations of judicial nominees. But another area where the nation's largest organization of lawyers has gone off the tracks hasn't gotten nearly enough attention -- the ABA is actively promoting an anti-business agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same meeting earlier this month where the ABA adopted the anti-death penalty plank, its House of Delegates also endorsed a resolution on class actions. The resolution favors making it easier to certify class actions for settlement purposes, and opposes a proposal to rein in ""coupon"" settlements unless the ""litigation's probable deterrence value"" is taken into account. In other words the ABA thinks the public is being well-served by settlements -- such as those in the notorious Ford Bronco II and airline price-fixing cases -- where the plaintiffs' lawyers reap millions while their ostensible clients collect coupons worth almost nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nobody should be surprised, since the ABA has a long record of opposing any effort to improve the tort system. According to a summary compiled by the Federalist Society, the ABA opposes a loser pays rule; opposes any limits on pain and suffering awards; opposes a ""ceiling"" on medical malpractice damages; and opposes product liability reform. In effect, then, the ABA wants to let plaintiffs' lawyers continue extorting billions from American companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As if to add insult to (personal) injury, the ABA has also gone on record  favoring a long list of government mandates on business: universal health care, protection from discrimination for HIV patients, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the like. The group has even called for the creation of ""a federal agency to advocate the views of consumers,"" a long-standing Naderite pipe dream. Is there any pro-business idea that finds favor with the pooh-bahs of the ABA? Oh yes, there is one: The ABA supported Nafta.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ABA resolutions aren't just empty words. The ABA has a corps of paid lobbyists who are authorized to support the stances taken by its House of Delegates. And these lobbyists were active in opposing Republican efforts to pass civil justice reform as part of the ""Contract with America."" Who can forget the ABA president describing the new GOP Congressional majority in 1995 as ""reptilian bastards.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some will no doubt say: Well what do you expect from a bunch of lawyers? They want to preserve their honey pot, so they don't want to change the tort system. A realistic, if cynical, assessment. But the ABA itself claims that it's not merely a special pleader for lawyers; after all, it somehow finds the moral authority to instruct the rest of America on how to run foreign and social policy. The group even has a quasi-governmental function: It certifies lawyers and law schools, and regulates their conduct. The ABA also formally advises the President and Senate on judicial nominations. By backing the plaintiffs' bar, the ABA is not only casting doubt on its ability to carry out these functions fairly and impartially, but it's also sticking it to a large portion of its membership: lawyers who work for businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bunch of Fortune 500 general counsels were sufficiently alarmed about the ABA's drift that they convened a summit meeting last year with the organization's leaders. The powwow didn't accomplish much. The ABA, for instance, still refuses to adopt a proposal limiting contingency fees endorsed by heavyweights ranging from Robert Bork to Robert Pitofsky. This group wants the ABA, which already bars ""unreasonable"" fees, to stipulate that it's unethical for a lawyer to take one-third of a plaintiff's award if the case was so simple that he didn't have to do much work or take much risk. No dice. Apparently the ABA is more interested in opposing nuclear weapons than contingency fees, which happen to be the engine driving much of the liability explosion of recent decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But then the ABA doesn't believe there is a liability explosion. Not long ago, the group put out a lengthy pamphlet of ""Facts About the Civil Justice System,"" which claims there hasn't been an increase in personal injury suits. As evidence, the pamphlet points out that tort litigation has slightly decreased since 1990. The brochure doesn't bother to mention another fact: tort filings have increased dramatically since 1984.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such selective use of evidence reveals the ABA's deep and abiding bias in favor of runaway litigation. Given that slant, it's hard for us to see why anybody should take seriously the ABA's opinions on judges or any other subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: ABA's Solid Stand On Business Issues"" -- WSJ March 19, 1997)</p></div>"	2								2
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/399055159.xml.txt	"<div><p>How Jesse Helms Made a Difference</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Ronald Reagan was the sunny and optimistic face of modern conservatism, the uncompromisingly defiant exemplar of it was Jesse Helms, who died yesterday at age 86.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan has undergone a revisionist makeover by many historians who now recognize his accomplishments, Helms is still the conservative liberals most love to hate. But while they still disdain his views, many liberal groups are now using their own forms of the rhetorical and campaign techniques that Helms honed to perfection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jesse Helms was an influential television commentator in North Carolina when he decided to leave the Democratic Party, winning a U.S. Senate seat as a Republican in 1972. He went on to win four more terms, with a reputation as the Senate's most principled warrior on behalf of social conservatism, anti-Communism, limits on union power, and an assertive foreign policy that rejected State Department caution. Like Reagan, many of his views appear to have been validated. Others, such as his blind spot on racial issues and mean-spirited comments against gays were troublesome, but even the stubborn Helms made moves to modify his image in those areas late in life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two events early in his Senate career showcased Helms's unflinching nature and his political skills. In 1975, he engineered a visit to the U.S. by Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn over the objections of the State Department, which forbade its own employees from attending a major Solzhenitsyn speech in Washington. State also blocked a proposed visit to the White House, leading Helms to accuse President Gerald Ford of ""cowering timidly for fear of offending Communists.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That incident helped spur Reagan to challenge Ford for the GOP nomination the next year. Reagan lost the first five primaries, and he entered the North Carolina contest broke and under pressure to pull out. But Helms and his chief strategist Tom Ellis refused to give up. They employed Helms's huge, direct-mail list to build a grass-roots army of volunteers and raise money to air 30-minute speeches by Reagan across the state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Emphasizing the Panama Canal ""giveaway"" and smaller government, Reagan won an upset victory and was able to battle Ford all the way to the GOP convention. He showed such strength at the convention that Ford invited him to deliver off-the-cuff remarks to the delegates. Reagan was so inspiring that some of Ford's own delegates exclaimed, ""We just nominated the wrong candidate."" Reagan later acknowledged how Helms's intervention rescued his political career.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that level of success eluded Helms in a Senate where he was almost always outvoted. Rather than seek compromise, he staked out firm positions that attracted publicity for his causes. He was often able to block appointments he considered too liberal and was the first to highlight United Nations corruption, an issue on which he was clearly ahead of his time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also stumbled. His anticommunist fervor led him to back authoritarian regimes in Chile and Argentina far more than he should have. His 1983 opposition to a Martin Luther King holiday -- he railed against King's associations with communists -- was myopic and a throwback to a discredited past.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue of race will always cast a shadow on Helms's legacy. He could never understand why he was viewed by many as a bigot, having run one of the most integrated TV stations in the South and often hiring blacks on his staff. His criticisms of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and forced busing were on the mark. But as conservative scholar John Hood notes, ""he failed to marry every criticism of government overreaching with calls for the South's social and moral transformation and clear denunciations of racist business owners.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the mainstream media rarely put Helms's career in context the way they did, for example, with Sam Ervin, a Democrat who served with Helms in the Senate from North Carolina before retiring in 1975. Ervin was the leading legal strategist against Civil Rights legislation, and he largely crafted the Southern Manifesto against Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. But Ervin was the man who chaired the Watergate hearings that helped bring down Richard Nixon, and his views on civil rights were almost never mentioned. Both Helms and Ervin were courtly, principled conservatives. Only one became a cartoon media villain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to his reputation, Helms did change his mind. For his first decade in office he opposed aid to Israel and in 1982, after that nation invaded Lebanon, called for ""shutting down"" relations. But after learning more about Israel's security fears during a visit there in 1985, and receiving assurances that officials there could support some military sales to moderate Arab nations, he became Israel's stalwart ally. ""It was a complete switch,"" recalls Morris Amitay, former executive director of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Helms also softened on both AIDS and Africa. He developed an unlikely friendship with the rock star Bono, who convinced Helms to back AIDS funding and alleviate poverty in Africa by channeling more foreign aid through private sources.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that kind of detente was rare. Most liberals delighted in baiting Helms and he reciprocated: He crowed about how disappointed CBS anchor Dan Rather looked in announcing his upset victory on election night in 1990. But liberals did pay attention to Helms, and gradually adopted some of his methods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was Helms who first sent his own foreign policy advisers overseas to second-guess the executive branch's foreign policy. Many liberals have no qualms in doing the same today. One liberal consultant told me he learned from Helms's ability to distill complicated ideas to a level that connected with ordinary people. His mastery of new media techniques and technology convinced many liberals they had to invest in the Internet and build up the passions of their base.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jesse Helms was a major influence on American conservatism, but his career provides a blueprint for anyone who represents an embattled minority viewpoint. You can, with persistence and unflinching determination, change the political odds in your favor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Fund is a columnist for WSJ.com.</p></div>"	2								2
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409129544.xml.txt	"<div><p>Bush's Political Smarts</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several less than fully flattering reasons one can point to for the steady and large gains in public opinion made by President Bush: (1) He benefits from surpassing exceedingly low expectations; (2) he benefits from surpassing an exceedingly low predecessor; (3) he benefits from an easy and shallow charm, which is useful in winning over an easy and shallow press corps; and (4) he possesses the narrow mind's narrow focus, which naturally concentrates his administration's energies and the public's attention on the priorities of his agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is true, but there is more to Bush's good times. There is, of all things, intelligence. Bush is, on one level, no toy rocket scientist. ""Is our children learning?"" he asked during the campaign. Oh, they is, but not, we hope, grammar from you, sir. As it happens, the level on which Bush is not intellectually impressive is the only one that most journalists respect: verbal intelligence, the ability to understand and manipulate logic and language. This is precisely the sort of intelligence Bush does not possess, and so, many journalists stupidly thought of Bush as, well, stupid. I include myself in this and hereby renounce and regret my repeated past use, in connection with Bush, of the word ""pinhead.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bush does possess is political intelligence -- the ability to understand and manipulate people and situations. Verbal intelligence and political intelligence are not necessarily connected: Think of the Mayor Daleys, father and son. It appears that this is so with Bush. The best evidence of this is that he has shown a grasp of the same essential dynamic of politics that brought success to his immediate predecessor -- the dynamic of triangulation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Bill Clinton knew and what it seems Bush knows is that there are three groups of voters: a core who will vote for you if, and only if, you satisfy their nonnegotiable ideological demands; a contrapuntal anti-core, whom you can never win over but whom you may discourage; and swing voters. To win, you must satisfy the core, blunt the drive and reach of the anti-core and make yourself minimally acceptable to a majority of the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obvious, of course, but in practice, not so. Clinton brilliantly grasped the subtleties of the thing. He understood that (a) the core's nonnegotiable needs were actually very few; meet those needs absolutely and always and the core would grant you vast leeway on every other issue; (b) the post-'60s Democratic Party, forgetting this, had assumed all sorts of demands to be nonnegotiable and had thereby saddled itself with all sorts of unpopular positions (in areas such as welfare, crime and use of military force); thus (c) making it impossible for it to win a majority of the swing. So Clinton made himself the unwavering champion of his core's nonnegotiables (<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, unfettered abortion, identity group representation in the distribution of power and perks). Everything else he threw up for grabs, and in the process threw away all the bad old issues that kept Democrats marginalized, and won back the swing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush is now doing the same thing in reverse. Like Clinton, Bush knows that he must satisfy his core's nonnegotiables; he has moved unwaveringly to do this, most importantly on abortion and on taxes. Like Clinton, he knows that most of the swings want a nondivisive, ""nice"" president, and that giving ground on contentious issues will please the swing, weaken the standing of the anti-core and be tolerated by the core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider Bush's support for an end to racial profiling in law enforcement. The core might regard that as giving in to race demagoguery, but it doesn't regard this as a nonnegotiable. To Bush's anti-core, though, racial profiling is a vital concern -- in fact, a nonnegotiable. The swings, meanwhile, just don't want to waste time and energy fighting about the thing. Thus, with one move, Bush's administration weakened its anti-core, which is depending heavily on selling the canard of Bush as a racist president, and pleased the swing, while not losing the slightest support with its core.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is politics played on a high and nuanced plane of intelligence, the sort of level that signifies a natural ability -- natural political smarts. George W. Bush: smart guy. Who knew?</p></div>"			3					6

Sen. Hatch, the GOP chairman, is investigating the leak of Democratic strategy memos on President Bush's blocked nominees to the federal appeals courts. The staff memos document the extraordinary influence of liberal special-interest groups on Democratic members of Judiciary. The Journal published excerpts on Nov. 14.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before I continue the tale of the unfortunate non-leaker, let me say a word about the memos themselves. If you haven't been reading this page, chances are you haven't heard of them. They are the talk of Capitol Hill, but virtually every mainstream media outfit -- the Washington Times being an exception -- has declined to inform readers about what's in them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow it's impossible to imagine such media nonchalance had the memos come from GOP staffers recounting, say, Pfizer's game plan for how senators could get a Medicare prescription drug benefit passed. Proof of GOP collusion with big business would lead the news for days.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But evidence of how liberal interest groups are colluding with Democrats to decide which judges get through and which don't doesn't qualify as ""news."" Instead, the press has been only too happy to help the Democrats change the subject from the substance of the memos to the nonissue of how they ended up on the editorial page of the Journal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's review. The memos -- from 2001-02 when the Democrats controlled Judiciary under the chairmanship of Sen. Patrick Leahy -- show the senators took their marching orders from People for the American Way, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL Pro-Choice America and the NAACP. No surprise here, as anyone who's been following the course of Mr. Bush's stalled nominees knows full well. But the extent of the groups' micromanagement is eye-popping and exposes the opposition to Mr. Bush's judicial picks for what it really is: political maneuvering, not principled differences of opinion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most blatant example is Miguel Estrada, Mr. Bush's former nominee for the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. ""The groups"" object to Mr. Estrada ""because he has a minimal paper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him for a Supreme Court appointment,"" a Nov. 7, 2001, memo to Sen. Dick Durbin explains. Or, as talking points prepared for Sen. Ted Kennedy put it: ""We can't repeat the mistake we made with Clarence Thomas."" Mr. Estrada withdrew his name from consideration in September, after seven attempts to bring his name to a floor vote failed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And then there's the Sixth Circuit, where Democrats were asked to delay nominees not because they weren't qualified but because their confirmation might influence the outcome of a particular case. Talk about politicalization of the judiciary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five nominations -- all for slots designated judicial emergencies -- were pending on April 17, 2002, when a memo explained that Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund wanted Sen. Kennedy to ""hold off"" on any nominee until the Sixth Circuit voted on the U-Michigan <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> case. To quote: ""The thinking is that the current 6th Circuit will sustain the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program, but if a new judge with conservative views is confirmed before the case is decided, that new judge will be able, under 6th Circuit rules, to review the case and vote on it.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now back to the accused staffer. The excerpts from the memos appeared in the Journal on a Friday. By Monday, Democrats had succeeded in turning the spotlight away from the memos and onto the leaks. In this, they had the help of two unlikely allies: Chairman Hatch and Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist. Sen. Frist knew the Medicare bill was coming up for debate that week and, as one Republican insider explains, he wanted ""to keep the partisanship down."" Remember -- this is the GOP leadership's response to Democratic memos containing such niceties as ""most of Bush's nominees are nazis.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Sunday night, Nov. 16, the two GOP leaders authorized the Capitol Police to secure the committee's server room and obtain backup copies of the computer tapes on which staffers' files were kept. Over the next week two federal prosecutors conducted interviews of 50 committee staffers. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Hatch announced that he was putting an unnamed GOP staffer on administrative leave ""pending the outcome of the full investigation."" The next step is for forensic computer experts to evaluate the tapes. The total cost of placating the Democrats is expected to add up to $500,000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement put out last week by Mr. Hatch's office says that the accused staffer ""improperly accessed at least some of the documents referenced in the media reports."" That accusation bears scrutiny in light of how the committee's computer system is organized: Until Nov. 16, all Judiciary staffers used the same computer server and had access to a shared drive, a system put in place when Sen. Leahy took over as chairman in 2001 and hired his own IT staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Leahy techies neglected to put up a firewall between the GOP and Democratic staff, making it possible for all staffers to read everything posted on the shared drive. No one hacked into anyone's private files. These are, in effect, Leahy leaks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why is the hapless staffer being hounded? And why is no one reporting the much bigger story of the memos?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Kirkpatrick is the Journal's associate editorial page editor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Partisan Wrangles"" -- WSJ Dec. 9, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: A Violation of Trust by Judiciary Panel Staffers"" -- WSJ Dec. 15, 2003)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor:A Violation of Clear Thinking by the Senator"" -- WSJ Dec. 18, 2003)</p></div>"			3					6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408439658.xml.txt	"<div><p>Black Leaders of the Future</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's probably bad form to point it out -- it sounds like something some right-wing opponent of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> would say -- but there's some good news on the racial front.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed I've just been talking to one of the principal authors of a report with the virtually subversive title: ""Two Decades of Progress: African Americans Moving Forward in Higher Education.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I overstate the case, of course. We all know that, despite too many setbacks, black Americans are plowing ahead. But, to some degree for reasons that may be part psychological and part tactical, blacks have hesitated to point it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael T. Nettles points it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, says the University of Michigan professor of education, an estimated 89,000 African Americans will be getting baccalaureate degrees this year, continuing a trend that saw an increase of more than 50 percent in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. ""Since 1985, when we were just 8.8 percent of all undergraduates, we've been increasing our presence to the point where we are now over 11 percent,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, he noted, the increases have come in virtually every higher-education sector: in the most highly selective private institutions (up by 57 percent in the 20-year period), in predominately white public universities (up 48 percent), in historically black schools (up 14 percent) and in every region of the country -- with the South leading the pack.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nettles, who is executive director of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute, which prepared the report for the United Negro College Fund, said he's not trying to be unduly rosy-eyed -- merely realistic about the trends his research disclosed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The report just puts a much-needed positive light on what African Americans have accomplished,"" he said in a telephone interview from Ann Arbor. ""We've still got work to do, no question about it. We're not where we should be in enrollment (blacks are just over 11 percent of the nation's college enrollees but about 14.5 percent of the college-age cohort), in graduation rates (45 percent after five years vs. 57 percent for whites) or in faculty (less than 5 percent of the nation's faculty). In addition, while we're graduating 89,000 baccalaureates, we have only about 1,600 PhDs -- out of 44,000 in the country -- and that's where you get faculty.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nettles is concerned, too, that black freshmen lag their white counterparts by nearly a full letter grade in grade-point average. ""That needs to be improved,"" he says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so does the status of young black males.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Nettles, 63 percent of all African American undergraduates are women, while the rates for other groups are much nearer equal: about 53 percent women for whites, slightly more than 50 percent male for Asian Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The story for African American men who make it to college is not a negative story,"" Nettles insists. ""About 37 percent of the entering African American freshmen are males -- and about 37 percent of those earning baccalaureates are male.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The male-female disparity in college-going rates, though, continues a long-term trend that Nettles can't quite explain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, last year's United Negro College Fund report disclosed that the number of black women earning bachelor's degrees had increased by some 55 percent since the mid-1970s, but by only 20 percent for black men.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We think a part of the explanation may have to do with greater other-than-college opportunities for black men,"" he said. ""The jobs available for boys after high school look better than the jobs available to girls."" He mentioned military service (black men are 19 percent of new enlistees) and construction work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I suspect something else is going on. I look at public high schools -- particularly in the urban centers -- and see an already noticeable male-female gap. Indeed, you can see the beginnings of the trend in junior high classrooms. I think we're losing the boys long before it comes time for college applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still I have to agree with Nettles's positive spin -- and for two reasons. The first is that the enrollment and graduation trends furnish a solid base on which to build future progress. The second, which applies not just to college but to every aspect in black life, is that if you don't know where your successes are, you don't know where to make the next push.</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398730713.xml.txt	"<div><p>On Media Bias, Network Stars Are Rather Clueless</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dan Rather has been on television more than usual lately, popping up all over the place promoting his book about American success stories and along the way wearily denying that he's the left-wing devil some conservatives think he is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same old story as far as Dan is concerned. The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official. There is none. It's all a figment of the reactionary imagination. Case closed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, as just about everyone who lives between Manhattan and Malibu knows, there is a leftward tilt on the big-three evening newscasts. A poll last year by Brill's Content showed that 74% of Republicans spotted a liberal bias. No bulletin there. But 47% of Democrats agreed, believing that ""most journalists are more liberal than they are.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how can three otherwise intelligent, worldly men be so delusional when it comes to their own business? One possibility, of course, is that they're not delusional at all. They know they're slanting the news and they're simply doing what a lot of people do when caught red-handed. They're denying it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not it, as far as I can figure. I'd bet that if you hooked Dan and Tom and Peter up to a lie detector and asked them if there's a liberal bias on their newscasts, they'd all say ""no"" and they'd all pass the test.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves one other possibility. Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, ""What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong."" Dan thought it was because some people ""subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . . [a] negative sign on you.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Mr. Rather and the other evening stars think that liberal bias means just one thing: going hard on Republicans and easy on Democrats. But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. ""What do you consider the New York Times?"" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. ""Middle of the road,"" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about ""right wing"" Republicans and ""right wing"" Christians and ""right wing"" Miami Cubans and ""right wing"" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words ""left wing"" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news. Why is it that the media elites aren't nearly as cozy with with the anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or pro-life lobbies?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media elites can float through their personal lives and rarely run into someone with an opposing view. This is very unhealthy and sometimes downright ridiculous, as when Pauline Kael, for years the brilliant film critic at The New Yorker, was completely baffled about how Richard Nixon could have beaten George McGovern in 1972: ""Nobody I know voted for Nixon."" Never mind that Nixon carried 49 states. She wasn't kidding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is one group that is uniquely unqualified to comment on liberal bias it's the big-time media stars. So Dan and Tom and Peter: Stop telling us that we're the problem, and start thinking about what liberal bias really means.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Goldberg was a correspondent for CBS News from 1972 until 2000.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Reporters Need Course In Basic Capitalism"" -- WSJ June 5, 2001)</p></div>"	2								2

Move to Hawaii</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The “aloha spirit” may hold a deep lesson for all of us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HONOLULU — Kristin Pauker still remembers her uncle’s warning about Dartmouth. “It’s a white institution,” he said. “You’re going to feel out of place.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker, who is now a psychology professor, is of mixed ancestry, her mother of Japanese descent and her father white from an Italian-Irish background. Applying to colleges, she was keen to leave Hawaii for the East Coast, eager to see something new and different. But almost immediately after she arrived on campus in 1998, she understood what her uncle had meant.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She encountered a barrage of questions from fellow students. What was her ethnicity? Where was she from? Was she Native Hawaiian? The questions seemed innocent on the surface, but she sensed that the students were really asking what box to put her in. And that categorization would determine how they treated her. “It opened my eyes to the fact that not everyone sees race the same way,” she told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in Hawaii, being mixed was so common as to be nearly unremarkable. Many of her friends were some mixture of East Asian ethnicities, white, Filipino, Hawaiian and more, and for the most part, everyone hung out with everyone else. The Dartmouth student body, on the other hand, seemed self-segregated. The nonwhite students primarily stuck with their own race — blacks sat with blacks in the cafeteria, Asians with Asians, Native Americans with Native Americans. (Dartmouth, which was around 75 percent white then, has since doubled its share of nonwhite students.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the first time in her life, she wasn’t sure where she belonged, and she found herself wondering: Does it have to be like this?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few years later, as a graduate student in psychology at Tufts, she began her first study probing that question. Psychologists argue that “essentialist” thinking — ideas about human beings’ unchangeable essence, their inherent inferiority or the threat they supposedly pose — makes racism possible. Dr. Pauker wanted to know when children started expressing essentialist views of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She found that between ages 4 and 11, upper-middle-class children from mostly white neighborhoods around Boston increasingly viewed race as a permanent condition and expressed stereotypes about other racial groups: that blacks were aggressive or, on the flip side, good at basketball; that Asians were submissive and good at math. These children came from public schools in liberal areas. They probably weren’t deliberately taught these stereotypes at home. But they absorbed them from the American ether nonetheless.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would children in Hawaii express the same views? Dr. Pauker repeated the study with middle- and upper-middle-class grade-school students in and around Honolulu, and was not entirely surprised to find that in Hawaii, the children, including those who were white, tended not to express the same essentialist ideas about race. They were not race-blind. They recognized skin color, hair texture and other features commonly associated with race. But they did not attribute to race the inherent qualities — aggression or book smarts — that their mainland brethren did. “They didn’t believe that race was biological,” Dr. Pauker told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She had a hypothesis to explain the difference. Whites dominated in the Boston area schools, but were a minority in Hawaii, and always had been. Hawaii also had the highest percentage of mixed-race people by a long shot in the country. (Among them was our first mixed-race president, Barack Obama, who was born there.) Mixed-race people, who make up nearly a quarter of Hawaii’s population of 1.4 million, serve as a kind of jamming mechanism for people’s race radar, Dr. Pauker thinks. Because if you can’t tell what people are by looking at them — if their very existence blurs the imagined boundaries between supposedly separate groups — then race becomes a less useful way to think about people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I’m interested in all of this partly because I myself come from a mixed background. I have an Ashkenazi Jewish father and a Puerto Rican mother (neither of which, I should point out, is a race). I first came across Dr. Pauker some years ago while researching mixed-race identity formation. The question of how people from mixed backgrounds create their identity has, until recently, mostly been ignored by psychologists. The assumption has been that mixed-race people likely have a difficult time because they’re from (at least) two cultures but inhabit a world that often requires total allegiance to one group or another. And there’s some truth to this. Researchers have documented how the unique challenges encountered by mixed people can, depending on the social context, negatively affect their mental health.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Dr. Pauker belongs to a small group of psychologists, many of them mixed themselves, who have begun to explore the advantages of being multiracial. For instance, Sarah Gaither at Duke, a frequent collaborator of Dr. Pauker’s, has discovered that, when reminded of their multiracial heritage, mixed-race individuals score higher on tests that measure creativity. This is probably not because they are inherently superior in some way, but because the very thing that’s so difficult for them — the need to navigate multiple worlds — may actually enhance mental flexibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Plenty of research indicates that diversity has many benefits. Diverse groups are better at problem-solving; in mock trials, diverse juries give fairer verdicts; diverse companies are more profitable; researchers argue that diverse countries have stronger economies. And the United States is not only becoming more diverse, it’s also growing more mixed. Mixed-race people are among the fastest-growing segments of the population — between 2.6 percent and 6.9 percent of the population, depending on the study. By 2060, the segment is projected to double.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, at the same time, we seem to be in the throes of a backlash against diversity, against mixing, with many people trying to claw their way back to a largely mythical, more homogeneous past. Could Hawaii show us another way forward? I flew there to find out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One day, I sat down under an enormous tree on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and tried to count the people I saw walking with companions of different racial backgrounds. One of Dr. Pauker’s arguments about what makes Hawaii special is that people have numerous cross-group acquaintances. Forty percent end up marrying someone from outside their own group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campus was clearly diverse, but I quickly realized the assumption underlying my fieldwork was fatally flawed. Here I was trying to discern ancestry, but how was I to know anyone’s background just by looking, particularly in a place where people were so mixed?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My gaffe got me musing about the many assumptions we inherit about race without really thinking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the more pernicious myths to take root in the modern mind is that racism is human nature, that it’s an inevitable part of who we are, a product of our evolution. You’ve probably heard the argument. We’re group animals. We instinctually divide the world into “us” and “them.” Groups compete with one another. They invariably enter into conflict. Even chimpanzee “tribes” wage war with one another, after all. We’re thus doomed to look down on people we’re not familiar with — to “otherize,” in modern academic jargon, those who don’t look or speak like us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, this is only part of the story. In the 1960s, the social psychologist Marilynn Brewer tested the idea that human cultures naturally divided the world into in-groups and out-groups, and that they instinctually despised people who were unfamiliar. She and her colleagues conducted interviews with people in 19 non-Western cultures. Yes, some were hostile to other groups. But many actually respected and admired them. Their attitude was, to quote one respondent, “We have our ways and they have their ways.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“The assumption that groups are competitive, that out-group hate is a correlate of in-group love, that it’s built on our evolution as a social species — it’s just not true,” Dr. Brewer told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of race as an essential aspect of one’s personhood didn’t always dominate, even in the West. Some ancient Greeks ascribed human differences in skin tone and hair texture to climate, an idea that’s similar to the modern scientific understanding of the variation that underlies what we call race. That doesn’t mean that the Greeks saw all humans as equal. They had plenty of slaves. Women were second-class citizens. And they divided the world into Greek, or civilized, and barbarian. Being civilized was clearly superior. But being barbarian wasn’t an inescapable condition, the way many would come to think of race in the United States.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Centuries later, the Romans had a similar view, dividing people not by skin color, but by whether they were Romanized or non-Romanized. Again, these differences were not seen as inherent. The Romanized Gauls used to be like the non-Romanized Germans, Julius Caesar observed during his military campaigns in Western and Central Europe. People could change. A Celt or Egyptian who moved to Rome would, you’d expect, become just as Roman as the next guy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When did this more flexible understanding of race begin to harden? Some historians point to the 14th century as a turning point. Until then, Jews in Europe had some legal rights. But in 1348, the plague struck. Many believed that the Jews were responsible; they began to move away from the view that Jews were people who merely had a different religion and toward the idea that they were inherently corrupt and dangerous.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came the African slave trade of the 16th century. In earlier times, slaves often came from Eastern Europe. (The word “slave” is related to “Slav.”) But with the discovery of the Americas and the surge in demand for labor, slavers set their sights on sub-Saharan Africa. They justified this plundering of humanity with arguments about the supposed inferiority and bestiality of Africans. In the United States, these ideas would evolve into a sadistic paternalism — that slavery was actually good for Africans because they were incapable of self-governance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These ideas — and probably all racist ideas — served a clear purpose: to buttress an economic system that depended on free labor. As Ibram X. Kendi pointed out in his book “Stamped From the Beginning,” hate does not necessarily precede racism. Instead, societies often spin racist ideas out of self-interest — to further political or economic goals — and these ideas then lead to hate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even with the major effort that went into promoting the racial hierarchy, in the early Colonial period, poor whites frequently mingled and found common cause with African-Americans. Late-17th-century Colonial Virginia had a thriving multiracial population. Long before Karl Marx’s class-based critique of capitalism, poor whites and blacks joined forces in several rebellions. The most famous was Bacon’s Rebellion in 1676, in which indentured white servants and free and enslaved blacks took up arms against Virginia’s governor but were crushed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This revolt shook the elites, who worked even harder to enforce the color lines. A series of laws meant to prevent interracial mingling (and to clearly define blacks as property, not citizens) went into effect. A white person in Virginia could be banished from the colony for having a child with a black or biracial person. White men might be whipped.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason given for these laws was some version of wanting to prevent the “abominable mixture” of the races. But the true purpose was to keep the structures of race intact in the American mind so that the economy, which depended on stolen labor, could continue whirring along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us back to Hawaii. Dr. Pauker runs the Intergroup Social Perception Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Maybe her most intriguing finding is that Hawaii can rub off on visitors, changing how they think about race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some years ago, she began following 143 white college students from the mainland who’d come to Hawaii to study. Over time, she discovered, many of them lost the essentialist ideas that characterized their thinking about race when they’d just arrived. Dr. Pauker gauged this shift with a widely used questionnaire called the “Race Conception Scale.” It asks subjects to assess, on a seven-point scale, statements like “racial groups are primarily determined by biology” and “a person’s race is fixed at birth.” The mainland students began to think about race more like students in Hawaii did — as a fluid concept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many reasons for this transformation, she thinks. White mainland students often find themselves in the minority for the first time in their lives. And it’s not always easy. Just as students of color often drop out at a higher rate than whites from universities on the mainland, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, it’s white students who drop out at higher rates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The statistic hints at what the white mainland students are going through. They are escaping, probably for the first time, what sociologists call “white transparency.” Whiteness stops being invisible to them; they suddenly perceive themselves as having a color — a race. And if they’re going to have friends, they’re forced to socialize with nonwhites, which means pushing past their preconceptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is likely humbling and occasionally painful. But pain can mean growth. “It’s sort of like when you go and exercise,” Dr. Pauker told me. “Unless you tire your muscles out and experience some pain and discomfort, you’re not going to get any benefit.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most remarkably, as these students’ ideas about race relax, Dr. Pauker finds that they score higher on other tests of cognitive flexibility. They become more creative problem-solvers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Dr. Pauker and I discussed this over a poke bowl — a Hawaiian dish with East Asian influences that has become popular on the mainland, too — it brought to mind something James Baldwin said decades ago: Racism exacts a toll on those who are racist, distorting their humanity and hindering their ability to be fully self-reflective beings. That’s surely no consolation to the victims of racism, but Dr. Pauker’s findings seem to confirm Baldwin’s thesis. The mental rigidity required to harbor racist ideas ends up bleeding over into other cognitive domains.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“In lots of circumstances, rigidity is helpful,” Dr. Pauker told me, because it conserves mental energy. In theory, racial categorizing is supposed to work like a shorthand, helping us determine how to interact with people while expending minimal energy figuring out who they actually are. The problem, though, is that our perception of race and what it means is based on a model of the world that’s almost always incorrect, and often entirely fabricated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker’s studies have important caveats. White students who have come here from the mainland are, almost by definition, already an open-minded, adventurous bunch. Maybe it’s not so surprising that for them, spending time in a nonmajority-white place would change how they think about race. The real trick would be to get a white supremacist to enroll here and see if there was the same transformation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Hawaii the harmonious melting pot is also a cliché in its own right. Even in the early 20th century, mainland sociologists observing Hawaii marveled at how its different groups seemed to get along so well. They pointed to the archipelago, then a United States territory, as a vision of the future of civilization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“We seem to be brought, so to speak, into the very presence of the historical process, where we may observe civilization as it evolves under something like laboratory conditions,” wrote the University of Chicago sociologist Robert Park in 1937 about Hawaii. In 1925, the sociologist Romanzo Adams put it this way: “There is abundant evidence that the peoples of Hawaii are in process of becoming one people.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The interracial harmony that supposedly reigned was cited by other mainlanders to make more self-serving arguments. During World War II, the fact that people of Japanese descent, then the largest ethnic group on the islands, were loyal Americans was held up as evidence that the United States was not, as Japanese propaganda claimed, engaged in a racial war with Japan. During the Cold War, as communism spread in Asia, Americans pointed to Hawaii as evidence that Asians and other nonwhites could be well integrated into American society. And during the civil rights era, Hawaii was held up as a place where nonwhite people were happy with their lot. Why couldn’t African-Americans be more like them? (In fact, partly inspired by the civil rights movement of the mainland, Native Hawaiians led a Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Hawaiian academics are understandably sick of their state being seen by outsiders as a model of racial harmony. They view it as a fantasy that papers over very real inequities. “We shouldn’t glorify ourselves,” Jonathan Y. Okamura, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told me. “We need to work on the ways in which we continue to foster unequal opportunities for groups here.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prejudice against Micronesians, a recent immigrant group, is openly expressed, for example. People say things about them — calling them cockroaches and pushing for their genocide — “that would not fly anywhere else in this day and age,” Sha Merirei Ongelungel, an artist and activist of Palauan descent, told me. Disgusted by this behavior, she created the Twitter hashtag #BeingMicronesian for people to share their experiences of prejudice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Being African-American isn’t easy in Hawaii, either, said Akiemi Glenn, executive director of the Popolo Project in Honolulu. Stereotypes about African-Americans abound, she told me, in part because so few black people live on the islands to push back against them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, Ms. Glenn, whose family is from North Carolina, said that there is a complexity here that’s lacking on the mainland. Ms. Glenn has Chinese, Native American, African and European ancestors. Back in North Carolina, she’s just black. There’s no room to claim her Chinese ancestry. But in Hawaii it often becomes a way to find common ground with others. “There are spaces for people to acknowledge their diverse genealogy,” Ms. Glenn told me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How did this space open up in Hawaii? Historians I asked pointed with reverence to one thing: the union organizing that occurred here in the postwar period.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the late 19th century, Hawaii was a constitutional monarchy, ruled by a  Hawaiian monarch. That ended in 1893 when a group of mostly white plantation owners, descended from an earlier wave of missionaries, overthrew the Hawaiian queen and declared, perversely, a republic. Their goal was annexation by the United States, which occurred in 1898, and access to its markets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, plantation owners imported workers from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and as far away as Portugal. They believed that, divided by different languages and cultures, the workers would be less likely to conspire together and cause trouble. Ethnic and racial stereotyping was widespread. The Chinese “coolies” were cast as depraved gamblers; the Filipinos as prone to violence; the Japanese as cliquish and loyal only to the ascendant Japanese empire. The Portuguese, who tended to have higher-ranking jobs than everyone else, were a lesser form of white — better than the “Asiatics” they managed, but not quite good enough to join the Anglo-Saxon elite. Native Hawaiians, meanwhile, were seen as good-natured but lazy, and in need of white paternalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after World War II, in the space of a few years, this social order rapidly changed. The San Francisco-based International Longshore and Warehouse Union began organizing plantation, dock and other workers in Hawaii, who often labored in wretched conditions. Success would require interracial unity, union organizers quickly realized. The workers needed to overcome the ethnic divisions of plantation society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, sociologist Moon-Kie Jung describes what followed as “proto <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.” To build a union everyone would buy into, all ethnic groups had to be equally represented. And so union leadership positions were deliberately parceled out among ethnic groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not everyone in Hawaii was a longshoreman or plantation worker, of course. Yet that epoch of deliberate restructuring of the working class, Professor Okamura and others say, had a long-lasting effect on Hawaiian society. The effort succeeded in getting better working conditions from the “big five” sugar and fruit companies that ruled the economy. Organized labor became a political force, helping to usher the Democratic Party into power in 1954. The party, which has largely dominated the state ever since, passed a series of progressive laws leading to investment in public education and a higher minimum wage, and the state in 1974 became the first to mandate employer-provided health insurance. (The progressive tradition continues today: An early challenge to President Trump’s Muslim travel ban came from Hawaii.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We might call this the Marxist reading on what went right in Hawaii. Working-class Hawaiians realized that race was being used to divide them — keeping them from improving their lot. Dr. Brewer, the social psychologist, described this transformation as labor successfully creating a new “super ordinate” identity that cut across racial lines. That new identity did not totally erase old divisions, but it superseded them, at least for a while. (It probably also helped that Hawaii never had any laws against miscegenation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent decades, the legacy of labor organizing has begun to fray, says Professor Okamura. Hawaii now has a high proportion of students in private school. Its public schools have become more racially and ethnically segregated, preventing the intergroup relationships that he thinks were so important in the past. But he says the history of organized labor in Hawaii suggests that you can, by deliberately dismantling racial barriers and fostering opportunity for everyone, change race relations in society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One other holdover from Hawaii’s plantation past, when laborers of different backgrounds worked closely together, is a tradition of ethnic joke-telling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is not a politically correct society where everyone is “woke.” On the contrary, ethnic jokes are so common it can be jarring for people who aren’t from Hawaii. (Here’s one from the well-known Hawaiian-born comedian Frank De Lima, who himself has Portuguese ancestry: “Why did the Portagee water half of his lawn? He heard there was a 50 percent chance of rain.”)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker’s lab hasn’t formally studied this — and there is academic debate about how benign these ethnic jokes really are — but she thinks that the tradition may do some good.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberal parents often claim they’re blind to race, that they don’t see it. But Dr. Pauker has found that, on the mainland, this may paradoxically allow stereotypes to creep into children’s understanding of race. If you don’t actively shape how children think about race, they may be more likely to absorb hurtful and damaging clichés from the social ether.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Partly because of racial joking, race is always on the mind here. When people think about race consciously, she posits, it helps prevent essentialist thinking from taking root unconsciously. Joking about ethnic stereotypes, especially about one’s own group, at least keeps conversations about race in Hawaii on the surface, rather than pushing them underground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People are frank about other aspects of race as well in Hawaii. When she grew up, she recalls, people often referred to her as “that hapa girl” (‘hapa” means “half” in Hawaiian pidgin), and she didn’t think twice about it. Maybe that’s because so many others were also hapa. Or perhaps that nonchalance is because this racial ribbing didn’t occur against a background of any clear majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An intriguing finding from Dr. Pauker’s lab is that kids in Hawaii are terrible at defining other people’s race compared with kids on the mainland. That’s not because they don’t see the features usually associated with race. It’s because, when shown photos, they complicate their answers. Whereas a kid on the mainland might simply say “Asian,” in Hawaii, kids tend to say something like, “Japanese, Chinese, Filipino and Norwegian.” Instead of labeling a face “white” and leaving it at that, they might offer “Scottish, Irish, German and Italian.” They are like fine wine connoisseurs while everyone else drinks cheap beer. From an early age, they see race as something complex and full of nuance, not something simple or black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if Dr. Pauker and her colleagues are right that increased diversity and mixing help quash racism, why is the mainland now experiencing what feels like a resurgence of tribalism?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dr. Pauker’s answer is that while, yes, the United States has become more diverse, Americans have also become more ideologically segregated from one another, making the kinds of meaningful interactions that erode racial thinking less likely. Part of that segregation comes from the news we watch, which has become more Balkanized. Part of it is the echo chamber of social media, which reflects back our own views. But another big reason may be the apparent absence of a larger umbrella identity — an American identity — that can supersede and contain tribal identities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, Hawaii has that, too — an identity that, despite the efforts to prevent its emergence, coalesced among plantation workers. It’s exemplified in the “aloha spirit,” a concept roughly defined as an emphasis on mutual respect, getting along and taking care of one another, and in Hawaiian pidgin, the language people from many different backgrounds working on the plantation created to communicate. This identity is simply called “local.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But are any of these lessons really applicable on the mainland, or anywhere else?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hawaii is unique historically, demographically and perhaps most crucially, geographically. Justin Gest, a political scientist at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government who studies the evolution of island societies, told me that islands, separated as they are from currents on the mainland, are often unique laboratories of human culture, caldrons where ingredients from different cultures recombine into something new. Living on a small, circumscribed piece of land marooned in the sea, Dr. Pauker points out, forces you to interact with your neighbors in ways that may not occur on continents. And when destructive forces threaten to tear society apart, those relationships matter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider what happened with the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Worried about espionage and worse, the government rounded up and interned about 120,000 Japanese-Americans on the mainland. Hawaii arrested far fewer, about 1,800 — and that was despite the fact that some 150,000 people of Japanese ancestry then lived on the islands, and that Japanese planes had just bombed Pearl Harbor. What was different?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The officials in charge in Hawaii had deep connections with the local Japanese community. Robert Shivers, who headed Honolulu’s F.B.I. office, and who had been dispatched from the mainland precisely to surveil the Japanese in the lead-up to World War II, had a young Japanese student living in his house, whom he would refer to as his adopted daughter. John Burns, the head of the Honolulu Police Department’s Espionage Bureau, who grew up in Hawaii and would become the state’s second governor, also had deep ties in the Japanese community. Both resisted calls from Washington to intern the Japanese, a story told by the journalist Tom Coffman in his book “The Island Edge of America.” They also belonged to a multiethnic group called the Council for Interracial Unity, which had convened precisely to prevent the implosion of Hawaiian society in the event of war with Japan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This brings me back to the “aloha spirit,” which may hold a deeper lesson for all of us. This tradition, several people told me, came from Native Hawaiian culture. Professor Okamura, who otherwise pooh-poohed the idea of Hawaiian racial harmony, related how Native Hawaiians offered his great-grandmother food when she first arrived from Japan. Mr. Burns, who was governor from 1962 to 1974, recalled Hawaiians inviting him to eat as he wandered the beach as a boy. The mother of Daniel Inouye, the senator from Hawaii, was adopted and raised by a Native Hawaiian family — something she often reminded him of.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Separately, these are all just heartwarming anecdotes. But together they suggest that even as Hawaii was subject to the divisive forces roiling the world, a different set of local customs coursing beneath the surface served as a type of counterbalance. Where did they come from?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Capt. James Cook first arrived in Hawaii in 1778, between 200,000 and 800,000 people lived in the archipelago. (Huge swaths of the population later succumbed to diseases the Westerners brought with them.) Polynesians may have first come to the islands as early as 1,700 years ago. Over the centuries, they developed elaborate methods of agricultural and resource management. They irrigated fields of taro, sugar cane, sweet potato and coconut trees with intricate ditches. Along the shore, they built fish ponds. They prohibited fishing in the ocean during certain seasons, an ancient form of sustainable fishery management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, crucially, the Hawaiians traded and shared among themselves — because to survive, they had to. People from the uplands exchanged sweet potato for fish with people from the coasts. A cultural norm of hospitality emerged. The islands weren’t a utopia, of course. They experienced wars and occasional famines, and even had a kind of untouchable caste. But a premium was placed on getting along — the “aloha spirit.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>“I don’t want to sound like a tourist commercial,” Davianna Pomaikai McGregor, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said as she explained this to me. “But I think the Native Hawaiian people and the practice of aloha set the framework” for race relations on the islands.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason it sounds like a TV jingle is that it has become one: “Aloha” is a marketing gimmick for the state’s primary industry, tourism. A cartoonish version blares at visitors the moment they get off the plane, often in the form of dancers in grass skirts. Everyone I spoke to with Native ancestry found this irritating and sometimes insulting. One, a university student, told me that she felt like “aloha” was used to make Native Hawaiians invisible in their own land. So it’s important to understand what’s missing from the tourist version. “You’re supposed to give back, not just take take take,” Mahesh Cleveland, a Hawaiian-born lawyer with Native ancestry, told me. “There is an expectation of reciprocity.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an explanation about why race relations are different in Hawaii, the “aloha spirit” is actually quite profound. It suggests that attitudes about other people stem, in part, from our understanding of the ecological limits of the world we inhabit. If you think that the resources of the world are limitless and that you don’t really need other people to survive — that they’re disposable because the bounty is endless — you may be inclined to treat people as things. But if you’re aware of how much you depend on others and how small and fragile the world is, you’re likely to have a very different approach to human relationships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Traditions of hospitality toward the stranger exist in many cultures. They’re central to Christianity, for instance.

These essays, accumulated from 1946 to 1961, offer a vivid, stimulating challenge to that ""age of conformity."" If variety is a charm of essay collections, their bane can be a random unevenness -- here overcome by a furiously cool, contrarian intelligence, which unifies this assortment of pieces about politics, literature, sex, theater and fashion. Questioning with aphoristic zingers the Kinsey Reports' mechanistic approach to the female orgasm, the journalistic pieties of John Hersey's ""Hiroshima,"" the upwardly mobile aspirations of women's fashion magazines, the genius of Tennessee Williams, the anti-American tourist reports of Simone de Beauvoir, the outrages of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Mary McCarthy spares neither the right nor the left -- nor herself. In ""My Confession,"" she describes how, starting out from the wrong motives -- ignorance, shallowness, vanity, social snobbery -- she arrived at a coherent liberal anticommunist position. ""I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late for me to become a Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned young men I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to take up young, like ballet dancing.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Essays of Leonard Michaels</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. A master of the short story, whose tales conveyed high anxiety, urban violence and exuberant intellectual analysis, Leonard Michaels was also an extraordinarily fine essayist. This collection, assembled posthumously by his widow, is divided between critical and autobiographical essays, though everything Michaels wrote was deeply personal. Whether seeing as a boy the movie ""Gilda,"" where the heroine marries a sadist played by George Macready (""I didn't want Macready to unzipper Rita Hayworth's dress""), or his father offering him some money before his date (""He gave. I took.""), Michaels gets to feelings of vulnerability and shame with astonishing speed. Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by Jewish immigrant parents, speaking only Yiddish until he was 5, he perfected a terse English sentence that carries traces of Yiddish's ironic, singsong, questioning shrug. ""Paradox as a cognitive mode is everywhere in Yiddish. It's probably in the genes and may explain the Jewish love of jokes."" His humor is both hilarious and dark, issuing from an evolved persona that had elements of the street-savvy hipster, academic and Talmudist. Above all, he was a storyteller -- proof positive that good essays are at bottom stories about the mind at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speak, Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Vladimir Nabokov (1951)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. A series of linked autobiographical essays by one of the masters of modern prose, this marvel of a memoir begins with the rather dire sentiment: ""The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our true existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness."" That crack of light becomes suffused with sunshine, as Vladimir Nabokov recollects his enchanted boyhood, the pampered son of aristocratic parents, surrounded by 50 servants in their St. Petersburg townhouse and country estate. In dreamy, nostalgic, prismatic sentences colored with sensuous detail, the author conjures up a way of life soon to become extinct, erased by the Bolsheviks' takeover. Nabokov takes the narrative further into his darker years of exile, loss, poverty and literary apprenticeship, meanwhile conversing with his tender ghosts. There is a loving portrait of his liberal, witty jurist father, who passed on to Vladimir a butterfly-hunting obsession, as well as his mother, relatives and tutors. But the gem of the collection is a portrait of his portly Swiss-French governess, Mademoiselle, who specialized in feeling proud and miserable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hunger of Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Richard Rodriguez (1982)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Subtitled ""The Education of Richard Rodriguez,"" this brilliant debut announced an author who would go on to write captivating essays for decades to come. Ignoring an editor's advice that he write ""in stories -- not a series of essays. Let's have more Grandma,"" Mr. Rodriguez chose the essay form because it allowed him to pursue a political argument via his personal experience. At the time, his opposition to bilingual education and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> raised hackles, yet so effectively was he able to portray the distance between the intimate Spanish of his home and the public English of his schooling that his position made perfect sense, at least to himself. ""I remember what was so grievously lost to define what was necessarily gained."" The son of working-class parents who spoke broken English, he excelled at schoolwork and became a ""scholarship boy"" whose immersion in a cultivated, moneyed world drew him unavoidably if guiltily away from his loving family. Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates, with alarming frankness and elegant prose, a singular perspective, deeply moral, fusing sardonic detachment and affective longing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Sign of Saturn</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Susan Sontag (1980)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. After her first two essay books, ""Against Interpretation"" and ""Styles of Radical Will,"" established Susan Sontag as our exigent queen of cultural criticism, she allowed herself to relax some of that cerebral severity, bringing a more generous warmth to her third collection. She began ""Under the Sign of Saturn"" with a touching tribute to a writer she greatly admired: ""The grief I feel at Paul Goodman's death is sharper because we were not friends, though we co-inhabited several of the same worlds. . . . I disliked him -- the reason being, as I often explained plaintively during his lifetime, that I felt he didn't like me."" This honest piece was followed by the magnificent title essay, a deeply insightful portrait of Walter Benjamin, the brainy, depressive writer with whom Sontag felt a kinship, as well as superb appreciations of Antonin Artaud, Elias Canetti and Sontag's friend and mentor, Roland Barthes. The collection also features Sontag's celebrated takedown of Leni Riefenstahl, ""Fascinating Fascism,"" but for the most part Sontag gives herself over here to her love of various heroes of the life of the mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Phillip Lopate</p></div>"			3					6

They're always excited on the way out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley replaced him Thursday with Cortez Trotter, a black man.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter spent his career on the paramedic side of the department, not the firefighting side. So history is being made on two fronts, not just the obvious one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, Trotter is the first black man to run an overwhelmingly white department, where some firefighters won't like him because his skin is darker than theirs. They might be some of the same idiots who've gone on fire radios recently, anonymously yelling racial slurs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what about the other historical front?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oddly, the new fire commissioner might not be held responsible for fighting fires and probably won't ever take command of a major fire.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a paramedic and bureaucrat, he has never spent much time directing firefighters in front of burning buildings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the mayor insisted that his decision had nothing to do with politics or symbolism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""No, no no,"" Daley said. ""It's not a symbol. He's qualified. He's very proud. He's African-American. . . . But he's qualified.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To prove that racial politics have nothing to do with his promotion, Trotter served notice that diversity is the most important issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In order for every community to feel confident in the Fire Department and EMS [ambulance] service they receive, our department must reconcile our operational issues,"" Trotter said sternly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""But more importantly, we must address our human relations and diversity problems.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also warned white firefighters who might have a problem with a black boss. He said he wouldn't tolerate any shenanigans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Let me serve notice to those who wrongfully believe that the department is a haven for small-mindedness, offensive behavior and stagnation,"" Trotter said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We are entering a new era for the Chicago Fire Department. Please recognize that for what it is, or be prepared to face the consequences of your actions.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For too long, the Chicago Fire Department has been a club for white guys, with the top jobs handed from grandfather to father to son.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't work anymore in a city that is mostly black and Latino.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It especially doesn't work when the city is run by a white mayor- for-life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But make no mistake, this appointment is about covering Daley's flank, not the Fire Department's flank.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though Daley controls minority politicians, he's got a problem coming.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This summer, Daley's friends, the Outfit-connected Duffs, will go on trial in federal court. A grand jury has charged that they fraudulently received $100 million in <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> contracts, though they were white guys.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In effect, they stole $100 million from black, Latino and female- owned firms. And I don't know how anyone can believe that $100 million in deals leaves City Hall without Daley's OK.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So having Trotter and other minorities out front in high profile positions, getting TV time, can't hurt the mayor. It can only help.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter, executive director of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, faces other political challenges too. The vast majority of 911 calls don't involve fires; they involve ambulance requests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This move reflects the changes in the department,"" said a paramedic commander who happens to be white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""This is not about black and white, it's about paramedics and firefighters, and it's about time that our side of the department got some clout,"" he said. ""Trotter will give us that.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fire commissioner's job is political and administrative, yes. But it is also about fighting fires and saving lives, not only of fire victims, but also the lives of firefighters under his command.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daley has made the political decision that extensive fire command experience isn't necessary for the top fire job. If you've got questions on that front, take it up with him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tragic and needless deaths at the 69 W. Washington St. fire may be attributed to a lack of command experience by some fire bosses at the scene. If Trotter had been commissioner then and it was found he had little if any fire command experience, he'd be the one forced to resign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a paramedic, Trotter will have to earn the respect of firefighters. As a black man, he has decided to push affirmative- action policies while dealing with a union opposed to racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trotter will need all his political skills to succeed. He's been given a terribly tough job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's all about fire, the political kind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>"			3					6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/215497350.xml.txt	"<div><p>For the sake of argument</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a great minder of Senate traditions and a stirring elected intellectual, perhaps Washington's last.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he sponsored no major legislation, was not the prophet he thinks he was - and never learned the difference between being right and being effective. By Jacob Weisberg</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a steamy Wednesday in August, Pat Moynihan rode with his family up Pennsylvania Avenue, a street he helped to resurrect, to the White House, a building where he once worked, to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award that 37 years ago he assisted in creating. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who hopes to inherit his seat in the Senate, began the ceremony in the East Room. Bill Clinton, whose departure from office will conclude eight years of strife with Moynihan, presented the award. On most of the 15 recipients, the president bestowed kisses and bear-hugs. But as Moynihan bowed his head to receive his medal, Clinton simply clasped his hand and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Moynihan looked a bit abstracted as Clinton fitted the ribbon around his neck, it might have been because the room was, for him, full of ghosts: the four presidents he served (Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford) and the four he mostly fought from the Senate (Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton). Half the other honorees were people the 73-year-old senator has been enmeshed with at one point or another in his career: Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and for many years his nemesis on welfare policy; John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Moynihan's predecessors as ambassador to India,. his colleague on the Harvard faculty and his neighbor in Cambridge; George McGovern, who led the Democrats in the era when Moynihan felt compelled to break with them; and the widow of Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, who was one of Moynihan's closest friends in the Senate. Another honoree, the Rev. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyn, approached Moynihan before the ceremony to apologize for his attack on Moynihan's 1965 report - once infamous and now widely praised - on the black family. At the reception afterward, Moynihan seemed to return to the present as he sipped a glass of white wine and regaled the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, and a White House speechwriter, Jeff Shesol, with the story of how the Presidential Medal came to be. John F. Kennedy, who wanted to create a system of civil honors akin to those bestowed in Britain, referred the project to his labor secretary, Arthur Goldberg. After Goldberg went to the Supreme Court, the task fell to Moynihan, who tried to pre-empt opposition to the award by pretending it had always existed. But only after Kennedy was assassinated did his idea come to fruition. Lyndon Johnson awarded the first medal posthumously to the late president along with the other recipients Kennedy had chosen (with less evident political purpose than the Clintons) - among them, E. B. White, Edward Steichen and Edmund Wilson. At the ceremony, Jacque-, line Kennedy sat behind a screen in the White House State Dining Room and wept.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You often see eyes glaze over when Moynihan starts in on one of these responsible-for-the-creation riffs, especially if the listeners have heard the story a few times before. In a capital seemingly ever consumed with the latest dust-up, where historical memory tends to be measured in days rather than decades, Moynihan's elaborations of neglected historical corridors, lost moments and failed schemes tend to be seen as exercises in irrelevance and self-regard. It isn't so much that no one in Washington takes Moynihan seriously, though his dysfunctional relationship with Clinton did consign him in recent years to a state of near irrelevancy in the Senate. It is rather that it is not easy to settle on how to take Moynihan seriously. He was, and remains, a complex and often contradictory figure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Moynihan, I think, the strains of courage, egotism, insight and petulance have always been blended together. After 24 years in the Senate, he leaves behind a record that is long on concepts and short on concrete results. Yet the Senate will be a poorer place without him. In the end, the verdict on Pat Moynihan may be that he was a frustrating conundrum: our political era's most magnificent failure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE the Medal of Freedom ceremony, I visited Moynihan in his private office in the Capitol. Others who are senior enough .to have been be-. stowed one of these coveted hideaways off the Senate floor use them as private meeting rooms or as places to catch a nap. Moynihan turned his into a writer's studio, a place to escape his staff and hammer out drafts on the 70's-vintage Smith Corona typewriter that sits on a desk in the center of the room. (An identical model graces Moynihan's office in an old one-room schoolhouse in Pindars Corners, N.Y, the upstate hamlet where he and his wife, Elizabeth, have long had a farm.) The room is filled with books and pictures, any of which will prompt a story. The most poignant is a small black-and-white photograph of Robert Kennedy that looks over Moynihan's desk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The senator himself makes an impression more professorial than official. His dress is anglophile and mildly eccentric: this afternoon, a beige suit and striped tie worn with red socks and leather-soled suede shoes. And when Moynihan, in a self-described mellow mood, begins what turns into a three-hour ramble, it is in the mannered dialect that everyone who has ever worked for him can imitate: a singsong of ""ah-ah-ahs"" punctuated by staccato pops of commentary, with seemingly random accelerations, decelerations and abnormal stresses added for effect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about health care, Moynihan begins by asking, ""In ... what dec-ade ... of this century was the ran-dom patient ... with the random ailment ... encountering the random doctor betteroffforcare?"" (His answer: ""Ah, the, ah, fifth decade. .. . Penicillin ... was probably when they stopped hurt-ing people."") After Moynihan suggests I turn off my tape recorder and breaks out a bottle of sherry his lazily brilliant banter grows even more compelling. At one point, for example, a call to the hideaway from his wife, an expert in the gardens of Mogul India and also his chief political adviser, prompted an elaboration of her recent discoveries about the original design of the Taj Mahal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his seemingly endless erudition, Moynihan is not a pedant. He is someone with a keen awareness of the past's presence. I remember watching Moynihan's performance during the debate on the Persian Gulf war, one of those rare recent occasions when senators actually showed up and took their seats. Most gave ghostwritten comments retailing arguments familiar to anyone who'd been following the debate. Moynihan gave an original, discursive lecture on the history of the British Mandate in Iraq and international law, the point of which was that Kuwait was a nasty country not worth defending. His conclusion that America shouldn't go to war may look like a mistake in retrospect. But Moynihan put the issue in a perspective that was otherwise lacking that day. In the world's greatest deliberative body, he was one of just a few who could fairly be described as deliberating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whoever succeeds him is bound to seem a minor figure by comparison. Neither Rick Lazio nor Hillary Clinton will ever approach Moynihan in intellect, style or wit. It's also a safe assumption that either one of them will view the job of senator far more narrowly than Moynihan did. They will try to leave their imprint on legislation, deliver federal dollars back to New York, service their constituents and get re-elected. They will spend their spare moments not writing, thinking and debating, but fund-raising and ""listening."" In other words, they will try to be effective in ways that most senators now are, but that Moynihan never was.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The New Fronierstan Moynihan serving as an adviser in the Kennedy administration, with Vice President Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leaving the Left</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Robert Kennedy in 1967, the year he called the liberal left ""rigid and destructive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican Interlude President-elect Nixon announcing the selection of Moynihan as his chief domestic policy adviser.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pragmatic Intellectual</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan in 1981, during his first term as senator</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from New York. He was elected in 1976.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a parochial way, New Yorkers will probably be better off. Moynihan has spent 24 years pointing out the imbalance of finances that afflicts New York in an annual report he calls ""the fisc."" A Senator Clinton or a Senator Lazio would spend less time trying to understand this problem and more time laying claim to a few more defense contracts. That's how Charles Schumer views the job, as did the man he replaced, Alfonse D'Amato. As Moynihan's friend John Chafee once joked: ""You write Moynihan about a passport and you get a history of the passport office. You write D'Amato about a passport and you get the passport."" With Lazio or Clinton, you'll get the passport.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Senate will surely be worse off, having lost its greatest character, its sole intellectual, its chief gadfly and its finest literary stylist. And it will also have lost something more. Though he is far from a type, Moynihan is the last of the breed that the framers of the Constitution envisioned residing in the upper chamber. Their notion of a bicameral legislative branch was that the lower house would be fully representative, while the upper house would be only indirectly so, providing a check on momentary enthusiasms and majoritarian passions. In contrast to the House, the Senate was to be more about policy than politics, focused on national rather than local concerns and geared to slowing things down through careful deliberation rather than making things happen. Visiting Washington in the 1830's, Alexis de Tocqueville found the intended distinction borne out in practice. ""When one enters the House of Representatives at Washington,"" he wrote, ""one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. One can often look in vain for a single famous man. . . . A couple of paces away is the entrance to the Senate, whose narrow precincts contain a large proportion of the famous men of America. They are eloquent advocates, wise magistrates and noted statesmen. Every word uttered in this assembly would add luster to the greatest parliamentary debates in Europe.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is perhaps the only contemporary senator recognizable in this description. His departure will solidify a change decades in the making: the debasement of the Senate into a glorified version of the more vulgar, impatient and partisan House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO BEgan following Moynihan only in the 1990's sometimes find it hard to understand why an older generation regards him so highly. In the last decade, Moynihan has not been an essential figure in American politics. Rather, his role has often seemed that of a character actor with a stock gag. He wanders onstage to make brilliant remarks, the real point of which seem to be to point out the feebleness of those who fail to appreciate his genius. During the Clinton presidency, his part has been that of the Shakespearean fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One might have expected Moynihan to delight in Clinton's election. Here, after all, was a president whose intellect approached his own and one who shared his self-critical outlook on liberalism. And for a moment, it looked as if Moynihan would be Clinton's collaborator. ""Whatever the president wants, I'll certainly try to get it for him,"" the senator announced in 1993 upon succeeding Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the all-important Finance Committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As soon became evident, however, this offer was entirely hollow. The embattled relationship that ensued can be analyzed at several levels. At the most basic, Moynihan disagreed with the administration. He thought Clinton should first fulfill his campaign promise to reform welfare, the topic nearest the senator's heart. The Clintons wanted to begin with health care, a subject Moynihan had never mastered. On a more general level, Moynihan's learned skepticism about government social policy was a poor match for the optimism and naivete of the first Democratic administration in 12 years. The Clinton people thought they could use social policy to change the world. Moynihan had, after considerable delay, assimilated the failures of the Great .Society he wrote about 25 years earlier. He cited Rossi's Law, so named for the sociologist Peter Rossi: ""the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, at a personal level, there was Moynihan's vanity. The Clintons made a tactical mistake by not love-bombing Moynihan early on. On the other hand, it's possible that no amount of flattery would have been sufficient. Relations took a disastrous turn when Moynihan read a blind quote in Time magazine about himself from a ""top administration official"": ""Moynihan supported Bob Kerrey during the primaries. He's not one of us, and he can't control Finance like Bentsen did. He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to. . . . We'll roll right over him if we have to.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says he knows the quote came from Rahm Emanuel, a Clinton aide. Emanuel, who now works as an investment banker in Chicago, says it wasn't he. In any case, the ""roll over him"" remark pushed Moynihan from skeptic to enemy. Demanding a welfare reform bill, he announced, ""I might just hold health care hostage."" He went on ""Meet the Press"" to declare: ""We don't have a health care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis."" Later, he called the proposed budgetary savings in the Hillary Clinton-Ira Magaziner health care bill ""a fantasy."" Worst of all, he declined to hold Finance Committee hearings on the bill. ""I probably was more assertive than was in order,"" he says today, with considerable understatement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Moynihan's criticisms were on the mark. He was correct in arguing that a major piece of social legislation like health care reform shouldn't pass the way the Clinton team thought it could - by a slim, partisan majority. Moynihan was also right in asserting that politically, it would have been wiser to do welfare reform first. But in other respects, Moynihan was mistaken. He became fixated on the idea that health care inflation was caused by the phenomenon of ""cost disease,"" an ailment diagnosed by his friend the New York University economist William Baumol, who developed it in relation to the economics of the performing arts. Because productivity increases are not possible in certain service industries, Baumol postulated, costs rise inexorably Moynihan had Baumol testify before the Finance Committee, and then had Hillary Clinton to lunch at his Pennsylvania Avenue apartment to meet with Baumol.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Baumol's disease doesn't afflict health care, an industry in which magnificent productivity increases have proven possible thanks to medical technology and pharmaceuticals. The cause of runaway health care inflation, as the Clinton social engineers understood, was a third-party-payer system in which users had no incentives to limit the expenses they generated. Thanks mainly to the rise of managed care, medical inflation was declining even as Moynihan repeated his analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he now think he was wrong about all this? ""I guess I was,"" Moynihan told me. ""You start getting robots to do the work and you start getting pills to do the work. One pill, Zantac, cut the number of stomach operations by 80 percent.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>if he missed this trend, it may have been because Moynihan's motivation wasn't to repair health care. Baumol was proxy for his view of grand social policy schemes in general - that they inevitably cost far more than we expect, have massive unintended consequences and often fail to make the problem better. Given the possibility that the Clinton plan might pass, Moynihan wanted to be the one who predicted its failure. It was as if he were burying a time capsule of dire warnings that would one day be viewed as prophetic. More than he wanted to shape the outcome, Moynihan wanted to have been right.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something of this phenomenon affected Moynihan's curious behavior in the welfare battie that followed the one over health care. With his vast credibility on the subject of welfare, Moynihan was the logical focal point for a bill that would bring together New Democrats and conservatives. After Republicans took the Congress in 1994, Moynihan, alone in his party, could have shaped what kind of reform bill Congress would pass. Instead, he became first a sphinx, who would not tell anyone the secret of what he supported, then a Cassandra, who screamed bloody murder about what others were trying to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the problem was Moynihan's pride of authorship in a reform bill that passed in 1988, the Family Support Act. It's possible to argue that the 1988 bill opened the door to the more effective conditioning of welfare benefits on work that was passed in 1996. But Moynihan seemed to take the position that the very discussign of the topic implied that his attempt of eight years earlier had failed - which, in fact, it had. The other part of the problem was his view that illegitimacy, a major factor in the lives of welfare recipients, was too little understood and too hard to discuss openly to support an effective governmental response.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once Republicans captured Congress and passed an actual bill containing a stringent version of time-limited welfare, Moynihan became uncharacteristically hysterical, arguing that it would put thousands of children in the streets. He had found something worse than grandiose social policy efforts by liberals - radical reform by conservatives. Moynihan's horrified opposition to the bill was persuasive to many at the time (myself included). But while the final verdict may not be written until the next economic downturn, mounting evidence suggests that he was wrong. Unlike all previous welfare reform efforts, the Personal Responsibility Act has reduced welfare rolls considerably - by more than 50 percent. Births out of wedlock, which began to decline in 1994, have continued to do so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's relations with the administration, meanwhile, grew worse. ""I kept getting into sort of unnecessary troubles,"" he says. He leapt at the opportunity in a ""Meet the Press"" appearance to call for an independent counsel investigation of Whitewater, which he now refers to as ""something I should never have done."" He also maligned the administration gratuitously. In a meeting at The New York Post after the 1996 campaign finance scandal, Moynihan cracked to the paper's editorial board: ""Everyone has Chinese arms merchants to lunch. Don't you?"" IN RETROSPECT, IT IS CLINTON WHO APpears to have been right about many of the major economic and social policy issues of the 1990's, while Moynihan was making a muddle of his past positions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What went wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To understand why the 90's were so unkind to Moynihan's reputation, you have to know something of his past. And this is murky territory, dominated by a subject who loves to revise his own history and cultivate his own myths. For instance, Moynihan has never made any real effort to correct the widely held belief that he grew up in the urban jungle of New York's Hell's Kitchen. In fact, as was noted in a recent biography of Moynihan written by his friend, the English journalist Godfrey Hodgson, Moynihan ""didn't sleep a night in Hell's Kitchen until he had a college degree and a commission in the United States Navy."" He was born in 1927 in Oklahoma, where his fathey worked as a reporter. As a young child, Pat lived in comfortable middle-class environs in Queens, Nassau County and suburban New Jersey. But when he was 10, his alcoholic father abandoned his family, never to be seen again by his eldest son. The family fell into a downward spiral, and Pat did spend some time in East Harlem. The Hell's Kitchen interlude, however, occurred in 1947, when Pat, on his way from the Navy to Tufts, worked as a substitute bartender in a saloon his mother ran for a time on West 42nd Street.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Fulbright Scholarship took Moynihan to the London School of Economics, where he underwent a theatrical transformation. The self-consciously working-class Irish roustabout molted into an English dandy, replete with bowler hat, monocle and umbrella. But the career Moynihan sought upon his return was in politics, not scholarship. Moynihan met a well-connected New York lawyer on the boat ride back, which led to a job on Robert Wagner's campaign for mayor, which led to a job working on Averell Harriman's campaign forgovernor and then to a speechwriting job on Harriman's staff in Albany</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>upstate Retreat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan at his farm in Pindars Corners, about 70 miles west of Albany. The Irrelevant Senator With President Clinton.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clashes with the new administration put Moynihan on the outside in policy formulation, despite the disdain</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>he shared with Clinton for the traditional left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 after a friend recommended him to Arthur Goldberg, the newly appointed secretary of labor. Despite intense ambition and efforts to ingratiate himself, Moynihan never penetrated the Kennedy inner circle. By the time J.AK. was assassinated, however he had begun to make a mark with projects like his effort to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and his study ""One Third of a Nation,"" which contended that many young men, poorly educated and untrained, faced lifetimes of unemployment or work in low-skill jobs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He no longer had to worry about making a name for himself after the spring of 1965, when controversy erupted over another study he wrote for the Labor Department, ""The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,"" a k a the Moynihan Report. The story of the report, the hostile reception it received from many civil rights leaders and its subsequent vindication has been told many times. To read it today is to be struck by the continued trenchancy of Moynihan's insight that family breakup was becoming the chief obstacle to the goal of racial equality, and also by its style - one of analytical boldness out of character for a government report, even one intended for internal consumption.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing on work by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the historian of slavery Stanley Elkins, Moynihan diagnosed a crisis in the structure of the black family. American slavery had been especially vicious, forbidding marriage and denying men the ability to provide for their families. This had encouraged a ""matrifocal"" family structure, which was worsened by racism and discrimination. With few economic opportunities, black men could not be good husbands and fathers. This led them to a pattern Moynihan was only too familiar with: desertion, disordered one-parent households and what he called in a phrase from the sociologist Kenneth Clark, a ""tangle of pathology."" One-parent families produced a disproportionate number of delinquents, dropouts and drug abusers. Moynihan also noted a salient fact: the number of new welfare cases, which had previously tracked the unemployment rate for blacks, had begun to rise even as unemployment fell. This suggested that antidiscrimination laws were insufficient to the goal of racial equality.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To that end, Moynihan supported a range of policies designed to enhance ""the stability and resources of the Negro American family"" jobs programs, housing programs, birth control assistance and what came to be known as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But because his goal was to stimulate a government commitment to addressing the problem, Moynihan's report did not pursue the question of what remedies might work best. In part, this was a reaction to the War on Poverty debate his side had just lost. Moynihan, coming from Labor, wanted a jobs program. Sargent Shriver and others from the newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity were attracted to the modish strategy of ""community action,"" which meant involving poor people in the programs created to help them. Moynihan didn't want to dissuade the Johnson administration from acting by reviving the quarrel. At another level, passing from diagnosis to cure meant moving from the realm of the known to what was perhaps unknowable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Giving short shrift to solutions proved, however, to be a major political blunder. Because it de-emphasized the question of what government should do to help the black family, the Moynihan Report was taken by many on the left as potential fodder for racists who believed blacks were inferior and government could do nothing to help them. His depiction of blacks as deeply damaged by the vicious character of American slavery was taken as criticism of blacks rather than of white society. But it was the attention Moynihan paid to rising out-of-wedlock births that sparked the greatest outrage. While few disputed his statistics,. many civil rights leaders took the position that for a white man to deliver this news to a white audience could bring only harm. In the famous formulation, Moynihan was ""blaming the victim""; he was also accused of both subtle and explicit racism. The Labor Department disowned the report. President Johnson, who may not have ever read it, ignored it. Moynihan resigned and relocated to New York City, where he began an unsuccessful campaign for the presidency of the City Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The attacks on his report sent Moynihan into the deepest depression of his life, which he rode out at Wesleyan before taking up a professorship at Harvard. It also left him in a curious position: a liberal despised by his own kind. With increasing vehemence, he returned the sentiment. A similar response to James Coleman's 1966 study of equal opportunity in education, which showed that parental income had more effect on educational outcomes than any other factor, ratified Moynihan's breach with the left.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with his friends clustered around a new magazine called The Public Interest - Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, James Q. Wilson - Moynihan was reacting to evidence that the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society were failing to achieve their goals. @km- Wing the responses of this circle, Moynihan's was the most political. He didn't give up on social policy as an instrument of change - at least at first. He gave up instead on the supporters of social policy the people who had maligned and abused him. Moynihan concluded that what we would today call political correctness was undermining the ability of government to do anything for the disadvantaged. ""The liberal left can be as rigid and destructive Continued on Page 68 as any force in American life,"" he wrote in Commentary in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senior Statesman Moynihan walking the halls of Congress with Senator Patrick Leahy last year. After 24 years in the Senate, Moynihan did not seek reelection to a fifth term.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vilification also initiated what might be described as a career-long quest for exoneration. To be sure, Moynihan remained politically ambitious. But more than professional success, he demanded his due, to be acknowledged as a seer, not just about the black family, but about every topic he touched upon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER ROBERT Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Moynihan was left without significant ties within the Democratic Party. By the end of that year's presidential campaign, he was writing obsequious notes to Richard Nixon. Nixon, who had admired Moynihan's articles in Commentary, approached him after the election with an offer to become his chief domestic policy adviser. Having two Harvardpedigree professors, Moynihan and Henry Kissinger, helped assuage Nixon's own insecurities. Moynihan knew just how to flatter Nixon, telling him that he was a 20th-century Disraeli. In Nixon, he also found the ideal audience for his eviscerations of upper-class liberals.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's role in a Republican White House was at once that of policy maker and ideological warrior. He argued for maintaining Great Society programs he had earlier criticized, not because he had decided they could be made to work, but rather because doing otherwise would play into the hands of liberals. The same justification underpinned the welfare reform scheme he got Nixon to support, the so-called Family Assistance Plan, which was based on the idea of a guaranteed income to every poor famfly. The FAP, Moynihan's most audacious attempt at social policy, was based on an idea contained in his report on the black family: that welfare contained an incentive to family breakup, since only single mothers qualified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with his plan was that it was at odds with everything else he had learned, both about the destructive effects of welfare and about the potential for social engineering to produce massive unintended consequences. And indeed, subsequent experiments showed that a guaranteed income increased rather than reduced rates of marital breakup - presumably because it freed men from the need to support their families. That Moynihan didn't anticipate this result can only be explained by politics: he thought the FAP would destroy the left by pre-empting its demands. After the Family Assistance Plan died in Congress, Moynihan wrote ""The Politics of a Guaranteed Income,"" his longest and most serious book, lay.ing. the blame on liberals who opposed the plan because benefit levels weren't set high enough. To create a noble failure seemed almost the point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Moynihan was in Washington fighting fire with FAP, student radicals were threatening to burn down his house in Cambridge, forcing his wife and children to evacuate. In this context, in January 1970, he wrote Nixon another of his acerbic memos. He argued that blacks were making steady progress but that black-on-black violence, radicalism and reverse racism against whites were undermining it. Moynihan thought that the most useful thing the administration could do would be to damp down rhetoric and create more jobs for unemployed black men. ""The time may have come,"" he noted, ""when the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign neglect.""' After Nixon distributed the memo to his cabinet, a copy leaked to The New York Times, and the phrase, taken out of context, was used to bolster the accusation that he was a racist. To Moynihan, the reaction underscored the lesson he had drawn from the Moynihan Report: that liberals would never treat him fairly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was, in fact, edging toward the view that critics accused him of holding: that racial and social problems were hopeless - at least so long as the left blocked sensible discussion and action. When Nixon offered to send him to New Delhi as the American ambassador, Moynihan leapt at the opportunety. India was a good place to sit out Watergate and what remained of the Nixon administration. It also got Moynihan thinking about why America was so hated in the third world. In 1975, he distilled his views into an article for Commentary, ""The United States in Opposition."" The essay, which set out to explain why the United States was so often in the minority in the United Nations, dissected the lock step anti-Americanism of the so-called nonaligned nations. On the basis of the article, Kissinger recommended that Gerald Ford make Moynihan the United States ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the United Nations, Moynihan proceeded to do what he recommended. Unwilling to accept the State Department's preference for diplomatic inoffensiveness, he denounced, in the loudest possible terms, the hypocrisies of third world dictatorships. After Idi Amin addressed the General Assembly, Moynihan attacked him as a ""racist murderer."" This was too much for the bureaucracy at State, which distanced itself from Moynihan's remarks, and even for Kissinger, who drove him out after only eight months in the job. But in New York, Moynihan became a hero for his powerful denunciations of the resolution equating Zionism with racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan deserves great credit for his work at the United Nations, even if his accomplishment was mainly a rhetorical one. What he did there was to forcefully articulate a consistent liberal internationalism, based on democracy and respect for human rights, at a time when noninterventionism and skepticism about America's role in the world were becoming dominant strains in the Democratic Party. Indeed, looking back at the 1970's as a whole, Moynihan appears as a liberal loyalist even though he spent half the decade serving Republican presidents. Unlike many of his fellow neoconservatives, Moynihan never entirely abandoned either Democrats or the idea of an activist government, at home or abroad. He simply argued that liberals needed to be smarter, more selfcritical and empirically driven. Ending his seven-year Republican exile, he announced his Senate candidacy as a Democrat in 1976. With the help of a divided left and an endorsement from The New York Times, he won a narrow victory. EARLY ON, HE EStablished what kind of senator he would be. Moynihan would not dominate a single field, as Russell Long did with defense, or build a record of legislative accomplishment on social issues, as Ted Kennedy has done. After Moynihan's four terms, the sole major bill to, his credit is the 1991 transportation bill known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or Istea, a grab bag that has done little even to advance his own goal of supporting public transportation. Nor would Moynihan excel at pork barrel like Robert Byrd or constituent service like Al D'Amato.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Moynihan would prove superior was in bringing his understanding to bear on debates that otherwise might have taken place in a kind of historical and intellectual vacuum. His metier was performance in the Finance Committee and on the Senate floor, which he would hold with sardonic, digressive lectures. These speeches were most trenchant during the early Reagan years, when Moynihan found his voice in opposition. To the chagrin of his allies in the neoconservative movement, he opposed the invasion of Grenada and denounced the C.LA.'s covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. A more consistent Wilsonian than Reagan, Moynihan argued that both actions violated international law. As a crude measure of his evolving views, his rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action soared from 47 percent in 1979 to 95 percent in 1982.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the introduction to his 1988 collection of speeches, lectures and articles, ""Came the Revolution,"" Moynihan paints his shifting stance as a bit of mystery even to himself. He records that ""something in the new administration had sent me into opposition in a way I had not ever been before, not felt before."" In retrospect, he points to two other factors. One was the refusal of conservatives to recognize that the Soviet Union was on its last legs. The other was his analysis of the Reagan budget deficits. Moynihan believed that they were an intentional effort to make it impossible for liberals to expand the federal government. David Stockman, the intellectual behind the budgetary disaster of the 1980's, had worked as a baby sitter for the Moynihans in Cambridge in the late 1960's. At the Gridiron Club dinner of 1981, the senator lampooned his protege's evolving enthusiasms. ""I have never known a man capable of such sustained self-hypnotic ideological fervor,"" Moynihan said. ""One day he arrives at Harvard preaching the infallibility of Ho Chi Minh. Next thing you know, he turns up in Washington proclaiming the immutability of the Laffer Curve.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As fine a period as the early 1980's was for him, he failed to emerge either as a leader of the anti-Reagan opposition in Congress or as a savior of the Democrats. In truth he lacked the discipline, focus and organization to lead. Where other senators cultivated a loyal, long-serving staff, the irascible Moynihan produced a distinguished alumni association. His current chief of staff, Tony Bullock, is his 17th in 24 years - and the record holder at four years on the job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Somehow, whenever Moynihan turned from analysis to action, he always seemed to lose himself in the old thickets of revenge, pride and Pyrrhic victory. This was certainly true of the 1988 Family Support Act. The bill, which was the only major welfare reform passed into law until Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored Personal Responsibility Act in 1996, was in principle an attempt to condition welfare on work. But Moynihan resisted the Reagan administration's push for something resembling workfare on the grounds that liberals wouldn't support it. Thanks to abundant loopholes in the bill, only a tiny fraction of recipients ended up working. In the years following the bill's passage, welfare rolls continued to rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan's inspired idea of a Social Security tax break, which he proposed in 1991, is another case in point. Having served on the commission that created the Social Security Trust Fund to provide for the retirement of the baby boom generation, Moynihan became incensed that Social Security surpluses were being used to mask the depth of the Reagan deficits. He said that if George Bush, who was then president, wouldn't address the problem, Social Security taxes should be reduced and the system returned to a pay-asyou-go basis. What was brilliant about his idea was that it used the Republican device of a big tax cut to call the bluff of fiscally irresponsible conservatives. The idea had legs. Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation quickly got on board, scaring the wits out of Bush administration officials. But Moynihan left his proposal to dangle and die. After announcing it, he departed on a three-week tour of Africa and the Middle East. In the final analysis, he didn't want a Social Security tax cut. He wanted to make a point.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why wasn't Moynihan more effective? The familiar explanation, no longer spoken in whispers, was his fondness for drink. Hodgson, whose standards are English, says his friend the senator drinks merely a proper amount. He notes that Moynihan these days imbibes nothing stronger than Tio Pepe sherry, which his aides jokingly refer to as ""the Mexican ambassador"" (as in, ""don't bother him he's with the Mexican ambassador"").</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the drinking, however, there is the more significant matter of Moynihan's temperament. Like Nixon, he lacked the largeness of spirit necessary to transcend his animosities. When the opportunity to address social policy questions arose again after Clinton was elected, Moynihan remained too obsessed with the past to engage in another reform effort. He thought of the Clintonites as arrogant liberals of the type who had demonized him in the 1960's and 70's. Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala's connections to the Children's Defense Fund, which had opposed his 1988 welfare bill, especially set him off. For him, the political had become entirely personal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This temperament ultimately made Moynihan a better critic of politics than practitioner, a man with a greater aptitude for analysis than for accomplishment. Thinking and writing are activities that come naturally to him. Getting things done has always been a challenge. This was something that Moynihan recognized about himself early on. There's a striking comment in a letter written to a friend in his graduate school days that Douglas Schoen quotes in his 1979 biography of Moynihan, ""Pat."" Moynihan described himself as having ""almost first-class critical intelligence"" but ""secondclass abilities."" This inversion of Justice Holmes's famous assessment of ED.R. was all too acute. Moynihan's awareness of the odds against successful government action, and the perpetual tendency among his fellow politicians to ignore those odds, has made him a brilliant critic of politics. But it also prevented him from becoming a top-level political practitioner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Henry James somewhere describes a mind too fine to be violated by an idea,"" says Moynihan's old friend Irving Kristol. ""Pat really was too much of a thinker to be violated by politics.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS HE APPROACHES REtirement, Moynihan seems to have been devoting most of his time to writing and arguing that he was right. And to be sure, he was ahead of others on many issues. Moynihan was a lonely worrier about automobile safety in the late 1950's, before Ralph Nader happened upon the scene. He has never quite proved that the Reagan deficits were an intentional conspiracy to undermine domestic government, but he was certainly correct that they would have that effect. And in his most famous analysis, Moynihan was on the mark in arguing that the increasing rate of family breakup in the black community was a catastrophe in the making.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many other cherished prophecies, which he touts to the point of obnoxiousness in his 1996 book, ""Miles to Go,"" fall apart on closer examination. Moynihan asserts, for instance, that he alone foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, in a 1979 article in Newsweek. His writings from the 70's yield statements that can be taken as predictions of just the opposite. But even if Moynihan gets credit for forecasting that the Soviet Union would fall, he was mostly wrong about the reasons. Moynihan focused on the problem of ethnicity; he thought Uzbeks and Tajiks would throw off the chains of their colonial oppressors. Something like that happened in Yugoslavia, but ethnic conflict was a relatively minor factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Moynihan drew the wrong implication from his prediction as well. He used it as an argument against the Reagan military buildup. But that buildup hastened the Soviet collapse. We spent them into bankruptcy. (""We spent ourselves into bankruptcy!"" Moynihan told me, in response to this line of argument.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To read Moynihan's earlier writings is to encounter an incisive intelligence and a fine, mandarin style (now sadly dissolved into a kind of self-absorbed baroque). It is also to come across a plethora of other forecasts that we would have heard a great deal about had they been borne out. Just before Richard Nixon was elected, Moynihan predicted that Democrats would continue to hold power with no real challenge from conservatives for decades to come. Around the same time, he asserted that the nation was about to suffer grievous division on the issue of public subsidies for parochial schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan does himself an injustice by encouraging us to judge his career by his predictions. In the end, it's a matter of limited interest, since no one can forecast the future with any consistency. What is more important than prophecy is analysis, and here Moynihan has few peers in politics. Since the 1950's, he has played a role unique in American politics, bringing a vast knowledge of history and social science to bear on the practical questions of what government does. Even if his conclusions have often been wrong, his insights have been genuine. For the past two and half decades, Moynihan's thinking and argument have deepened and complicated American political discourse - something that can be said for what other senator of his time?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years thoughtful statesman types like Moynihan have given way to another type, furiously aggressive and ideological. Bob Dole has gone and been replaced by Trent Lott, Bill Bradley by Bob Torricelli, Harris Wofford by Rick Santorum. These transitions have left the Senate a bitter and impatient place, a glorified version of the Gingrich House which is where most of the new breed came from. Replacing Moynihan with Clinton or Lazio will complete the unfortunate process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""In '94 and '96 we took the topsoil off that place with the people who left,"" says Bob Kerrey, the senator from Nebraska who, like Moynihan, did not seek re-election this year. ""But the real engine for making the Senate more like the House is Trent Lott. The reason you don't see the great debates is that Lott operates it like the House, limiting debate, and he doesn't like the messy amendment process.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan says much the same thing. ""The notion is that there is a majority, and it will vote for what the leaders of the majority think,"" he told me. ""The other side really doesn't have anything to say.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The institution has also collapsed socially. Instead of the old afterhours, across-the-aisle friendships developed over drinks, lunches and dinners, there are now ceaseless rounds of fund-raising solicitation and media appearances. To not return to your home state every weekend is to court a backlash from voters watching to see if their representative has ""lost touch.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Television has emptied the Senate floor,"" Moynihan says. ""That and money, money, money. It used to be that people would start drifting over around 5, then go out to dinner at 8. Now you go to vote and turn around and go back. On the floor is somebody with charts looking up at the TV cameras. It may be at my age that my middle years just seem more agreeable, but it was much more collegial. People talked. There was a high order of civility""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moynihan is in no hurry to leave the job he has held for 24 years. According to a close associate, the decision to retire this year was more his wife's than his. After serious back surgery his stamina is not what it was. But in the end, Moynihan seems relieved to go because of the way the institution has deteriorated. An Oxbridge common room doesn't work if no one shows up for conversation. And these days, hardly anyone does. Moynihan's only remaining close friend, Kerrey, is leaving with him. The others are either dead, like Chafee, or retired, like Bradley, Dole and Bob Packwood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""There's no one left in the building he can have a glass of sherry with at the end of the day,"" says Moynihan's aide Tony Bullock.

Brown</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''Racism on Trial: The Chicano Fight for Justice.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With commemorations from coast to coast to remind them, most Americans already know that this week was the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Unfortunately, what they don't realize is that the country missed an equally important anniversary two weeks ago, that of Hernandez v. Texas -- the perennially overshadowed antecedent to Brown that was decided on May 3, 1954.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That case merits commemoration not just because the Supreme Court used it to finally extend constitutional protection to Mexican-Americans, important though that is, especially now that Latinos are the largest minority group. It's worth celebrating because Hernandez got right something that Brown did not: the standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hernandez involved jury discrimination, which the court had long prohibited. The question in Hernandez, unlike in Brown, was not whether the state's conduct was unconstitutional; it was whether the Constitution protected Mexican-Americans. But the dynamics of the case prevented the court from answering that question by reasoning that Mexican-Americans, like blacks, constituted a racial minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's because the political and social leaders of the Mexican-American community at that time argued for equality not on the ground that discrimination was wrong per se, but because they were white. Texas, in turn, harnessed this argument to its defense, pointing out that if Mexican-Americans were white, so too were the persons seated on Texas juries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because both sides insisted that Mexican-Americans were white, Hernandez v. Texas forced the court to confront directly a question it would sidestep in Brown: under precisely what circumstances did some groups deserve constitutional protection? Hernandez offered a concise answer: when groups suffer subordination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws,'' the court wrote. But, it said, ''other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need the same protection.'' Succor from state discrimination, the court reasoned, should apply to every group socially defined as different and, implicitly, as inferior. ''Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact,'' the court said, one that may be demonstrated ''by showing the attitude of the community.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How, then, did the Texas community where Hernandez arose regard Mexican-Americans? Here the court catalogued Jim Crow practices: business and community groups largely excluded Mexican-Americans; a local restaurant displayed a sign announcing ''No Mexicans Served''; children of Mexican descent were shunted into a segregated school and then forced out altogether after the fourth grade; on the county courthouse grounds there were two men's toilets, one unmarked and the other marked ''Colored Men'' and ''Hombres Aqui'' (''Men Here'').</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same sort of caste system that oppressed blacks in Texas also harmed Mexican-Americans. But it was Jim Crow as group subordination, rather than as a set of ''racial'' distinctions, that called forth the Constitution's concern in Hernandez v. Texas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Brown v. Board of Education also responded to group mistreatment. But the court did not state in sufficiently explicit terms that school segregation violated the Constitution because it constituted systematic oppression, rather than because it turned on race. This small lapse left open just enough space for the misreading of Brown that now dominates conservative thinking on antidiscrimination law -- including on the Supreme Court. Brown, the majority now contends, stands for the proposition that the Constitution opposes not noxious practices of oppression but instead only the state use of formal racial distinctions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The anti-caste commitment of Brown lies today distorted, and its efficacy as constitutional law largely eroded. Treating every official use of race as akin to racism, the Supreme Court erects virtually insurmountable constitutional hurdles against all race-conscious government action. No statement better captures this misguided equation of Jim Crow and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> than Justice Clarence Thomas's assertion that there is ''a moral and constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the court protects from constitutional challenge situations in which racism operates powerfully but not explicitly. For example, even after conceding that Georgia sentenced to death blacks who killed whites 22 times more often than blacks who killed blacks, the court upheld Georgia's death penalty machinery. Under 14th Amendment law, any use of race encounters the same constitutional hostility; but systematic discrimination, if not expressly based on race, receives the Constitution's blessing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current court reasons as if Brown held that it is race per se, rather than racism and maltreatment, that offends the Constitution. In this, Brown itself is partly to blame. Confident that the 14th Amendment protected blacks, Chief Justice Earl Warren in Brown did not expressly explain why this was so: not because they were a race, but because they were oppressed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the title ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said,'' Jack Balkin, a Yale law school professor, recently enlisted legal scholars to rewrite that decision in a manner that might have prevented the distortions that now mar constitutional antidiscrimination law. But the exercise is largely unnecessary. Chief Justice Warren already said what Brown should have. He did so two weeks earlier, in Hernandez v. Texas. After 50 years, the time has come for courts and scholars to install Hernandez where it belongs: at the center, with Brown, of a robust 14th Amendment law committed to ending racial subordination.</p></div>"	2			4

Education Today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The concept of diversity has taken on new meaning since Sept. 11.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Suddenly from a nation of atomized individuals we became a collective, in fear, mourning and awareness of having a common identity and perhaps a common fate as Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that collective it suddenly seemed very important that we had many kinds of names and faces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of us began seeing faces we hadn't noticed before. Non- Muslims became aware of Muslims as people to be encountered in an emotional, almost intimate way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On college campuses students began flocking to classes on topics most hadn't much cared about before: Afghanistan, the Middle East, international relations, Islam, Arabic language.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps most important, Americans, in looking in each other's faces and hearing each other's prayers, sought a renewed faith that differences of color or religion or ethnic background don't have to lead to implacable enmity and mutual destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context it is worth reconsidering the venerable arguments about whether furthering diversity on college campuses constitutes a compelling national interest to the extent that universities should consider race and ethnicity in their admissions policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A series of conflicting court decisions in the last year have brought the debate over what is called the ""diversity rationale"" to a fever pitch, and the U.S. Supreme Court may have the final say. Different federal judges have ruled that race-conscious admissions policies are permissible to foster diversity for University of Michigan undergraduates, but not at the law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other jurists have decided that such policies are fitting at the University of Washington law school, but not for undergraduates at the University of Georgia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Implementation of such policies is different at each school, and the varied techniques may have played some part in the decisions. But the arguments on both sides always come back to the issue of whether diversity is a compelling enough interest to warrant going beyond tests and numbers in the direction of race and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The diversity rationale has taken the place of another accepted standard--remedying vestiges of past racial discrimination--because past bias is hard to pin down, especially outside the South. Diversity as a positive educational goal, beneficial to all students in an institution, makes a more compelling case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is of immediate importance only in flagship public universities throughout the country, as other state schools generally admit the vast majority of applicants. Private schools, however, might be held to whatever standard is finally applied.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going to the right college, or to a top law or business or medical school, means a lot in this country. Not everything, fortunately, but still a lot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to insist that merit, determined by the test scores and grades, should be the only admission standard. We are all equal before the numbers, which are blind to color, gender and ethnicity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But merit obviously takes many forms, and numbers themselves can be relative. Is a 1300 SAT score by a New Trier student from a wealthy family really more meritorious than an 1100 by a low-income teenager from the South Side?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clearly there is some lower limit on capability: Students must be able to do the work. And some studies show comparatively high dropout rates for students admitted to selective schools through <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there also is evidence that such students actually do better at top schools than their counterparts (for instance, black students with similar test scores) at less-selective schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crucial question is whether, in a world in which pluralistic values suddenly seem so important, the top schools can afford to cut minority admissions. One landmark study says a race-blind policy could slice the number of black students at these schools to as little as a quarter of the current total.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>University of Illinois Chancellor Nancy Cantor said in the aftermath of Sept. 11 that she has given the issue a lot of thought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""How does one see that we're not all the same, that we haven't traveled the same path and that we have to be able to see the world from the other person's eyes? That for me is at the center of why I believe so firmly that higher education has to be diverse,"" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We don't naturally come to see other sides; we need to learn how to do that, we need to have the social context and the learning context where we can get outside of ourselves.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the weeks after Sept. 11, students felt vulnerable and wanted to reach out to others without quite knowing how, she added. And of course there were ugly incidents, including a brawl in a campus bar after an attack on an Indian student.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""What I keep saying at events here is that it's terribly important in a crisis to see people as individuals and not as groups, not as a religion,"" she said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""For many of our students, college life is the first time they actually have a chance to live and work in a diverse environment.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of the diversity rationale say you can have stimulating, diverse ideas without a diverse student body. Not so. There is no substitute for that direct encounter with someone whose difference is a challenge to the heart and mind.</p></div>"		1		4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2216641847.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Madman Theory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I had breakfast this week with one of Hollywood’s most ferocious, self-confident and successful doers of deals. He was still steamed about what an unforgivably lousy negotiator his president had been on the debt ceiling agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One particular Obama move he found appalling above all the rest. “There is a provision in our Constitution that speaks to making sure that the United States meets its obligations,” the president had said, referring to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, “and there have been some suggestions” — by Bill Clinton and various legal scholars — “that a president could use that language to basically ignore that debt ceiling rule.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my Hollywood supernegotiator friend, Obama should’ve stopped right there — or, even better, followed up with that standard ambiguous saber-rattling line: “No option is off the table.” Raising the possibility of unilateral executive action would’ve strengthened his hand against the Republicans. Instead, Mr. Transparent and Reasonable instantly ruled it out in the weakest way possible: “I have talked to my lawyers. They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My friend recited the president’s surrender sentence incredulously, slipping an obscene seven-letter gerund in front of lawyers. Since the Republicans were threatening to go nuclear in unprecedented fashion, why didn’t the president at least threaten to use his unprecedented nuclear option to stop them?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, it’s a pity Barack Obama isn’t more like Richard Nixon. I think of Nixon every year around now, as another anniversary of his resignation (Tuesday the 9th) rolls around. President Nixon famously tried convincing the Communists that he might literally go nuclear if they didn’t behave. “I call it the Madman Theory,” he explained to his chief of staff. “I want the North Vietnamese to believe that I’ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, a lot of us swooned over Obama partly because he seemed so prudent, straightforward and even-keeled. But now, with Republicans spectacularly applying the Madman Theory for the first time in domestic politics, Obama’s nonconfrontational reasonableness isn’t looking like such a virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It’s frustrating. We’ve had presidents who were intelligent and progressive but also cynical and ruthless when necessary. Effective, tough-minded, visionary liberals such as F.D.R., Clinton ... and Nixon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In popular imagination, Nixon remains nothing but a great goblin — scowling bomber of Southeast Asia, panderer to fear and racism, paranoid anti-Semite, dispatcher of burglars — but the truth is, he governed further to the left than any president who followed him. The overreaching Euro-socialist nanny state that today’s Republicans despise? That blossomed in the Nixon administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Spending on social services doubled, and military budgets actually decreased. He oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. His administration was the first to encourage and enable American Indian tribal autonomy. He quadrupled the staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, almost tripled federal outlays for civil rights and began <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in federal hiring. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment and signed Title IX, the law granting equality to female student athletes. One of his Supreme Court appointees wrote the Roe v. Wade decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon made Social Security cost-of-living increases automatic, expanded food stamps and started Supplemental Security Income for the disabled and elderly poor. It helped, of course, that Democrats controlled the House and Senate. But it was the president, not Congress, who proposed a universal health insurance plan and a transformation of welfare that would have set a guaranteed minimum income and allowed men to remain with their welfare-recipient families. It was Nixon who radically intervened in the free market by imposing wage and price controls, launched détente with the Soviets, normalized relations with Mao’s China and let the Communists win in Vietnam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, for good measure, the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts grew sixfold, by far the biggest increase by any president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of Nixon — Nixon?  — as a de facto liberal provokes cognitive dissonance, especially among people over 50. Facts notwithstanding, they refuse to buy it, as if they’ve been fooled by a parlor trick. But the only trick involved is judging Nixon circa 1970 by the ideological standards of 2011.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My late mother, who voted for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie through George H.W. Bush, became a Democrat in her 70s. “These black hats,” she said of the G.O.P. right, “have gotten as nutty as fruitcakes. Nothing they say shocks me anymore.” She voted five times for Nixon, whose Madman Theory was a tactical posturing to make the Communists think he was an unhinged, reckless fanatic itching to wreak havoc. But a national Republican Party dominated by actually unhinged, reckless fanatics itching to wreak havoc in America? I think that would’ve shocked her. I think it probably would’ve even shocked Nixon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kurt Andersen, the host of public radio's ""Studio 360"" and the author, most recently, of the novel ""Heyday,"" is a guest columnist.</p></div>"			3					6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421214771.xml.txt	"<div><p>National Perspective; Rebirth of Optimism in America Contains Seeds for Altering Politics</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Journalists love earthquakes--the sudden crack in the wall that reveals the shadowy structure hidden beneath. But sometimes it really is more enlightening to watch the paint dry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important changes, in other words, are often the most imperceptible. That's the case with one of the most overlooked stories of the past year: the return of American optimism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is more unusual than it seems. Americans may be, by nature, optimistic about their personal situations. But for most of the past 25 years, precious little of that optimism was evident when they looked toward their country's future. With only brief exceptions since the early 1970s, a majority of Americans--often an overwhelming majority--told pollsters they believed the country was on the wrong track.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, in its attitude toward the future, America is beginning to resemble the country it was through the early 1960s. Though some surveys still produce more ambivalent responses, most polls now show that a plurality of Americans believe the country is moving in the right direction. Consumer confidence is at a 28-year high. In a recent Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of all Americans described themselves as ""highly contented"" with their lives--by far the highest figure recorded in the past 30 years. Even President Clinton is enjoying his rosiest approval ratings ever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have not surrendered their pessimism lightly. But it has been beaten down by a pitiless procession of good news. The economy, now in its sixth year of growth, has driven down unemployment to its lowest level in a quarter century. The federal budget deficit, which once threatened to submerge Washington, is evaporating like a puddle on a sunny day. Crime is way down, and the rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth are stabilizing after years of explosive growth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The return of American optimism, though, is arguably rooted in something more fundamental than any of this. After more than a decade of doubt, America once again considers itself the capital of the future. During the 1980s, many Americans glumly concluded that the 21st century would be forged in places like Tokyo and Taipei. Now, Americans see the future being shaped in Seattle (home of Microsoft, the emblematic company of the Information Age), Hollywood (which sets the beat for global culture) and Silicon Valley (the Finland Station for the computer and Internet revolutions). ""Is this a great time, or what?"" asks MCI in a revealing ad campaign that would have been laughed off the air not long ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Very few politicians have considered the implications of governing a society in which optimism about the future is again the default position. But if it lasts, this rebirth of American confidence could change politics in ways both subtle and profound.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, both the left and the right have framed much of their agenda around constructing a convincing explanation for the anxiety that gnawed at many Americans. Conservatives pointed their fingers at big government, welfare, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, immigrants and the forces of cultural change; liberals targeted the rich, the global economy and big business.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this more optimistic environment, though, those demons are losing their horns. ""There is just less hostility out there,"" says Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. ""It is a lot easier to get people agitated when things aren't going well.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some respects, the politics of international trade remains the great exception to this pattern. Yet even the House rebellion against fast-track trade authority in November marked a subtle shift in attitudes. Ten years ago, trade anxieties focused on the fear that the U.S. could not compete with Japan in the most technologically advanced sectors. Today, trade anxieties are almost completely limited to the fear that the U.S. will lose low-skill jobs to low-wage countries such as Mexico. That's not a trivial concern, but it's a long way from the fear of national economic decline that haunted the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The continued skirmishing over trade doesn't obscure the power of Hart's observation. In good times, it's difficult to mobilize the public behind ideological crusades. In these circumstances, voters prefer incrementalism, not sudden change; rather than polarization, they look for convergence. (Clinton has understood this far better than those Republicans still clamoring for more confrontation.) These days, the dominant message from Americans to their capital seems to be: Get along, compromise and stay out of our way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That message can be very much of a mixed blessing. Indeed, the same can be said about the overall brightening of American attitudes. The good news is that the improved public mood encourages both parties to pursue reasonable compromises on the issues dividing them--as they did to balance the budget last summer. But the risk is that the good feelings can easily slide into triumphalism and complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, for all the positive trends, America still faces serious problems: too many lackluster schools, stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, the impending cost of retiring the baby boom, inner cities where both opportunity and fathers are scarce. History suggests the good times are precisely the moment to tackle such difficult challenges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the prosperity from the end of World War II to the 1973 oil shock, the GI generation laid the foundation for growth: building the interstate highway system and great public universities, subsidizing the development of the semiconductor and the Internet. At the same time, the nation enlarged the circle of opportunity by ending segregation and filled in the social safety net by guaranteeing health care for the elderly and poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That record offers the standard against which history is likely to judge today's leaders. At the moment, Clinton and his Republican rivals appear content to mostly preside over this era of good feelings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the precedent of America's long postwar boom offers a more productive alternative: investing prosperity to sustain prosperity and share its benefits more widely. The lack of public demand for a more ambitious agenda doesn't obviate the need for one. Pessimism is a corrosive force in a nation's life. But so is complacency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: JEFF DANZIGER / For The Times; ID NUMBER: 19980105hmn0108</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: This is Ronald Brownstein's last Washington Outlook column</p></div>"			3					6

The historic ruling settled a 1997 class-action lawsuit initiated by more than 1,000 black farmers that charged the U.S. Agriculture Department with racial discrimination in distributing farm loans and subsidies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The settlement requires the USDA to provide at least $50,000 in cash and debt relief to black farmers who it agrees were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. One provision of the agreement also requires the federal government to return foreclosed lands to affected farmers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>African-Americans were 14 percent of American farmers in 1920 and today they are far less than 1 percent, according to John Boyd Jr., of the National Black Farmers Association. Boyd and other black farmers blame the USDA's discriminatory practices for that rapid land loss and several federal probes of the agency have supported those charges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1982 study by the Civil Rights Commission predicted that black farmers would be extinct by 2000 unless drastic action were taken by the federal government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the 1.4 million people who operated or managed farms in 1995, just 8,000 were black, according to recent figures from the Census Bureau.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Total claims in the recent settlement are expected to exceed $375 million, but the exact figure is impossible to calculate until officials have a better idea of the number of affected farmers. The lawsuit sought $3.5 billion and many farmers are complaining that the settlement is too little too late to be of any real assistance. Despite the inadequacies of the specific settlement, however, it provides the rationale for a more extensive claim of reparations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black farmers initiated the litigation in 1997 after an internal USDA investigation found an entrenched history of anti-black practices, reaffirming what many previous probes concluded. Although the lawsuit focused specifically on the period from 1981 to 1996, it could well have picked any period in American history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The suit argued that the current economic inequities of black farmers--as a ""class""--are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias and that financial compensation helps redress the legacy of that history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That logic also justifies reparations as compensation to African- Americans--as a ""class""--to help redress 2 1/2 centuries of slavery, a century of official apartheid and decades of de facto discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The accumulation of disadvantages blacks suffered during this period--including a coercive diversion of wealth and cultural capital--provide a compelling explanation for current wealth and health disparities between black and white Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In attempts to redress the damage of that history, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has continuously reintroduced, since 1989, a bill designed to examine slavery's impact on African-Americans. His bill, The Commission to Study Reparations Proposals for African-Americans Act, has failed to garner sufficient support and languished in the House.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Arguments favoring reparations not only are logical, they also offer a welcome respite from the acrimonious debates about <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and other preference policies. The cost of federal reparations would be spread throughout the tax system and would be justified by both a cold economic calculus and moral responsibility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sense of responsibility, for example, helps explain why few Germans complain about their country's payments of more than $100 billion to Israel in reparations for damage done to Jewish victims during the Nazi era.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the federal government issued land as reparations for racism was during Reconstruction, when Gen.

Ronald Reagan summoned UC President Clark Kerr to a private meeting in a UC Berkeley conference room. Six hours later, the popular and effective Kerr was fired as punishment for his soft stance on the Free Speech Movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, a shocked Faculty Senate decried the ""repressive political atmosphere"" and worried about its effects on the quality of higher education in California. Students felt betrayed by what they considered Reagan's bald political aspirations. The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper, went so far as to ask: ""Just who runs this university, anyway?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost 30 years later, the UC system faces the same question. This time around, the cause of the trouble is not student protests or a war in Vietnam, but <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Again, politics has reared its disruptive head in the realm of education, with consequences as troubling as those surrounding Kerr's ouster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tug-o'-war began last July, when the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring. Regents were immediately accused of using the UC system to further the political ambitions of Gov. Pete Wilson. After all, Wilson and his Republican predecessors had appointed many of their closest allies to the board and his presidential campaign was in need of a boost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The controversial change in policy sent the nine UC campuses into a frenzy. All nine chancellors opposed the resolution, as did every student government. Activists called for non-compliance, culminating in a huge systemwide walkout on Oct. 12. Most important, the Faculty Senate called for the regents to reverse course, contending that their decision violated the concept of ""shared governance,"" in which regents, UC president, chancellors and faculty strive for consensus before major policy changes are set in motion. Enter Richard C. Atkinson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five months ago, in the midst of the furor spawned by the regents' <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> decision and accusations of political pandering, Atkinson was chosen the new UC president. His first big job was to implement the new policy and draft guidelines that would replace race and gender preferences with socioeconomic criteria.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most introductory political science professors know that if a bureaucracy opposes a new policy directive, that policy will most likely go nowhere. Thus, it wasn't all that surprising when Atkinson announced that he was delaying full implementation of the regents' policy, until fall 1998 for undergraduates, to allow his bureaucracy to come up with suitable alternative guidelines. Like the regents' action in July, politics loomed in the background: While chancellor at UC San Diego, Atkinson was a staunch supporter of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wilson and especially his point man on the Board of Regents, Ward Connerly, contended that, as members of the majority, their policy-making powers were being usurped by the UC president. Atkinson's task, they insisted, was not to interpret their new policy but to enact it, as his job description mandates. Connerly and nine other regents called for a special meeting to review Atkinson's performance--the first such meeting since Kerr's fateful summons in 1967.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The threat was obvious and it worked, just as Connerly and Wilson had hoped it would. Atkinson officially apologized for overstepping his bounds and vowed to step up implementation of the new policies by one semester. The meeting was called off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The squabbling among the high brass of the university will no doubt continue until the new socioeconomic guidelines are implemented, if ever. Yet, the problem of who is actually running the University of California is one that will probably never be resolved.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Doubtless, the regents' action in July was, in part, motivated by Wilson's desire to energize his presidential campaign. But Atkinson's decision was no less political. The difference is that the regents have the state Constitution on their side.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The state of California gives the regents full power to set policy and conduct all business relating to the university. The UC president, even though he sits on the board as one of its non-appointed members, is delegated the responsibility of enacting the will of the body as a whole. In this case, Atkinson had no right to go over the regents' head, and after realizing this, he retreated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the larger issue here is the consequences that this political battle will have for the university as it prepares to educate a new generation of students. After all, the regents' new policy also calls for more outreach programs to help increase the eligibility rates of underprivileged high school graduates, programs that cannot receive proper attention while the office of the president irons out its ""bureaucratic problems.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It will be the students who suffer most for the drawn-out arguments among Wilson, the regents and Atkinson. And the problem couldn't be happening at a worse time. The regents have given the university an opportunity to fix a systematic race bias and replace it with a program that will reward underprivileged students of all races and place them on the road to success. What's now needed are leaders who will steer our university into the next millennium, not stall it in the fast lane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: MATT MAHURIN / for The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Matt Belloni, a junior majoring in political science and Spanish at UC Berkeley, is the opinion-page editor of the Daily Californian the independent student newspaper</p></div>"	2								2

The publisher called it ''a huge black eye.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could this happen at the most rigorously edited newspaper in the world? We had plenty of warning: his 50-plus corrections in less than four years as a reporter, his evasion of questions about his whereabouts, complaints from colleagues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apparently this 27-year-old was given too many second chances by editors eager for this ambitious black journalist to succeed. As he moved to more responsible assignments, some editors failed to pass along assessments of his past shortcomings while others felt the need to protect the confidentiality of his troubles. Result: the con artist gamed a system that celebrates diversity and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times's executive editor, Howell Raines, is determined to get right with readers by letting the ''terrible mistake'' be examined in excruciating detail. In addition to this opposite of cover-up, he assigned another newsroom group to come up with ways to prevent another failure of communication among our editors, the most expert of communicators.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's the reaction in Washington, where -- we now know -- the fraudulent reporter came down to stain The Times's coverage of last year's attacks by snipers?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals down here, who only last week had been gleeful at the revelation of conservative Bill Bennett's high-rolling gambling habit, are rendered glum by this embarrassment of the newspaper whose editorial policy they favor. But now my right-wing friends are suddenly up to their hips in their own Schadenfreude. (That's the German word for ''the guilty pleasure one secretly takes in another's suffering.'')</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the culture war. Some of my ideological soulmates say: See? There goes the prestigious New York Times, world paragon of accuracy, newspaper of record, winner of far more Pulitzer prizes than anybody -- suckered for years by one cunning kid. About time those snobby Eastern elitists, twisting the news to fit their prejudices, got their comeuppance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then to the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> angle: See what happens, they taunt, when you treat a minority employee with kid gloves, promoting him when he deserves to be fired? Oh, we know your editors insist that ''diversity'' had nothing to do with it. But remember what Senator Dale Bumpers said about our impeachment of Clinton: ''When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex' -- it's about sex.'' This is about diversity backfiring.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's my reply to their Kulturkampf: For exactly 30 years, I have been supported handsomely for disagreeing with The Times's editorial page, which is dovish on defense, leftist on economics and (with the exception of civil liberties) resolutely wrongheaded. Never have I been silenced, and conservative thinkers have an ever-fairer shake on the Op-Ed page.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for news coverage being influenced by editorial policy, I evoke the name of my predecessor: that's a Krock. On occasion, a leftist slant on a story slips through the backfield, but with conservatives boring from within and fulminating from without, the news side soon straightens itself out. What is ''fit to print'' is the truth as straight as we can tell it, which is why Times people are so furious at this galling breach.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now about the supposed cost of diversity: A newspaper is free to come down on the side of giving black journalists a break if its owners and editors so choose. What's more, this media world would also benefit from more Hispanics and Asians coming up faster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the 375 Times reporters who make up the greatest assemblage of talent and enterprise in the field of gathering and writing the news, I submit this hard line:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Self-examination is healthy but self-absorption is not; self-correction is a winner but self-flagellation is a sure loser. Let us slap a metaphoric cold steak over our huge black eye and learn from this dismaying example -- so that other journalists in the nation and around the world can continue to learn from ours.</p></div>"	2								2

This never gets easier.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced Wednesday that one police officer would be charged, not in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, but with endangering her neighbors with reckless gunfire. ""If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice,"" Mr. Cameron said, in an apparent attempt to explain the lack of more serious charges relating to the 26-year-old's killing. ""Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cameron's use of the term ""mob justice"" to characterize protests by African-Americans who want officers who kill Black people with seeming impunity held responsible for their actions is curious phrasing, particularly from an attorney general from a Southern state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mob justice was literally used by Kentucky and other Southern states for decades to rule over Black people. Lynching and other racial terror tactics were deployed frequently, often with the help of the criminal justice system. Authorities were known to hand Black people to mobs who turned violence and spectacle into regional events. The news of an impending lynching would bring Southern white families to town squares on foot and by wagon. They arrived with picnic lunches and cameras to watch live examples of the devaluation of Black citizenship and the snuffing out of life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Ben Tobin of the Louisville Courier-Journal, ""between 1877 and 1934, lynchings of at least 186 African Americans took place in KY."" This was mob justice. This represented repeated failures of the criminal justice system. This was a willful shunning of the nation's basic principles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All Ms. Taylor's family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we're so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it's not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. It's painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman's home late at night will face no consequences. Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years various media outlets have invited people to share stories about when they first realized they were Black. Often, the realizations came from some negative experience with racial prejudice: The time a white childhood friend couldn't invite them to a sleepover, or when a favorite high school teacher told them <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> would get them into a great college. We've frequently read and heard about the talks Black parents have with their children, explaining how racism can make people misconstrue their behavior, and about how teens must learn the etiquette of negotiating racial animus. Don't talk back. Look down. Say yes ma'am and yes sir.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what can prepare a person for the proper response to heavily armed cops in their home in the middle of the night? How could we have prepared Breonna Taylor? The answer is, we couldn't have. What could have prepared her family for the failure to hold the police officers in this case accountable? Nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have always known I was Black. I was raised in a segregated community, attended a racially segregated church, was bused across town to schools with more resources, watched ""Roots"" and ""Eyes on the Prize"" with my family and recited Margaret Walker poems in Black History Month programs. I was bathed in blackness from birth. I also knew fairly early on that not everyone viewed blackness through the same lens, and that I would be on the receiving end of racial hostility. I felt prepared for this eventuality. But when I was standing on High Street in front of Ohio State's campus and someone from a car full of white boys yelled a racial slur at me in broad daylight, with lots of people watching but not even acknowledging what happened, I learned there is never enough preparation. Not for the pugilistic ways that white supremacy can render you an afterthought of American democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That experience has stayed with me for over 20 years. The realization that no police officer will face consequences for killing Breonna Taylor will stay with me, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that the failure to indict a police officer for killing Ms. Taylor was unpredictable. It's that the emotional and political exhaustion surrounding the news was predictable. This is what inspires the rage and despair that Mr. Cameron cruelly and ahistorically dismissed as ""mob justice."" This is what forces Black people to push for this nation to be better stewards of its ideal, while recalibrating our expectations time and time again.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of ""The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

But the average Black man in America lives about five fewer years than the average white man. A newborn Black boy in Washington, D.C., has a shorter life expectancy than a newborn boy in India.One of the challenges for those of us in journalism is to do a better job highlighting these inequities that don't come with a viral video.Since Floyd's death, we've focused on racial inequities in the criminal justice system, and it has been easy for liberal white Americans -- my tribe -- to feel indignant and righteous while blaming others. But in some areas, such as an unjust education system, we are part of the problem.At the very time that America was having a racial reckoning about criminal justice, Democratic states were closing in-person schooling in ways that particularly harmed nonwhite students. Race gaps increased, according to research by McKinsey & Company, and a Federal Reserve study suggests that higher dropout rates for marginalized students will have long-term consequences.More broadly, we in the United States embrace a public education system based on local financing that ensures that poor kids go to poor schools and rich kids to rich schools.Yes, it's a ""public"" school system with ""free"" education. So anyone who can afford a typical home in Palo Alto, Calif., costing $3.2 million, can then send children to superb schools. And less than 2 percent of Palo Alto's population is Black.Rucker Johnson, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that since 1988, American public schools have become more racially segregated. Roughly 15 percent of Black and Hispanic students attend so-called apartheid schools with fewer than 1 percent white students.In 1973, the Supreme Court came a whisker from overturning this system of unequal school funding, in the case of Rodriguez v. San Antonio Independent School District. Lower courts had ruled that profoundly unequal school funding violated the Constitution, but by a 5-to-4 vote the justices disagreed.This was the Brown v. Board of Education case that went the other way. If a single justice had switched, America would today be a fairer and more equitable nation.Educated white Americans are now repulsed at the thought of systems of separate and unequal drinking fountains for Black Americans but seem comfortable with a Jim Crow financing system resulting in unequal schools for Black children -- even though schools are far more consequential than water fountains.Perhaps that's because we and our children have a stake in this unequal system. Similarly, we accept that elite universities offer legacy preferences that amount to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for highly privileged children, with bonus consideration for big donors. This is one reason some universities have more students from the richest 1 percent than from the poorest 60 percent.Likewise, wealthy white Americans benefit from single-family zoning laws in the suburbs around those fine ""public"" schools. The effect of this zoning is to freeze out low-income families and keep neighborhoods more segregated.Then there's our skewed tax system: The I.R.S. is more likely to audit impoverished Americans who use the earned-income tax credit and typically earn less than $20,000 than it is to audit people earning $400,000. The county in the United States with the highest audit rate, according to ProPublica, is Humphreys County, Miss., which is impoverished and three-quarters Black.So how do we address these root inequities?We don't have perfect solutions, but many programs promote opportunity and reduce race gaps over time. The time to start is early childhood, with home visiting, quality child care and pre-K. Baby bonds can reduce wealth gaps, and child tax credits cut child poverty. Job training and a higher minimum wage can help families. Many of these elements are in President Biden's three-part proposal to invest in America and Americans, with the goal of reducing child poverty in America by half.One paradox is that while liberals often advocate such measures as ways to reduce racial inequality, polling suggests that this framing actually reduces public support. The best way to win support for these progressive policies, research suggests, is to frame them as reducing class gaps, not race gaps.Back in the early 2000s, white Americans sometimes said in polls that antiwhite bias was a bigger problem than anti-Black bias. That was delusional, and the tumult following the Floyd case increased the share of whites who acknowledge that discrimination persists.So the Floyd case may represent a milestone of progress in criminal justice. Now can America leverage this recognition of unfairness and inequity into other spheres, such as our still segregated education system?The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

This is one reason some universities have more students from the richest 1 percent than from the poorest 60 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, wealthy white Americans benefit from single-family zoning laws in the suburbs around those fine ""public"" schools. The effect of this zoning is to freeze out low-income families and keep neighborhoods more segregated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's our skewed tax system: The I.R.S. is more likely to audit impoverished Americans who use the earned-income tax credit and typically earn less than $20,000 than it is to audit people earning $400,000. The county in the United States with the highest audit rate, according to ProPublica, is Humphreys County, Miss., which is impoverished and three-quarters Black.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how do we address these root inequities?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We don't have perfect solutions, but many programs promote opportunity and reduce race gaps over time. The time to start is early childhood, with home visiting, quality child care and pre-K. Baby bonds can reduce wealth gaps, and child tax credits cut child poverty. Job training and a higher minimum wage can help families. Many of these elements are in President Biden's three-part proposal to invest in America and Americans, with the goal of reducing child poverty in America by half.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One paradox is that while liberals often advocate such measures as ways to reduce racial inequality, polling suggests that this framing actually reduces public support. The best way to win support for these progressive policies, research suggests, is to frame them as reducing class gaps, not race gaps.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in the early 2000s, white Americans sometimes said in polls that antiwhite bias was a bigger problem than anti-Black bias. That was delusional, and the tumult following the Floyd case increased the share of whites who acknowledge that discrimination persists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So the Floyd case may represent a milestone of progress in criminal justice. Now can America leverage this recognition of unfairness and inequity into other spheres, such as our still segregated education system?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

A century after Finley Peter Dunne's fictional Irish saloonkeeper made the point, the court has put an interesting spin on Mr. Dooley's theory. At a time when President Bush and his Republican majority in Congress are continually arguing that they have the mandate to appoint extreme conservatives to the federal bench, the highest court of all has surprised many people with its moderation. The Supreme Court, it appears, is better at reading the election returns than some elected politicians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservative legal groups had high hopes that the nine justices -- seven of whom were appointed by Republican presidents -- would issue a landmark ruling this term striking down <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joining the court's most liberal members in a 5-to-4 vote, upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions. By endorsing the consideration of race, but barring quotas and rigid formulas, the court essentially ratified an existing national consensus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the term's other blockbuster decision, the court ruled 6 to 3 that gay sexual relations are constitutionally protected. In doing so, it erased one of its own worst precedents, the 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, and struck an important blow for gay rights generally. And it brought the law in line with evolving popular opinion, which now solidly holds that private consensual sex should be legal, and that gays should not be subject to discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court surprised the legal community by halting, or at least pausing in, its aggressive states' rights crusade. Until this term the conservative majority, led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, had been steadily whittling away at Americans' rights under federal law. It struck down the Violence Against Women Act on ''federalism'' grounds, and held that the nation's 4.8 million state employees are only partly protected by federal disability and age discrimination laws. But this term the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, rejected a federalism claim and held that state workers are fully protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the court's inclination to stick to the mainstream meant it did an uneven job of protecting the marginalized from the excesses of the majority. The court callously turned away a challenge to California's ''three strikes'' law by a man who was given a sentence of 50 years to life for stealing $150 worth of videotapes from Kmart. Justice O'Connor, whose status as the court's critical swing vote was solidified this year, provided the majority with its fifth vote in that case. But she was also the swing vote to uphold Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, a vital source of funds for legal services for the poor nationwide that was challenged by conservative legal groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This term showed just how far right the court's three most conservative members are. The dissent in the gay sex case -- by the chief justice, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- fulminated, like a talk show rant, about a ''homosexual agenda.'' But there is no equivalent core of justices on the left trying to push beyond the legal expression of mainstream American thought. No justice wrote separately to say the principles the court laid down offer support for gay marriage. On subjects from civil rights to criminal law, the ideological spectrum ranges from the far right on one side to liberal centrism on the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final week of the session, when the decisions on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and the sodomy law came down, are sure to energize right-wing activists, who were already upset with the court's moderation and vowing to fill the next vacancy with another Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas. An extreme choice for a single slot could have a profound impact on American life -- limiting the ability of the federal government to protect the environment, and ending <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and, perhaps, abortion rights. The court's performance over the last nine months was not perfect, but it generally reflected the best instincts of the American people. The Senate, and public, must not allow this to change.</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2099964529.xml.txt	"<div><p>Brett Kavanaugh likened Supreme Court justices to 'umpires.' That's nonsense and he knows it</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again a Supreme Court nominee has insulted the intelligence of the American public by likening justices to “umpires.” Echoing the language used by John Roberts at his confirmation hearings in 2005, Brett Kavanaugh declared Tuesday before the Senate: “A good judge must be an umpire — a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.… I don’t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But justices are not umpires at all. Umpires apply rules and have little leeway in determining how those rules should be interpreted. The Supreme Court creates the rules and justices have enormous discretion how to interpret the law. By likening himself to an umpire, Kavanaugh was contending that his views don’t matter at all. That is false.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How a justice votes is very much a result of his or her ideology and views. Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor disagree in virtually every major case entirely because of their differing ideologies. This is not new; Supreme Court decisions have always been a product of those sitting on the bench.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Constitution was written ­— intentionally — in broad, open-ended language that rarely provides guidance for issues that must be resolved by the Supreme Court. Justices are obligated to give meaning to ambiguous words written almost 230 years ago. What is “speech”? For example, should spending money in an election campaign be regarded as a form of speech? This is the issue at the heart of whether campaign spending limits violate the 1st Amendment. The text of the Constitution cannot answer the question of whether spending money is speech. Nor did the founders think about this in 1789, when campaign spending did not exist as it does today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the most controversial parts of the Constitution, the 2nd Amendment reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Is this a right to have guns only for militia service or does it create a more general right of individuals to possess firearms? On this question, the court split 5-4 exactly along ideological lines in District of Columbia vs. Heller in 2008 and declared unconstitutional a 32-year-old ordinance prohibiting ownership or possession of handguns. The conservative majority chose to read the 2nd Amendment as a right of individuals to possess handguns in their homes for the sake of security, while the liberals argued that the 2nd Amendment is a right to have guns solely for the purpose of militia service. Either is a plausible reading of the text supportable by the amendment’s history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No constitutional right is absolute and constitutional cases constantly involve balancing of the government’s interest against the claim of a right. A justice’s own ideology and life experiences inevitably determine how he or she strikes the balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To pick an easy example, the 4th Amendment prohibits “unreasonable” searches and arrests. But what is reasonable or unreasonable cannot be answered from the text of the Constitution or any original understanding. When the court considered whether the police can take a DNA sample from a person arrested for a serious crime to see if it matches DNA from an unsolved crime in a police database, the court explicitly balanced the benefit to law enforcement of obtaining the information against the intrusion to privacy and ruled, 5-4, in favor of the government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under constitutional law, the court frequently weighs whether the government has a “compelling” or “important” or a “legitimate” interest. For example, in cases involving <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, the central question is whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. In deciding the constitutionality of laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, the court had to decide, at a minimum, whether they serve a legitimate interest. But whether something is a “compelling” or an “important” or a “legitimate” government interest demands a value choice. It never can be answered by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump, senators and the public all know that justices are not like umpires, which is exactly why the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees are so contentious. Kavanaugh obviously knows this, too, and should not have presented such a misleading sense of constitutional law to the Senate Judiciary Committee or the American public.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Erwin Chemerinsky is dean and Jesse H.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/424890519.xml.txt	<div><p>ABROAD AT HOME; AFTER ANDROPOV</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is going to be a political year now for both the United States and the Soviet Union. In their different ways the two societies will be preoccupied by the dynamics of internal power. Any attempt by the two Governments to do business with each other will be conditioned on those twin realities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new Soviet leader will no doubt be cautious as he builds support. And he will share the general Russian view of Ronald Reagan as the most hostile American President in memory. He will have little incentive in foreign policy to take steps that would help Mr. Reagan win re-election - not, at least, unless and until Mr. Reagan looks a sure winner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The death of Yuri Andropov, in short, makes it even less likely that there can be any resolution this year of the major issues that divide the two superpowers. Indeed, meaningful negotiation on matters of substance is a remote prospect.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Must we, then, resign ourselves to Soviet-American relations continuing for the rest of this year at their present icy level, with hardly any communication between the dominant powers on earth? Is there nothing that can be suggested by way of hope?  No, it seems to me that there are some realistic possibilities in this political year. They are modest, as they must be in the circumstances. But they might open the way for efforts to work out the larger issues, most urgently arms control, next year.  One negative principle is important. This is not a time - if there ever is a time - when either side should undertake to put the other to a test.  At a minimum the two countries do not want the tensions between them to become more dangerous. In a period of political sensitivity, that means the Russians should avoid new geographical thrusts or provocations. It would be just as dangerous for the United States to take steps that look like deliberate challenges to the Soviet Union.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the affirmative possibility of signals: actions that may not themselves constitute a change in international policy but that suggest a desire to do diplomatic business. Here I think the crucial need now is for each side to signal a degree of respect for the other's concerns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Soviet side, one human gesture would have a great effect on opinion in America and elsewhere in the West. That is to ease up on the repression of dissidents. The potent symbolic step would be to release the three most prominent victims of the repression: Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Shcharansky.  Andrei Sakharov, the great physicist exiled to Gorky and harassed there by the K.G.B., wrote a letter to scientific colleagues in the Soviet Union and abroad that is published in the current New York Review of Books. It is a heart-rending document.  The Sakharov letter appeals for help in getting the Soviet authorities to let his wife, Elena Bonner, go abroad for medical treatment. She has had several heart attacks and has no way of getting proper care. In a further message dated Jan. 12, Mr. Sakharov said: ''Only a trip to receive medical treatment abroad can save her life, and mine as well, since her death would mean my death.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yuri Orlov, another physicist, was arrested seven years ago for setting up a committee to monitor Soviet compliance with the Helsinki agreements. He has reportedly been treated with special harshness in a labor camp at Perm. He was due for release from there this past Friday - but some experts fear that his term will be extended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anatoly Shcharansky, an activist in both the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, has been in prison in Chistopol for nearly six years now. His mother saw him on Jan. 5 and said he was in severe pain from a heart condition and so emaciated that he was ''unrecognizable.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soviet leaders evidently do not understand what a terrible impact such cases have in the West - have specifically on the possibilities for negotiation. But there is an American failure of understanding, too. That is President Reagan's inability, if it is that, to appreciate the effect he creates in the Soviet Union by his bellicose and insulting rhetoric.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Malcolm Toon, U.S. Ambassador in Moscow from 1976 to 1979, is known for taking a tough line toward the Soviets. But when I talked with him after Mr. Andropov's death, he said essential business cannot be done with them if American rhetoric makes them think our aim is their destruction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''For us as concerned Americans,'' Mr. Toon said, ''the important question is which is the real Reagan: the guy who made the awful 'evil empire' speech in Orlando? Or the one who made the speech in the White House last month, helpful but long overdue?  Frankly, I don't know which. And I think the Russians are confused - they don't really know if he's out to do them in.''</p></div>			3					6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/420557855.xml.txt	"<div><p>2 more years of endless campaigning; The length of election cycles tests voters' patience, but it also tests candidates' mettle</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>in Britain, Canada and other civilized places, national elections are often called, run and concluded within six weeks. In America, election campaigns go on forever. It used to be one year, now it's two. No one planned this, but like other evolutionary artifacts (the  founders applied intelligent design to the general makeup of the U.S. government but never foresaw formal political parties, let alone the endless campaign), this crazy improvisation embodies a certain wisdom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, it tests a certain kind of competence. Managing a national campaign in a country of continental dimensions requires exceptional organizational skills. A fairly narrow competence, to be sure, but of major importance in a country where the president must run the behemoth that is the federal government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second function of the endless campaign is to build party consensus and democratic legitimacy, both of which contribute substantially to the astonishing stability and longevity of the American system. The presidential primary season is essentially a prolonged intraparty dialogue. It recreates the Madisonian idea of factions and interests competing against each other, applied not to the legislature or the executive, but to the electoral process that produces both. The job of the parties is to create a kind of prelegislative consensus through the competition and conversation of the various factions -- ethnic, ideological, economic, geographic. The purpose of the endless presidential primary is to force the dialogue and, for all its haphazard meanderings and maddening trivialities, it does.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unscripted, of course, and much of it goes nowhere. But not always. Perhaps Barack Obama's suggestion during a television interview that we should be moving away from preferences based on race to preferences based on class will be ignored, but perhaps it will be taken up by an opponent or the media and provoke a historic debate within the Democratic Party on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and a transition to a new national consensus.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, Rudy Giuliani wrestles with the abortion issue (and, in the eyes of many, loses). He will be asked the question repeatedly. He will have to answer repeatedly. Should he prevail as the GOP presidential nominee, it will perhaps represent a historic shift in the very self-definition of American conservatism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. Nothing is guaranteed, but we do have the striking example of welfare reform, the most significant social advance of our time. Its political origin was the first presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, who distinguished himself from the field as a New Democrat by pledging to end welfare as we know it -- thus giving him the legitimacy within the Democratic Party to carry out so radical a reform. When serendipity presented him with the Republican Congress committed to the same objective, the reform got done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The final function of the endless campaign, and perhaps the most psychologically important, is to satisfy the American instinct for egalitarianism. We have turned the presidential campaign into a pleasingly degrading ordeal -- pleasing, that is, to the electorate. The modern presidential campaign is meant to be physically exhausting and spiritually humbling almost to the point of humiliation. Candidates spend two years and more on bended knee begging for money, votes and a handshake in a diner.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why do we inflict such cruel and unusual punishment? Because our winner is not just chief magistrate but king. True, the kingship is temporary, but its glories and perks are beyond compare -- the pomp and pampering of a head of state, married to the real political power of controlling the most important state on the planet.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bargain we offer the candidate is this: We will make you Lord, circling celestially above us on Air Force One, but because we are flinty Jeffersonian yeomen, we insist that you flatter us first with a very extended show of camaraderie and commonality with the Iowa farmer, the New Hampshire alderman and the South Carolina good ol' boy. Aboriginal tribes have slightly different rituals for those who pretend to kingship, but the idea is the same: ordeal before dominion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a columnist whose job it is to chart every jot and tittle of these campaigns, every teapot tempest that history will remember for not one second, I curse election years. Now, I have to curse the year before as well. But for all its bizarre meanderings, the endless campaign serves critical purposes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first two -- testing the candidates' managerial and consensus-building skills -- are undeniably useful. But like most Americans, I find it is the third -- the gratuitous humiliation of our would-be kings -- that makes it all worthwhile.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---------- Charles Krauthammer is a syndicated columnist based in Washington.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398299761.xml.txt	"<div><p>Blacks and Whites on Common Ground</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty-eight years after the Civil Rights Act, racial polarization continues to frustrate consensus on some of the most important issues facing our nation. But recent survey findings may foster mutual understanding by debunking one of the most pernicious myths underlying racial division: that blacks and whites have fundamentally different views and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This myth has fueled demagogues on both sides of the racial divide, especially in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. But poll results just released by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political Studies reveal that most blacks aspire like other Americans to safe streets, good schools and home ownership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of equal import, the survey demonstrates that mainstream black Americans are far more conservative than most of the politicians and organizations that purport to speak for them. This philosophical gulf perhaps was most pronounced near the end of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, when national groups like the NAACP stridently opposed the Supreme Court nominee while blacks in general approved by a three-to-one ratio (along with some local NAACP chapters).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center study found that more blacks label themselves conservative (33%) than either liberal (28%) or moderate (31%). Young blacks 18 to 34 years old are more conservative, with 38% describing themselves as such.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But conservative blacks have not yet found a hospitable political home. A minuscule 5% of those surveyed are Republicans. The GOP's failure to attract like-minded blacks offers vivid testimony to years of hostility or neglect by Republicans toward matters of concern to black Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Poll findings on specific issues highlight common ground between whites and blacks. Despite opposition by establishment civil rights groups to capital punishment as racially discriminatory, the survey found most blacks favor the death penalty. This finding reflects serious concern about crime. More than half the blacks surveyed live within a few blocks of places they're afraid to walk in at night, and nearly half live in neighborhoods where young men carry guns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Education is the number one election issue for black Americans, the survey found, and 75% support a ""back-to-basics"" direction. In sharp contrast to politicians and establishment civil rights leaders, an amazing 88% support a ""voucher"" system that would allow parents to choose the schools their children attend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many other Americans, most blacks are skeptical about current welfare policies. Some 57% believe government should not increase aid when single mothers have more children, and 75% think such a policy change would encourage single women to have fewer children. The poll found 91% of blacks support opportunities for low-income people to become homeowners by buying their public housing, a centerpiece of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp's ""empowerment"" agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center poll echoes an earlier survey by Linda Lichter, which found a gulf over major issues between leaders of black organizations and randomly selected blacks. The survey found 77% of black leaders believed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should be the most important factor in hiring and education decisions; indeed, National Urban League President John Jacob called this ""the one constant that must be shared by anyone who presumes to hold a leadership position in the black community."" But the survey found most blacks would flunk this ideological litmus test. Some 77% believe ability rather than race should be the determining factor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, the Lichter survey found 68% of black leaders favoring forced busing for integration, while 53% of mainstream blacks opposed busing. Two-thirds of black leaders opposed the death penalty for murder, compared with 55% of all blacks who favored it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings contain powerful messages for both sides of the policy debate. They explain why liberal groups like the NAACP have lost thousands of members in recent years, particularly among younger blacks. By focusing on social engineering schemes such as racial quotas and set-asides that have little relevance to the real problems facing many blacks, the civil rights leadership elite is growing increasingly out of touch with its constituency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this regard, the leadership elite's problems are twofold. Racial preferences don't much aid a black underclass beset with ravaging crime, economic stagnation and inadequate schools. Likewise, the growing number of blacks who have joined the economic mainstream may have more in common with other middle class Americans than with those whose agenda remains rooted in the battles of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For conservatives, opportunities are apparent. But instead of partisan efforts, they should concentrate on specific issues in which common cause exists with mainstream blacks. Groups such as the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and the Institute for Justice have built potent coalitions with low-income people on such empowerment issues as school choice, tenant management of public housing, and challenges to regulatory barriers to entry-level entrepreneurial opportunities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only by default, Bill Clinton likely will win the majority of black votes this November, and he mouthed the rhetoric of empowerment at the Democratic National Convention. But to the extent he caves into special interest groups -- he promised teachers unions he'd oppose school choice that includes private schools -- it could create openings for George Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush has fumbled on the race issue, capitulating on a divisive civil rights bill that means little to most blacks while failing to forcefully articulate a positive alternative. Mr. Bush needs to take his case directly to black Americans, presenting a clear agenda to create tangible opportunities for upward mobility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus far he has not done so. Bush proposals on urban enterprise zones, tenant management, school choice and tax relief are pitched separately and dispassionately, rather than as a comprehensive package the Democrats can't match. The administration some time ago banished the ""E"" word -- empowerment -- from its official lexicon to keep Jack Kemp's star from shining too brightly. So long as it lacks a credible vision and messenger, the GOP richly deserves cynicism from blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regardless of its political or policy implications, the survey's most significant impact is to undermine the stereotype that all blacks think alike -- a stereotype perpetuated by establishment civil rights groups who punish those who dissent from establishment orthodoxy. Federal Appeals Court Judge Leon Higginbotham, for instance, recently scolded Justice Thomas in print for supposedly betraying his race by committing various perceived philosophical heresies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it was the Thomas nomination itself that disproved this patronizing stereotype once and for all. For Justice Thomas personifies the American Dream of achievement based on merit and hard work. His rise from poverty and segregation marked a vindication of the ideas of equality and opportunity -- ideals to which blacks and whites alike are committed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Martin Luther King Jr. was perhaps the last civil rights leader to understand that. Instead of emphasizing differences among people the way contemporary civil rights leaders often do, he drew constantly upon the principles and aspirations that unite us as Americans, black and white, rich and poor. Indeed, the remaining task of the civil rights struggle is not to redistribute opportunities through a divisive and counterproductive racial spoils system, but to empower those who have been denied opportunities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is on the basis of these traditional American ideas that the problems facing the most disadvantaged members of our society can be surmounted -- and the sometimes seemingly insurmountable chasm between blacks and whites can be bridged.    ---    Mr. Bolick is litigation director at the Institute for Justice in Washington and author of ""Unfinished Business: A Civil Rights Strategy for America's Third Century"" (Pacific Research Institute, 1990).</p></div>"	2								2

But right now Bradley should not distract attention from Al Gore, whose difficulties multiply. And Bradley's recent foray into the politics of ideas did not make sensible people impatient for his next foray.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore knows that serving vice presidents who have wanted their parties' nominations have succeeded recently (Nixon in 1960, Humphrey in 1968, Bush in 1988). However, Bush in 1988 was the first incumbent vice president since Van Buren in 1836 to win the presidency. Bush won partly because a contented electorate wanted the closest thing to a third Reagan term. Not many voters next year are going to be thinking, ""Gosh, it would be really neat to prolong the Clinton years!""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats worry about polls that show George W. Bush, about whom voters know little, handily beating Gore in places like Michigan. This in the record 97th month of peacetime economic expansion. And Gore keeps saying strange things. Never mind his I-was-a- hardscrabble-farmer and his I-invented-the-Internet riffs. Consider two recent beauties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pressed by some environmentalists to support aggressive measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and coal-burning power plants, Gore responded that he's on their side, but challenged them: ""Name a senator who would support me."" Does it occur to him that there might be something wrong with an agenda opposed by 100 senators?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recently Gore, speaking of his book ""Earth in the Balance,"" told Time magazine: ""There's not a statement in that book that I don't endorse. Not one. The evidence has firmed up the positions I sketched there."" Oh? What fresh evidence confirms that ours is a ""dysfunctional civilization""? Or that automobiles pose ""a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again likely to confront""? Should we then be bombing Detroit instead of Serbia?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The certitude that Gore radiates carries an undercurrent of moral preening -- the suggestion that people who come to different conclusions are morally as well as intellectually flawed. On the evidence of Bradley's recent speech on race, he can match Gore stride for stride in the sanctimony sweepstakes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's speech at Cooper Union in Manhattan was long on earnestness. We all should ""look deeper into the soul of America"" and pursue ""racial healing"" which is thwarted by ""white indifference and black suspicion"" and ""the deadwood of superstition, fear and fantasy."" Many white Americans ""harbor absurd stereotypes about all people of color."" We need ""candid talk."" And so on.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is familiar. On July 10, 1991, in a remarkably unpleasant ""open letter"" to President Bush, Bradley accused Bush of hypocrisy and of ""shamelessly"" engaging in ""race-baiting."" On July 16, 1991, Bradley implicitly praised himself for ""speaking candidly"" and for the ""moral courage"" to avoid ""easy evasions"" about race by faulting others for not speaking as he does. His ""candid talk"" included falsely accusing Ronald Reagan of saying that ""all female black Americans are welfare queens.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He even left the impression that the surge of murders among young blacks after 1984 was the result of Republican presidents, not crack cocaine. On April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots following the initial acquittal of the police in the Rodney King case, Bradley again described America as ""a society that does not talk honestly about race.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley's belief that Americans are not sufficiently and properly preoccupied with race may resonate among Democratic activists. Many of them endorse identity politics, the theory that individuals are decisively shaped and irrevocably defined not by reasoned choices but by accidents of birth and socialization -- by membership in a racial, ethnic or sexual group.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, it is arguable that identity politics, and obsessing about race, is a plague. Bradley wants to ""overcome our divisions"" and ""get to a time when, in Toni Morrison's words, `race exists, but it doesn't matter.' "" But his self-advertised candor does not extend to even considering the possibility that reaching such a time is made more difficult by some things Democrats cherish -- <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, categorical representation (the theory that the interests of a group can only be understood and represented by members of that group) and the rest of the racial spoils system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bradley cannot hope -- who can? -- to beat Gore in the sanctimony sweepstakes. So he should avoid implying that America's failure to measure up to his standard of racial honesty results not from honest differences of opinions among decent people, but from the moral inadequacies of those who do not share his opinions.</p></div>"	2								2

By offering an alarmist interpretation of the fact that blacks as a group score 15 points lower than whites in I.Q. tests, the book's authors are, in their words, bravely tackling ""a taboo issue"" or, as their critics have it, recklessly fanning the flames of racial division in a nation already at the brink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But isn't it also possible that a publisher is simply hawking a book?  The incendiary ""science"" in ""The Bell Curve"" is not new; its policy prescriptions are conservative boilerplate. Had the authors compared the I.Q. scores of men and women, that might have been a cry of ""Fire!"" in a societal tinderbox. As ""The Bell Curve"" stands, however, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein might be more accurately charged with rehashing the work of others (and sometimes their own) for financial and political profit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of those others is William Shockley, a memorable nut who argued a quarter-century ago in favor of sterilizing those with low I.Q.'s.  Shockley receives only one guarded paragraph in the 845 pages of ""The Bell Curve."" Yet his old pronouncements are everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shockley attributed the lower income and higher crime rates of blacks to the same 15-point I.Q. test differential. He concluded that ""a major cause of American Negroes' intellectual and social deficit is hereditary and racially genetic"" and ""not remediable to a major degree by practical improvement in environment."" He bemoaned welfare for encouraging the procreation of the population's ""least effective elements,"" black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more elegantly written ""Bell Curve"" has the same drift. Shockley bequeathed its authors their self-congratulatory tone as well: He boasted about raising ""questions that are usually swept under the rug"" as they do about breaking taboos. Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein also emulate Shockley by asserting expertise in academic disciplines (like genetics) outside their own and by protesting too much against those who might accuse them of making a fetish of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the ""Bell Curve"" authors cannot add to the science and pseudo-science they selectively cull from their primary sources, they update Shockley's politics for the 1990's (<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should be abolished along with welfare) and tack on apocalyptic predictions of the sort found in best sellers heralding the next economic crash. ""The Bell Curve"" imagines a polarized, totalitarian Futureworld where the I.Q. elite will confine the dumb poor to a high-tech ""Indian reservation."" And how could this be prevented? Rather than provide answers requiring original thought, the authors fade off into a nostalgic paean to old-fashioned, self-governing neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone looking for fresh, specific ideas about overhauling welfare -- and who isn't? -- will not find them in ""The Bell Curve."" Instead there is padding: enough equivocating disclaimers for another ""Hamlet,"" and a mother lode of graphs designed to lend the book an air of unimpeachable authority, much as all those radar maps impart meteorological gravity to Willard Scott.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the authors concede their bell curves can be ignored. Lest they lose a single low-I.Q. customer, they announce in a revealingly caste-obsessed preface that their book is ""only about 30 pages long"" if read ""at the simplest level,"" since there are italicized Cliffs Notes throughout. The graph-packed main text is ""accessible to anyone who enjoys reading, for example, the science section of the news magazines,"" but the appendices that follow are suitable for only the very smartest -- no doubt the Asians who perform highest on I.Q. tests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such clever merchandising may make ""The Bell Curve"" the best-selling unread book since the last novel by Umberto Eco. Then again, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein may have outsmarted themselves. A book that blames low I.Q.'s for what ails America may have tough sledding in a culture where even conservatives have been rushing to deify the 75 I.Q. of Forrest Gump.</p></div>"	2			4

And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a thousand times [and] remarked that he -- her father, my papaw -- had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do. ... Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, trying to explain why she identified herself as a ""minority"" law professor in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IT happens in a lot of American families. My maternal great-grandfather was born on a Maine island in the 1880s, in the days when Penobscot Indians still rode birch-bark canoes from their inland reservation to the coast for their annual clambake. I always had the definite idea that he had Indian blood himself -- maybe Penobscot, maybe Abenaki, maybe another New England tribe. In the photographs I have of him, he certainly looks the part, with a profile suited for an Indian Head penny.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My great-grandfather left an autobiography behind, though (that's how I know about the canoes and the clambake), and I went back to it recently and couldn't find even a hint of an Indian connection: just a typical old New England genealogy, mostly English families with some Irish woven in. This would have been immensely disappointing to my 10-year-old self, since I can remember telling friends in American history class, with an air of authority, that I was almost certainly one sixteenth Native American, or at the very least one thirty-second.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems that Elizabeth Warren may turn out to be similarly disappointed, after the New England Genealogical Society acknowledged last week that there's no firm evidence of her great-great-grandmother being Cherokee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That supposed ancestral tie was what inspired the professor-turned-Senate candidate to identify as an ethnic minority in law school directories early in her career. More important, it was what inspired The Harvard Crimson to refer to Warren as Harvard Law School's ""one tenured minority woman"" and The Fordham Law Review to cite her as Harvard Law's ""first woman of color"" during the mid-1990s debates over faculty diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that same claim -- and her clumsy, ""my grandfather had high cheekbones"" attempts to defend it -- has become perhaps the biggest obstacle in her quest to reclaim Ted Kennedy's Senate seat for liberalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole story has a tragicomic, Nathaniel Hawthorne meets ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" feel. It's easy to imagine Warren originally checking a box more on a whim than out of any deep determination to self-identify as Cherokee. (She didn't use the minority-applicant program when applying to Rutgers, where she attended law school, and she identified as ""white"" during an early teaching job at the University of Texas.) Then it's easy to imagine her embarrassment when the diversity wars of the 1990s made that whimsical choice something from which she couldn't dissociate herself without intense public awkwardness. Those wars faded, she no longer listed herself as a Native American, she thought the whole thing was behind her ... until she went into politics, where no secret stays buried.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The appropriate response to such a tale is probably sympathy rather than scorn. What does deserve scorn, though, is the academic culture in which an extremely distant connection to a Cherokee ancestor ends up being touted by a law school as proof of its commitment to diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diverse faculty and campus can be a laudable goal. But the point is to build academic communities that actually contain a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, not to wax self-congratulatory because you've met a set of ethnic quotas. The story of Elizabeth Warren, ""woman of color,"" represents a reductio ad absurdum of the latter tendency, which has been all too prevalent in elite universities -- giving us <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs that benefit West Indian immigrants more than the descendants of slaves, and faculties that include a wider range of skin tones than of political and religious views.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The irony is that Warren herself probably did make Harvard more diverse, since she grew up the daughter of a janitor in Oklahoma -- not a typical background, to put it mildly, for Ivy League students and faculty today. But under the academy's cramped definitions, it was her grandfather's Cherokee cheekbones, not her blue-collar roots, that led to her citation as a supposed trailblazer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't a serious approach to academic diversity, and in an emerging majority-minority America (already visible in the latest Census birth statistics) where almost everyone will be 1/8 something-or-other, it will be an increasingly untenable one as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many colleges and universities, then, this contretemps represents a timely gift: a chance to think anew about these issues, before the pursuit of a cosmetic diversity leaves them looking as ridiculous as poor Elizabeth Warren does today.</p></div>"	2								2

But personal relationships and an atmosphere of civility have clearly eroded.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As I prepare for other pursuits after 24 years as a state legislator, I have reflected upon the changes that have occurred in the state Capitol. Some have been good but others do not bode well as California's policy choices become more difficult and contentious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the positive side, the public is more involved in influencing state policy today than when I started. The Internet makes legislative documents available for free. Cable television broadcasts live floor and committee sessions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, the Legislature better reflects the diversity of California. When I first came to Sacramento, there were only two women and six Hispanic members among the 120 legislators; now 26 women and 20 Hispanic members serve in the Capitol, and the numbers are growing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One area that has not changed for the better is the personal relationships among legislators. This decline makes the job less enjoyable and makes it more difficult to agree on public policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When I first came to Sacramento, legislators worked together by day and socialized by night. Sometimes we argued, but it was always done respectfully. I was friends with rural, conservative Republicans and they were friends with me, a liberal Democrat from Los Angeles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I would umpire softball games between the Senate and Assembly (I admit I threw a few calls to the more ""mature"" and ""deliberative"" Senate players.) Legislators would get together at the Derby Club, a lunch organization established in 1953. The club has a strict rule prohibiting discussion of legislative business so people can to know each other as human beings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Frank Fat's, a 60-year-old Chinese restaurant three blocks from the Capitol building, often was filled with legislators sharing a meal or drink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today the atmosphere has changed. Years go by without a softball game. The Derby Club is ebbing because younger legislators have shown little interest in attending a weekly lunch. I see fewer legislators hanging out at Fat's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasingly, members of the Legislature do not take the time to get to know one another on a personal level. Socializing with a member of the opposite party is almost considered an act of treason among some newer, more partisan members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The respectful courtesy that opponents once extended during floor debates has given way to petty bickering, personal insults and simplistic bombast.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several factors have contributed to the change. Public discourse generally has become more crass, corroded by television sound bites, shrill talk-radio hosts and candidates promising easy fixes to complex problems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Term limits have short-circuited the ability of legislators to develop relationships that will last beyond the next election. An increased number of competitive legislative districts has raised the political stakes as each party vies for control of the two houses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whatever the reasons, the erosion of personal relationships hurts the Legislature's ability to deal with the difficult issues ahead.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my view, the deterioration of relationships in the Legislature contributed to the disturbing racial undertones of recent ballot measures concerning <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, bilingual education and illegal immigration. It was heartbreaking to see legislators from differing cultural or racial backgrounds debate these issues with an utter lack of sensitivity or understanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politics has never been an avocation for the meek. It attracts people with healthy egos and strong opinions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under these conditions, it is essential for legislators to get to know one another personally, off hours, to discuss nonlegislative matters. Learn about families, hobbies and upbringing. Discover hopes and motivations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the most diverse society in human history and the most complicated state in the nation, California needs legislators who will work hard at developing harmony.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good place to start is at lunch.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: Herschel Rosenthal</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Herschel Rosenthal is a Democrat who has represented portions of the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles</p></div>"	2							6

Amid a campaign-contributions maelstrom, they name a person -- the director of the White House Office of Public Liaison -- who is almost certainly at or near the eye of the storm (yes, we know, she was oblivious to it all, never came in contact, etc.). Now comes evidence of the rankest sort of quota-mongering by the person nominated to head one of the nation's most work-force-sensitive offices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House tells us that the chart below was part of a larger memo created for and ""in consultation with"" a working group headed by Ms. Herman during her White House tenure. The memo is titled ""Proposal to Enhance Administration Outreach to the African-American Community in 1996."" Its existence was first reported by two weeklies, the Forward and Human Events.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, it is obviously appropriate for the White House to reach out to the African-American community, and aggressively, in a Presidential campaign. What is striking about this chart is the programmatic mind-set it displays. Indeed, the chart is of a piece with the very same sort of document that in August laid out specific quota assignments for delegates to the Democratic convention -- ""adopt and implement <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs with specific goals and timetables for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans and women"" (Review & Outlook, ""The Quota Convention,"" 8/26/96).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exculpatory response to all this might be that the Democrats' internal political arrangements are their own business. We agree. The more compelling image to emerge from these practices, however, is that of a party in thrall to its constituent factions' demands, no matter what moderate rhetoric is put out for broader public consumption. Indeed, it was widely reported that Mr. Clinton was under enormous post-election pressure in naming his Cabinet from ""women"" and ""labor"" and ""minorities.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet once Ms. Herman is Secretary Herman we're supposed to believe that all this Democratic reality goes away, that the operative theory is ""mend it, don't end it,"" and that in its formal submissions to the Labor Department Texaco won't have to produce a chart just like the one Alexis Herman generated for the Clinton-Gore campaign.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As cases like Texaco's show, the 1990s are turning out to be the decade in which our national controversy over race moves beyond the academy to reside in the corporation. Along with the EEOC, the Labor Department is at center stage. Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regularly polices most Fortune 500 companies on their <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> practices; through the federal contract connection, Labor has the power to regulate more than half of the economy. Precisely for these reasons, the Labor Secretary's job should go to someone with great judgment and sensitivity, two traits not obviously in evidence in this nominee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p></div>"		1							2

Focusing only on racism will deflect attention from the economic problems poor people of color face.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the president says he wants to lead Americans ""in a great and unprecedented conversation about race,"" it appears his primary goal is to marshal support for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> ""has given us a whole new generation of professionals in fields that used to be exclusive clubs,"" Clinton said in announcing his initiative. ""There are more African American, Latino and Asian American lawyers and judges, scientists and engineers, accountants and executives than ever before.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs have opened the way for more people of color to join the middle class, and that is a good thing. But such programs have done little for people of color who are members of the working and poverty classes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, the successes of middle- and upper-class people of color can benefit poor people of color in indirect ways, like providing positive role models and weakening negative racial stereotypes. Furthermore, because middle-class people of color still face many disadvantages (bigotry, racially biased standardized tests, etc.) when competing against middle-class whites, some form of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is still needed. But the experience of the past three decades has shown that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs are no substitute for measures that would more directly address the effects of racism on poor people of color. In part, it is a story of how civil-rights organizations were co-opted into losing their focus on helping poor people.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act concluded the struggle for political and legal rights, civil rights leaders searched for new strategies to continue their struggle against racism. During the Mississippi March Against Fear in 1966, Willie Ricks, a staff member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, discovered the powerful resonance of the phrase ""black power"" when delivering a speech. He told SNCC chairman Stokely Carmichael, who brought the term into popular consciousness at subsequent rallies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what was ""black power""? Carmichael first defined it as black participation in politics to elect representatives more responsive to their needs. Later, he would identify American blacks as an exploited colony of the United States and attempt to link their struggle to the national liberation movements that flourished throughout the Third World after WWII.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the last word on the subject would not belong to Carmichael. In 1967, corporate interests, led by the Ford Foundation, became deeply involved in financing almost all major civil rights organizations. The co-optation of these organizations and the corporate-financed black-power conferences of 1967 and 1968 were instrumental in redefining ""black power"" as black capitalism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The equation of ""black power"" with black capitalism forestalled the possibility of class-based black-liberation struggles and quickly gained the endorsement of corporate and government leaders. In a 1968 radio broadcast, President Richard M. Nixon expressed his approval of ""black power, in the best, the constructive sense of that often misapplied term . . . It's no longer enough that white-owned enterprises employ greater number of Negroes, whether as laborers or as middle-management personnel. This is needed, yes--but it has to be accompanied by an expansion of black ownership, of black capitalism.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The failure of black capitalism to end racism is self-evident, as is the need to combine a class analysis with an anti-racist one in order to understand the needs of poor people of color. Even conservative critics of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have made this point, arguing for class-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policies as a better way of helping ""truly needy"" people of color. What remains to be seen is if these critics are sincere in their desire to help poor people of color or are merely searching for moral high ground from which to attack race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton's seven-member advisory panel must recognize that communities of color are not monolithic, that, like the rest of America, they are divided into economic classes with different problems and different needs. From here, the panel could build a consensus for a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism, not just defending race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policies that have proved to be, at best, tokenistic and, at worst, little more than pacification efforts designed to prop up a fundamentally racist system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What would a more comprehensive approach entail? It might examine, for example, how de-industrialization has impoverished inner cities and how attacks on the ""liberal interventionist state,"" coupled with the resegregation of the country through ""white flight"" to the suburbs, have allowed middle-class white voters to tax themselves to pay for direct services while shielding their tax dollars from federal programs that might be used for urban renewal or to help poor people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such an analysis might suggest that the problems faced by people of color who are are forced to attend inferior schools in underfunded school districts could be eased if school funding was equalized through state or federal subsidies. This simple change would go a long way toward establishing the ""level playing field"" conservatives profess to champion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the very least, a more comprehensive approach to fighting racism should acknowledge that racism is experienced differently by members of different economic classes and therefore needs to be addressed through a variety of strategies. For example, middle- and working-class African Americans today experience racism most acutely in the form of racial discrimination and segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These problems were exacerbated by a series of rulings issued in 1989 by the Rehnquist court that undercut many of the civil rights protections people of color had gained under the Warren court in the 1960s and the Burger court in the 1970s and early 1980s. The rulings combined to make voluntary <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs more difficult to establish and easier to undo, increased the burden of proving employment discrimination and drastically diminished the ability of people of color to fight segregation in employment, housing and education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other legal impediments to desegregation include various loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The law is weak not only because it is not vigorously enforced, but also because some of its provisions exempt people who own or rent fewer than four single-family houses, the vast majority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A more sympathetic Supreme Court, closing legal loopholes and vigorously enforcing anti-discrimination laws would help address the problem of racism within the middle and working classes. But legal changes are not likely to help members of the poverty class, whose circumstances are the result of structural changes in the economy. In the latter case, development of a broad-based employment-opportunity program that would include job creation, job training and free or subsidized child care is needed, not new dialogues about race relations. Opponents of government spending on such measures should consider that alternatives, such as building more prisons, are not without cost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...), VINCENT KIRSCH / for The Times</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Novoa is a student in the ethnic studies PhD program at UC Berkeley and teaches ethnic studies for the Peralta Community College School District</p></div>"		1							2
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2444131672.xml.txt	"<div><p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was all I wanted to be</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was in my late 20s, attending a conference for women lawyers in the 1970s. I sat in the front row of a large auditorium for the keynote address. The speaker was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the founder of the American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project. I was mesmerized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She was all that I wanted to be. To devote one's life to the fight for civil rights, to use legal skills to effect justice, better yet to make a difference — I could think of nothing greater. And I was not alone; generations of civil rights lawyers looked to emulate her.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg's vision of gender equality was decades ahead of her time. It went beyond just empowering women to compete for ""men's"" roles. While stereotypes distorted women's view of what was possible, they also impeded men, no less trapped in gender-based assumptions. Equality meant that both sexes should be free to assume all of society's roles without preconceptions. My son can be a caregiver; my daughter can be an executive. When the school administrators wanted Ginsburg to come to school to discuss her son's misconduct, she famously said, ""This child has two parents.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her record as an advocate before the Supreme Court was outstanding; she argued six cases before the court, winning five. If she had done nothing else in her life, that alone would have been an extraordinary legacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While she continued to be animated by her life's passion for equality when she joined the court, she was not the ""activist"" caricature some in the media have portrayed her to be. She was anxious to avoid upending precedent, determined to be respectful of the opinions of her colleagues. She believed in incremental legal change and emphasized the limited role that a court plays in a constitutional democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Ginsburg's understanding, courts have a critical role to play in identifying new understandings of the Constitution, but they must do so by ""measured motions."" They are part of a dialogue with other organs of government and with the people as well. She was critical of the reasoning in Roe v. Wade, because it had accomplished too much too soon. She was, as the New York Times's Linda Greenhouse described at the time of her confirmation, a ""judicial-restraint liberal.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>She would apply the court's precedents but take pains to situate them in their social and historical context. A Ginsburg decision would tirelessly recount the history of gender-based classifications, the ""stunningly anachronistic"" generalizations about men and women, as she described them, that were embedded in the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When, shortly after she joined the court, she wrote the majority opinion requiring that women be admitted to the all-male Virginia Military Institute, her analysis was classic Ginsburg: a lengthy description of the school, its prestige, its role in preparing men and only men for high-status roles in government and industry. In cases challenging <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs, she would recite the data that showed the persistence of racial inequity in housing, education and employment, the lingering effects of ""centuries of law-sanctioned inequality."" She prefigured today's debate about systemic discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg brought her own experiences to bear, insisting that legal rules be understood in ""the realities of the workplace,"" a reality she understood well. When a Supreme Court majority rejected Lilly Ledbetter's pay discrimination claim because she had sued too late, Ginsburg dissented, teaching her colleagues about how pay discrimination, unlike discrimination in promotions or hiring, was hidden from view; Ledbetter sued as soon as she found out about it. Goodwin Liu, a justice on the California Supreme Court and a former Ginsburg clerk, has said that when Ginsburg was recounting Ledbetter's story, she was also telling her own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Her judicial influence has to be measured not simply in the decisions she authored, but also in the decisions of her colleagues and lower-court judges, I among them. It extends to areas far beyond gender and race discrimination, including cases about access to justice, disability discrimination, the right to counsel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ginsburg was a reluctant dissenter, concerned about the moral weight of a decision when the court did not speak in a single voice. But in recent years, her role changed with the court's shifting membership. She dissented more and more — when the majority gutted the Voting Rights Act or enabled businesses to opt out of contraceptive coverage for employees based on a broad religion-based exemption. She dissented when the majority spoke paternalistically about women who felt compelled to end a pregnancy in the second trimester.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2013, years after that conference at which I first heard her speak, I gave the Ruth Bader Ginsburg address at the New York City Bar Association. The justice introduced me, with an unforgettable sense of humor and warmth. Afterward, she sent me a gift, not a fancy academic treatise, but a signed book of her late husband's recipes, with a moving note. If I published my talk, she wanted to make certain that I included the story about Sadie, my mother. That story? Even though I had graduated Yale Law School, Sadie wanted me to take the Triborough Bridge toll taker's test – just in case!</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409790149.xml.txt	"<div><p>It's The Law, Not the Judge; But These Days the Bench Is the Hot Seat</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The response to the rulings in Terri Schiavo's case, following close after the murder of a state judge in Atlanta and a federal judge's family in Chicago, has put not only judicial opinions but judges themselves suddenly under the spotlight. The U.S. Marshals Service reports a ""dramatic increase"" in threats against federal judicial officials in recent years. And political attacks on judges seem to grow ever more vitriolic. The title of a best-selling new book makes its unsubtle point: ""Men in Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judges today are being catapulted into public view as personalities who seem fair game for attack rather than as anonymous oracles of the law. Part of the reason for this is the legalization of politics: Both liberals and conservatives are increasingly asking judges to decide issues  --  from the right to die to presidential elections  --  that politics are unable to resolve. As a result, when politicians and disappointed litigants don't like the result of a judicial decision, they feel emboldened to demand a new judge rather than accepting their defeat with good grace. This new personalization of the judiciary poses grave threats to the idea of judicial independence, which judges should try to resist by avoiding the spotlight rather than courting it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Schiavo case is the most dramatic illustration of this trend in which politicians try to cherry-pick judges who agree with them and attack those who do not. Judge George W. Greer, the circuit court judge who presided over the case in Pinellas County, Fla., has been vilified throughout the ordeal: Opponents picketed him, bombarded him with harassing letters and e-mails, and threatened to impeach or even kill him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The response of Congress and the president to his ruling was unprecedented: They attempted to select a judge more to their liking by passing a law directing federal courts to ignore Greer's findings and to reexamine the case. But two federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same legal conclusions as Greer. That suggests the law is clear. But what did the disappointed petitioners do? They denounced the judiciary in general: ""The judges are running this country,"" Schiavo's father, Robert Schindler, said Thursday afternoon outside the hospice where his daughter has received much of her care since she collapsed in 1990.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress has contributed mightily to this poisonous atmosphere. Both parties are responsible for the escalating warfare over judicial nominations, which is now on the verge of blowing up the Senate, as Republicans prepare to eliminate the filibuster and Democrats prepare to retaliate by bringing other Senate business to a halt. This self-destruction would cap a decade of attacks on judges by both parties. In 2003, for example, Congress passed a law requiring that every time a federal judge reduces a sentence, the judge's name should be reported to Congress. ""The game is over for judges,"" announced Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been at least nine periods in American history when Congress has tried to curb judicial independence, beginning with the Jeffersonian Republicans' attacks on the Marshall court. What makes the current wave of judge-bashing unusual is that virulently personal attacks now come from both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals routinely denounce such Supreme Court justices as Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as partisan conspirators, and they publish books with titles like ""Right Wing Justice: The Conservative Campaign to Take Over the Courts."" And conservatives respond in kind. ""Some justices have been senile, racist, and crooked,"" Mark Levin, author of the conservative ""Men in Black,"" told the National Review Online. According to Levin, ""de facto judicial tyranny"" today ""frustrates and disenfranchises the American people and thwarts representative government.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to its intemperance, the accusation that judges are anti-democratic elitists is also flatly wrong. As Mark Tushnet of Georgetown University Law Center argues in a less popular but far more convincing new book, ""A Court Divided,"" the Rehnquist court has actually supported the views of a narrow majority of the American people, rather than thwarting them, in all the most controversial cases of the culture wars, involving <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay rights and access to early-term abortions. In the Schiavo case, too, polls show that a majority of Americans agreed with the federal judge's decision not to reinsert the feeding tube and strongly disagreed with Congress's effort to interfere in the legal battles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What can explain the odd gap between the political attacks on judges as tyrannical activists and the reality that, in most cases, for better or worse, they reflect the constitutional views of national majorities? The most obvious culprit: interest groups. Although judicial nominations are not a salient political issue for most of the country, they matter intensely to groups on the extreme left and right, who want to use the courts to achieve results they are unable to win at the ballot box. But there may be a political price to this pandering: President Bush and congressional Republicans have been placating their religious and social conservative base while alienating the rest of the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, judge bashing by the president and Congress creates an atmosphere of disrespect that encourages citizens to personalize the judiciary as well. In this more polarized, less hierarchical age, more people are proving unwilling to accept judicial decisions with which they disagree: If Congress can demand a new judge when it doesn't like the result of a case, why shouldn't a disappointed litigant, as well?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Journalists contribute to this personalization by emphasizing in stories about the courts, the political affiliation of federal judges and the presidents who appointed them. And even juries have succumbed to the pressures for personalization. Until the 1960s, jurors generally refused to talk to the press, reflecting the widespread convention that justice is blind; today, in high-profile trials, they have their own booking agents pitching them for the morning talk shows within moments after a verdict.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But judges are not entirely powerless in the face of these relentless cultural and political forces. Their most effective defense is to follow the law as scrupulously as possible and not to be rattled by political pressures. ""All the judges have banded together to support Judge Greer,"" Schiavo's father lamented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's important, too, for judges not to be rattled by political attacks into grandiose assertions of judicial supremacy. When the Rehnquist Court, in reaffirming Roe v. Wade in 1992 and the case requiring cops to give Miranda warnings in 2000, asserted that it alone was entitled to interpret the Constitution, it exaggerated its own political importance in a way that invited further congressional attacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, to the greatest degree possible, judges should try to avoid the spotlight. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were no judicial memoirs, in the modern sense. The first justice to present himself as a celebrity was William O. Douglas, who published a largely fictionalized account of his Pacific Northwest boyhood in 1974. But Douglas's unfortunate example may have been a harbinger of things to come. Not long ago, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor appeared on the morning talk shows to promote her own autobiography of her Western girlhood. And Clarence Thomas recently sold a memoir for $1.5 million.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A better approach is that of William Rehnquist, who told C-SPAN that he always admired Robert E. Lee's refusal to write a memoir; the chief justice didn't think it appropriate for judges to reveal their personalities in public. Unlike some of his colleagues, Rehnquist understands that ill-advised exercises in self-revelation only encourage citizens and politicians to respond to judges in personal terms. At the vmoment, the judiciary is the last branch of American government that has largely resisted the strong public pressures on officials to bare their emotions and personalities in public. And in our violently polarized age of celebrity, judges will encourage the personalization of justice at their own peril.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jeffrey Rosen is a law professor at George Washington University and legal affairs editor of the New Republic.

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, ""America in Black and White,"" Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p></div>"	2								2

Your local university or community college probably has an N.A.A.C.P. youth chapter; ignore it and find a kid who will say that Ice-T, Sister Souljah or Kool Moe Dee speaks for him or her. Do not ask whom the student will call if he or she is the victim of discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""N.A.A.C.P. Out of Touch With Black America!"" There are dozens of surveys that show blacks and the N.A.A.C.P. agree on most civil rights-related questions. Avoid these and dwell instead on abortion or the death penalty, issues where blacks are as divided as whites. Your Rolodex should have the names of a half dozen black Reagan-Bush conservatives. They're always good for a ""family values"" quotation or a verbal assault on the black leaders their sponsors hoped they'd replace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""N.A.A.C.P. in Disarray Over . . . "" Fill in ""Jackson bid"" or any other timely words or phrases; it doesn't matter. Remember when only 2 of the group's 2,200 branches and none of its board members supported Clarence Thomas? We were able to convince the public that the organization was split over the nomination, and we can do it again. Trot out those anonymous sources. Interview people who are members of rival groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Only Black Middle Class Helped by N.A.A.C.P."" Be careful here.

Ignore recent court rulings giving millions of dollars to blue-collar and low-skill blacks who have won civil rights suits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's another angle. While the black middle class has grown, black unemployment is still twice as high as it is for whites, and blacks still earn less money than comparable whites.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2452692303.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes ""would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%."" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended ""high-poverty"" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for ""low-poverty"" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,"" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Yale College will not change its admissions processes,"" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university ""will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421525331.xml.txt	"<div><p>Commentary; COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES W. ROBINSON; Eight-Hour Bill Shows Davis' True Colors; Forget what he says about charting a centrist course. Look at the actions he's taken since he was elected last fall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sooner or later it had to happen. After carefully cultivating the image that he is making good on his campaign pledge to lead California from the center, Gov. Gray Davis has taken a sharp turn leftward by signing legislation making California the only state except Alaska to require overtime pay after an eight-hour day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The decision unmasks a reality that state Republicans--still shell-shocked after last November's drubbing at the polls--have yet to effectively challenge Davis on, which is that the new governor's course is not nearly as centrist as he would like us to believe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Flanked on the left by an unarguably liberal California Legislature and the labor, environmental and trial lawyer interest groups that backed his candidacy, Davis barely needs to break a sweat to look moderate by comparison. But he can't leave those constituencies completely empty-handed--and he certainly hasn't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>State labor laws across the nation generally require overtime pay after a 40-hour week. Employers are comfortable with that rule and report that most employees governed by it seem to enjoy the flexibility of working fewer hours some days and making up the time on other days. The bill that Davis signed on Tuesday was one of organized labor's top legislative priorities for the year. It reverses a decision by the Industrial Welfare Commission two years ago to scrap overtime pay after an eight-hour day in favor of the 40-hour rule.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Jan. 1, 2000, California will thus become one of two states to require overtime pay after eight hours, which in this state affects some 8 million employees and tens of thousands of businesses. California workers and companies alike will lose flexibility. Employees now working more than eight hours a day but less than 40 hours a week will likely lose pay. And California's business climate can now be justifiably indicted by other states competing for investment and jobs as having the country's singularly most rigid regulatory regime governing workplaces.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While unions celebrated, Davis and his aides struggled to claim that, at the governor's insistence, employers' concerns were accommodated in the legislation with provisions allowing various exemptions. But those provisions offer nothing more than a fig leaf of flexibility, and neither Republican legislators nor the state's major business organizations bought it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom among Capitol-watchers has held that Davis alternates between tacking a little bit to the left, then a little bit to the right, keeping allies generally mollified, critics off-balance and his centrist image intact. Exhibiting the same message discipline they demonstrated throughout the campaign, Davis and his spinmeisters chant the ""I am governing from the center"" mantra virtually every day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But does the message match the record? Forcing state businesses to don a new regulatory straitjacket prescribed in the eight-hour legislation is not the first time in his young administration that Davis has veered off center. Union, environmental and trial lawyer activists have been rewarded with top appointments drawn from their ranks. Davis has orchestrated the reinstitution of a form of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> at the University of California. Despite promising a new relationship with Mexico, he is still on record opposing NAFTA and shows no sign of challenging his union supporters by backing other free-trade measures that can help California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tougher challenges to Davis' moderate image lie ahead. Will he approve legislation piling new mandates on health care plans and allowing patients to sue HMOs? How far will he go on gun control, labor and the environment? As reported by The Times' George Skelton, the governor and his aides are alarmed that an avalanche of bills landing on his desk on these subjects could, with increasing frequency, force Davis to choose between his natural political allies and his pledge to govern from the middle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis is no flaming liberal. He seems to genuinely understand the limits of government power and especially the limits to the voters' patience for a return to the halcyon days of big government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Sacramento is made up of more than just a governor, and a vast state administration is made up of more than one man. Union leaders, trial lawyers, environmentalists and activists who believe in regulatory expansion are in charge again. Every so often Davis tells them to slow down. But he doesn't tell them to stop.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: James W. Robinson is advisor to the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2009409469.xml.txt	"<div><p>How the Left Wins the Culture War</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wonder if I'm wrong on the subject of guns. I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women's March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states. The losing streak continues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet I have to admit that something bigger is going on. It could be that progressives understood something I didn't. It could be that you can win more important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade than you can through legislation. Progressives could be on the verge of delegitimizing their foes, on guns but also much else, rendering them untouchable for anybody who wants to stay in polite society. That would produce social changes far vaster than limiting assault rifles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two things have fundamentally changed the landscape. First, over the past two years conservatives have self-marginalized. In supporting Donald Trump they have tied themselves to a man whose racial prejudices, sexual behavior and personal morality put him beyond the pale of decent society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While becoming the movement of Dinesh D'Souza, Sean Hannity and Franklin Graham, they have essentially expelled the leaders and thinkers who have purchase in mainstream culture. Conservatism is now less a political or philosophic movement and more a separatist subculture that participates in its own ostracism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, progressives are getting better and more aggressive at silencing dissenting behavior. All sorts of formerly legitimate opinions have now been deemed beyond the pale on elite campuses. Speakers have been disinvited and careers destroyed. The boundaries are being redrawn across society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Andrew Sullivan noted recently, ""workplace codes today read like campus speech codes of a few years ago."" There are a number of formerly popular ideas that can now end your career: the belief that men and women have inherent psychological differences, the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, opposition to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's happening today is that certain ideas about gun rights, and maybe gun ownership itself, are being cast in the realm of the morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the importance of the corporate efforts to end N.R.A. affiliations. It's not about N.R.A. members saving some money when they fly. It's that they are not morally worthy of being among the affiliated groups. The idea is to stigmatize.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If progressives can cut what's left of the conservative movement off from mainstream society, they will fundamentally alter the culture war. We think of the culture war as this stagnant thing in which both sides scream at each other. But eventually there could be a winner. Progressives have won on most social issues. They could win on nearly everything else.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Continued school shootings could be just the thing that persuades the mainstream that conservatism is vulgar and socially illegitimate, somewhere between smoking and segregationism. If that kind of total victory is on offer for progressives, why should they take my advice and tone things down for the sake of a few small gun laws? The big prize here is not gun laws. It's winning the culture war, with the gunfight as the final battle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only thing I'd say to my progressive friends is, be careful how you win your victories. It is one thing to win by persuasion and another thing to win by elite cultural intimidation. Illiberalism breeds illiberalism. Using elite power, whether economic or cultural, to silence less educated foes usually produces a backlash.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have zero cultural power, but they have immense political power. Even today, voters trust Republicans on the gun issue more than Democrats. If you exile 40 percent of the country from respectable society they will mount a political backlash that will make Donald Trump look like Adlai Stevenson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p></div>"			3					6

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2778538694.xml.txt	"<div><p>Why I'm Running for President</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America is in the midst of a national identity crisis. We hunger for purpose at a moment when faith, patriotism and hard work are on the decline. We embrace secular religions like climatism, Covidism and gender ideology to satisfy our need for meaning, yet we can't answer what it means to be an American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party's top priority should be to fill this void with an inspiring national identity that dilutes the woke agenda to irrelevance. Instead, many top Republicans recite slogans they memorized in 1980 or criticize left-wing culture without offering an alternative. To put America first, we need to rediscover what America is. That's why I am running for president. I am launching not only a political campaign but a cultural movement to create a new American Dream -- one that is not only about money but about the unapologetic pursuit of excellence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may seem presumptuous for a 37-year-old political outsider to pursue the highest office in the land, but I am running on a vision for our nation -- one that revives merit in every sphere of American life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit for who gets to come to America. My parents entered this country legally, worked hard and raised two kids who went on to create businesses that improved the lives of thousands of Americans. We need more immigrants like them, instead of those who break the law when they enter our country. That means securing the border unapologetically and eliminating lottery-based immigration in favor of meritocratic admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must embrace merit in who gets to succeed in America. The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn racial preferences in college admissions. As president I will eliminate <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> across the American economy. Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 mandates that federal contractors -- which employ approximately 20% of the U.S. workforce -- adopt race-based hiring preferences. Top companies now regularly disfavor qualified applicants who happen to be white or Asian-American, which spawns resentment and condescension toward black and Hispanic hires. I will rescind this executive order and direct the Justice Department to prosecute illegal race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must revive merit in who gets to govern in America. Democracy depends on a simple principle: The people we elect to run the government must be the people who actually run the government. The next time unelected bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci or Merrick Garland reach beyond their legal scope, I commit to doing what the president is constitutionally empowered to do: fire them. I will repeal civil-service protections for federal employees, by executive order if necessary, and replace these managerial protections with sunset clauses. If the president can't hold his position for more than eight years, neither should most bureaucrats. I will call on Congress to repeal or amend the 1974 Impoundment Control Act and will stop funding agencies that waste money or have outlived their purpose. I will shut down agencies that can't be reformed and create new ones built from scratch to replace them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit in determining which ideas win in America. The best ideas are born when no ideas are censored. Yet our government pressures technology companies to censor disfavored political speech and gives them special protections to carry it out. Internet companies are bound by the First Amendment when they act in concert with state actors. As Elon Musk did at Twitter, I will release the ""state action files"" from the federal government -- publicly exposing every known instance in which bureaucrats have wrongfully pressured companies to take constitutionally prohibited actions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Viewpoint censorship extends beyond the internet and pervades our economy. If you can't fire someone for being black, gay or Muslim, you shouldn't be able to fire someone for his political speech. I will work with Congress to enshrine political expression as an American civil right, and I will enforce existing civil-rights laws to protect workers from invidious viewpoint discrimination. The federal prohibition on religious discrimination forbids employers from forcing employees to bow down to any religion, including secular ones as defined by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Seeger (1965) and Torcaso v. Watkins (1961). The modern woke agenda in much of corporate America fits that bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once we revive our national identity around shared principles, we can muster the fortitude needed to defeat the greatest external threat to America: the rise of communist China. Unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, China today powers the modern American way of life. We must declare economic independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must reclaim global energy leadership by rejecting the demands of a new climate religion that shackles the U.S. and leaves China untouched. We must achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency while vigorously protecting Taiwan. We should prohibit kids under 16 from using TikTok. We must use financial levers to hold China accountable for spawning the Covid-19 pandemic. We must even be willing to bar U.S. companies from expanding into China until its government abandons theft and other mercantilist tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can rise to this occasion if we rediscover who we really are. America's strength isn't our diversity but the ideals that unify us across our differences. These ideals won the American Revolution, reunited us after the Civil War, won two World Wars and the Cold War. They still give hope to the free world.

Universities use many factors in admissions. How did he know his client was turned down for being white? When he replied that race simply could never be used, Justice O'Connor said tartly, ''You have some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with.'' Moments later, she added, ''You are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There could have been little doubt among the spectators packed into the Supreme Court last Tuesday that history was being made. Outside, thousands of protesters marched with signs proclaiming ''Equal Opportunity for All,'' and, in the case of one young marcher, a photo of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School. The conservative Center for Individual Rights, which is backing the plaintiffs, spoke of the day being ''Affirmative Action's Alamo.'' The two cases against the University of Michigan -- one against its undergraduate program, the other against its law school -- came to the Supreme Court with five years of momentum. But Justice O'Connor may have stopped them in their tracks in under five minutes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To say that Justice O'Connor is the most powerful woman in America is a court-watching cliche, and one even she is tired of hearing. When another judge suggested as much at a judicial conference, she said, ''You've been reading too many newspapers.'' But Justice O'Connor has often been the Rehnquist court's swing vote, a solid member of the five-justice conservative majority who nonetheless has broken away at critical moments. Since the court's four liberal members are likely to vote to uphold <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, the white plaintiffs probably need Justice O'Connor to ''get to five,'' as they say on the court. Based on her questions at oral argument -- an imperfect indicator, certainly -- and on her history, it seems she may end up being <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>'s unlikely savior.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice O'Connor was raised on an Arizona ranch during the Depression, driving tractors and working with cattle. She graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School, but the only law firm job she could get was as a legal secretary. She later found work as a lawyer, and became active in Republican Party politics, including Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential race. After just two years on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she was plucked from obscurity in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, who had courted women's votes with a promise to name a woman to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 22 years since, Justice O'Connor has been no one's idea of a liberal. She has written a number of decisions that stand out as not merely conservative, but callous. In 1988, she rejected the claim of a North Dakota child, who lived 16 miles from her school, that she had a right to ride a school bus without paying a fee that her family could not afford. Justice O'Connor has also been largely unsympathetic to African-Americans in discrimination and voting rights cases.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Feminist scholars have long scrutinized her legal thinking, looking for a ''different voice,'' but she has not made it easy. She has sympathized with female plaintiffs, notably a hard-driving woman denied a partnership at Price Waterhouse. But she has turned a deaf ear to others, including a group of blue-collar Ford plant workers challenging a sex-discrimination ruling. For children, she has shown both a soft spot (for student athletes), and a cold heart (for juveniles facing deportation). Some scholars point to cases like these and make the not very flattering argument that Justice O'Connor sympathizes mainly with white, middle-class, up-by-the-bootstraps women -- in other words, people like herself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What has earned Justice O'Connor a reputation as a swing vote is her reluctance to sign on to sweeping pronouncements. She is more inclined than her fellow conservatives to look at the specific facts of a case, worry about a ruling's effect on real people, and pull back before upsetting a major precedent. She disappointed abortion opponents early on when she scaled back abortion rights but refused to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is, of course, no way of being certain how last week's cases will come out. But there is much in Justice O'Connor's two decades on the court to suggest she will, in the end, side with the university. The argument that the Constitution requires absolute colorblindness clearly leaves her cold.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Current university policy relies on Bakke, the landmark 1978 decision allowing race to be considered in admissions. Justice O'Connor may be as unwilling to reverse this well-known case as she was to overturn Roe. The colorblind regime the plaintiffs want would also drive many minorities off elite campuses. Justice O'Connor, who asked at argument what impact California's anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> referendum has had on law schools there, is likely to worry about this real-world impact.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is Justice O'Connor's inclination to look for herself in the litigants who appear before her. On the surface, Justice O'Connor may seem like the white plaintiffs in these cases. But she owes her place on the court not only to her immense talent and drive, but also to a governmental act -- in her case, by President Reagan -- that can only be called <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. In the end, Justice O'Connor may take a close look at the hard-working, bright University of Michigan applicants who get a few extra points on their applications because they are minorities -- and see herself.</p></div>"		1					3

Gray Davis cleaned up last year railing about California's sorry schools. Pete Wilson left the governor's office on a high note after morphing into an education reformer.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some time, education has been the winning issue for California politicians. Candidates who ignored it--like Dan Lungren last year--were themselves ignored by voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But now at least one pollster believes that the issue has peaked and soon will hit the skids as the voters' top concern. ""Health care is charging to the top,"" asserts Steve Kinney of Hermosa Beach, a GOP operative and pollster for 30 years. However, ""infrastructure is the fastest growing issue,"" he adds, and probably will be No. 1 by the 2002 election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's assuming the economy keeps booming. If not, Kinney foresees voters fretting more about taxes, crime and jobs--as they did earlier in the decade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's theory about education as a voter motivator is that the politicians--especially Davis--will talk themselves out of a good issue, like animals overgrazing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Legislature passes the governor's modest reform proposals, the feds kick in more education money and all the pols beat their chests about how they're fixing the schools, voters will believe the problem is being handled, Kinney predicts. Contributing to this complacency will be the voters' memory of having passed a record $9.2-billion school bond issue last November.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Once it's perceived that a problem has been talked about enough and is being solved,"" Kinney says, ""people focus on a new issue.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As evidence, Kinney points to illegal immigration and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, hot issues that cooled after passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Crime also lost political punch after voters passed the three-strikes initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney bases his analyses on the voters' intensity of concern. He doesn't just ask people which issues they consider the most important, as pollsters usually do. He asks how important a specific issue is to them ""personally--on a scale of one to 10."" Then he counts only the ""10s."" The others can be swayed too easily to another view, he contends.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kinney's polling at the end of 1998 showed education still at No. 1, but health care climbing; 80% called education a ""10,"" compared to 67% for health care. Crime was 35% and taxes 28%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Education will slip to fourth or fifth by midyear,"" he predicts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such public passivity is hard to imagine, however, given the latest bad news--screamed in headlines all over the state--that California ranks next to last nationally in fourth-grade reading skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis' pollster, Paul Maslin, agrees with Kinney about the trend, but not the timing. ""Over a five-year period, he's right,"" Maslin says, ""But I'm not sure he's right over the next two years. I really believe we're a long way from this {education} thing playing out.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maslin does buy the thesis that health care and infrastructure--highways, potholes, water--will escalate as political issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""As the baby boomers get older, health care will become a lot more personal and worrisome,"" he notes. ""And the state's population is growing again. Well, guess what? We're going to have to figure out a way to build not only more schools, but more water pipes, more roads. . . . Is this state broken or not?""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the new governor hasn't been focusing on much except promoting his school bills, mostly at campaign-style road shows.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis did announce in his State of the State address that he would create a ""Commission on Building for the 21st Century,"" under Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, to develop an infrastructure master plan. The panel was given a May 1 deadline to report back. But two months later, Davis still has not appointed the commission members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two Democratic legislative leaders seem more on the cutting edge of future issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles is sponsoring legislation to expand health care coverage for the working poor. There are 7 million uninsured Californians, he notes, and 40% live in L.A. County. ""Health care should be a right, not a privilege,"" asserts the potential mayoral candidate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco is pushing a $16-billion bond package to modernize the state's transportation system. Besides easing congestion, the liberal lawmaker says his proposal would boost California's economy. ""And if you don't have a growing economy that produces enough revenue to take care of working people and the poor,"" he adds, ""I have real emotional problems.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Davis should get out front and lead on these emerging issues, show he can handle more than one problem at a time. The Legislature won't wait. And if the pollster is right, the public may not either.</p></div>"			3					6

Today President Clinton will be at Central High to open the door for the nine men and women whose courageous walk opened doors for so many others. He will be introduced by student body president Fatima McKendra, honor student, aspiring surgeon, African American. This young woman could not have been student body president in 1957.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How far have we really come in 40 years? How far have we left to go? I was 2 years old when those brave students walked through angry, jeering crowds, past armed soldiers to the front door of Central High. It was not until years later that, as an African American teenager, I had the occasion to go to school with white children in Marianna, Ark.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And still it was not easy. After my school canceled a program celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, students staged a sit-in. They were chased from the school grounds by firemen spraying them with high-powered blasts of water. The student officers, including myself, who had been meeting in the principal's office were taken to the police station. We did not go back to school that year. And when I did go back, I was not allowed to play sports, a severe penalty for someone who later went to college on a football and academic scholarship.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a watershed experience for me. I learned that you have to take a stand in what you believe is right. There is always a cost. But often there is a higher cost for not taking a stand.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolerance actually got an early start in Arkansas. The University of Arkansas law and medical schools had been integrated since 1948. The city of Little Rock already had desegregated its public buses, its zoo, its library and its parks system, and its citizens were poised to deal with integration in a positive way. They were guided by what President Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. But the actions of a few encouraged the lesser angels to manifest themselves. Notwithstanding, justice prevailed, the school was integrated and Ernest Green, the lone senior of the Little Rock Nine, graduated in May 1958.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have come a long way since then. Our economy is healthy, unemployment is low, and the African American middle class has grown substantially.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite our progress, we are slowed by unfinished business. We still are wary of those different from us. Too often, we talk less to each other and more at each other, if we talk at all. As terrible as things were 40 years ago, at least people knew exactly where they stood. Things were out in the open and on the table. Ironically, racism clad in a hooded sheet was much more identifiable than much of the racism of today, which often wears a smile and a business suit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, problems 40 years ago were more blatant. What we face today is more subtle, but still insidious. We get a glimpse when we hear about demeaning conversations in corporate boardrooms. Or when <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> rules are lifted at state universities and minority enrollment plummets. Or when academics and writers fall back on discredited arguments to justify persistent stereotypes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And tensions now go beyond the conflict between black and white: the vile burning of churches, a resurgence of antisemitism and hostility toward new immigrants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we have to learn to live together, because the face of America is changing. Today in Hawaii, everyone is a minority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon this will be true of California. And 40 years from now, there will be no majority race in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can look at statistics and know what America will look like in the 21st century. But we have to look inside ourselves to determine what America will be like in the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president is asking all Americans to join him in a national conversation about race to face one another honestly across lines that still divide us. Clearly, now is the time for honest dialogue, the time to build a society that recognizes the worth of all people and honors the dignity of every person.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until every American has real economic opportunity and first-rate educational opportunity, there will be disparities that will look like racial discrimination, whether they are or not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melba P. Bealls, one of the Little Rock Nine, put it best: ""The task that remains is to cope with our interdependence to see ourselves reflected in every other human being and to respect and honor our differences.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laws can change institutions, but they cannot change what is in people's hearts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is secretary of transportation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO,,Arkansas Democrat Via Ap/will Counts</p></div>"	2			4

Democrat Bill Clinton continues to appeal to about the same 43% of the electorate that voted for him in 1992. On the Republican side, Sens. Bob Dole and Phil Gramm are running hard, along with a roomful of hopefuls struggling for national recognition. But so far none of these candidacies is drawing many oohs and ahs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This lack of excitement about what the two major parties have to offer is not new to U.S. presidential politics; today as before, the disenchantment has something to do with the personalities of the candidates. But on a more fundamental level it reflects a darkening mood among Americans. The growing distrust of the professional political class, the frustration with the simplistic nostrums peddled by the ideological left and right alike, the feeling that the political procedure has gone awry--all have left many voters unhappy with both the governing process and the choices they sense will be presented next year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us to Colin Powell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LOOK OF A LEADER: The retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has begun a multi-city tour to promote his newly published memoirs. Inescapably, this commercial enterprise bodes to become indistinguishable from a national political progression. For at this stage in his life, Powell--articulate, intelligent, experienced in Washington politics and in global affairs, a true American success story--can accurately be called charismatic. Ready or not, he is about to become an object of the closest political scrutiny. In our current political culture, with its deficit of leadership, Powell has the look of a leader about him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He says he will make a decision on his future in the next few months. Only now is he beginning to outline his views on domestic issues. He prefers adoption to abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. A gun owner, he favors gun control. He supports some <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. He opposes mandatory prayer in the schools but supports moments of silence. All this seems to place him in the broad, moderate middle--not an ideal place for anyone hoping to get the nomination at the 1996 GOP convention. If Powell is truly thinking about presidential politics, that thinking may well lie outside the two-party system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TWO KEY FACTORS: The huge difficulty in running for the presidency without the support of a national party organization doesn't necessarily mean that such a campaign is impossible. Two things right now promote a Powell candidacy. The first is voter interest in having another choice, an alternative to what the two parties may offer. The other is the perceived strength of Powell's character.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's always possible the Powell bubble will burst in a few months. It's also possible that he just may be the instrument to re-energize a public fed up with the nastiness, the phoniness and the cynicism of politics.</p></div>"			3					6

They're showing that this mayor--this son of the Old Guard--is trying hard to right old wrongs and create opportunities for blacks and Hispanics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, his commitment to integrating the police and fire commands may be more a product of political peacekeeping than a craving for justice, but compared to the union bosses, Daley is performing like a latter-day Lincoln.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the vicious and misleading radio commercials being run by the Fraternal Order of Police to whip up resentment against Daley's use of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in police promotions. The spot begins with a mock ""auction"" of sergeant's stripes to the highest bidder. An authoritative voice warns ominously that the bad old days of political clout have returned to the police promotion process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this because the city, in an effort to get more black and Hispanic sergeants and lieutenants, is going to base 30 percent of the next promotional draft on job performance, not just test scores.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the moaning and wailing of the Chicago Fire Fighters Union, which in 32 months of contract negotiations resisted a similar method to get more black and Hispanic lieutenants, captains and battalion chiefs. Finally, union leaders agreed grudgingly to basing 10 percent of promotions on performance rather than test scores, but only when the city agreed to pay the salaries of the top three union officers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's a union, 31 percent of whose members are black or Hispanic, holding out against Daley's efforts to promote an equitable number of blacks and Hispanics. Here's a union in which not a single minority has been elected to the governing board from its 13 city districts. Here's a union that gives full voting rights to retired members, who are predominantly white, and barely gives the time of day to nearly a third of its active membership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So it falls to the Daley administration to produce a police and fire service that reflects, if not mirrors, the racial and ethnic makeup of the entire city. And progress must be eked out in spite of the unions, not because of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for black and Hispanic police and firefighters who complain the city is moving too slowly, it is they who need to gear up and get organized. It takes hard work to exert power within a union, just as it takes hard work to get ready for an exam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Minority shots at Daley, like those from the unions, only reinforce the perception that the mayor has got this one about right.</p></div>"	2			4

Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced recently that he is worried about the ""hard, hard right"" of the Republican Party, people whose goal is to turn ""the clock back to the 1930s or the 1890s."" I've never met one myself. There is no such Republican in the president's Cabinet, none in the Senate, and Schumer is talking nonsense. He wants to conceal the Big Switch that has transformed American politics. Today the Democrats are the party of reactionary liberalism. Republicans are the true progressives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet if Schumer is mostly wrong, he is also unintentionally revealing. He seems to believe that ""hard right"" Republicans pine for the 1930s -- when statesmen like FDR and his disciples dominated the scene. He's right: Many Republicans do admire FDR. Republicans, after all, are his spiritual heirs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is serious business. If you agree that President Bush has no automatic right to call himself Lincoln's successor just because they are both ""Republicans,"" then Democrats have no automatic right to FDR's mantle either. The Democrats and Republicans switched roles while no one was looking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schumer is a main man for the Dems, architect of a fine new way of holding a knife to the Senate's throat. Democrats threaten to filibuster Bush judicial nominees; one touch of Schumer's magic wand and they can no longer be confirmed by majorities, only landslides. (How many Democratic senators won by landslides?) If Republicans change the rules to disallow such vindictiveness, Democrats promise to throw a fit and bring Senate business to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The filibuster scheme perfectly epitomizes modern Democrats. Republicans want to move forward, confirm some judges. The Democrats' response: Freeze! Or we talk you to death. Democrats are the Stand Still party. They adore the status quo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives won't settle for the status quo. They want this nation to champion justice, humanity, democracy. Democrats want America to tip-toe around the globe minding its own business, upsetting no one, venerating the Earth, etc. Why did Democrats leap to label Afghanistan and Iraq ""new Vietnams""? Vietnam was 30-plus years ago! But for Democrats it is always 1974. Things change -- but Democrats don't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans want better schools: Why not try vouchers on a serious scale? Democrats' response: Hands off! Republicans want to knock the chip off the U.N.'s shoulder and retune Social Security so that even the poor can leave assets to their children. Democrats' response: Hands off! Conservatives wonder, why not let the people's representatives in state legislatures determine the nation's abortion policy? Democrats' response: Are you crazy? The smelly masses? Why is it their business?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today's Democrats dislike democracy on principle, like Russian nobility circa 1905. Should Bush be allowed to pick federal judges merely because Republicans won the presidency, the Senate, the House, the country? No way! And why let the people decide about homosexual marriage when left-wing judges can make the law? Connecticut's governor just signed a law approving civil unions for gays and also stipulating that ""marriage"" means a man and a woman. Whatever you think of the outcome, this is democracy -- Schumerite Democrats should check it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the nation's universities, an occasional conservative wonders whether just maybe racism, sexism and ""class-ism"" no longer explain every bad thing in the world. Could 30 years of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> be enough? There are tenured professors who can't even remember a world without it.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432471477.xml.txt	"<div><p>How the 'Radicals' Can Save the Democrats</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sam Tanenhaus, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is writing a biography of William F. Buckley Jr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A battle for the soul of the Democratic Party has broken out, pitting a predominantly liberal field of presidential hopefuls against moderate party leaders and political strategists. While Howard Dean and John Kerry have been stirring up crowds plainly eager to have at President Bush, Democratic officials have been trying to tamp the fervor down, warning that ''extremists'' will take the party back to the dark ages of 1972 and 1984.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, with Mr. Bush looking formidable and the Republicans in control of Congress, the urge toward moderation may seem sensible. But it ignores a glaring fact: Republicans have repeatedly won elections in recent decades largely by taking the opposite approach: giving free rein to their raucous base and choosing candidates who excite the party's rank and file. And isn't that, after all, what political parties are supposed to do?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly, none of the top Democratic contenders are truly radical. Mr. Kerry, who happens to be the wealthiest member of the Senate, perhaps went overboard when he read aloud the pay packages of several business executives at an A.F.L.-C.I.O. event the other day. But if he's an extremist, so was Franlin D. Roosevelt, who railed against ''unscrupulous money changers'' in 1933. And to exaggerate the threat of an imminent ''far left'' takeover of the party -- as Senator Evan Bayh, head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, recently did -- really implies a repudiation of much of the party's traditional beliefs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides, it is not at all clear that far-left ideology was the cause of past Democratic defeats -- or that ideology plays a truly decisive role in presidential elections. While political strategists and pundits tend think in terms of sharply delineated issues, most voters do not. ''The American Voter,'' the landmark study by University of Michigan researchers published in 1960 and still a very useful guide to its subject, found that only one-fourth of the electorate held a clear opinion on most issues and identified those positions with one party or the other. A mere 2 percent could be classified as holding a consistently ''ideological'' position on overall policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And to judge from recent elections, little has changed. In the 1980's the public supported the anti-Soviet, anti-government views of Ronald Reagan. In the 1990's the same public favored the globalist, pro-government politics of Bill Clinton. And neither president was held to the bar of consistency, whether it was the conservative Mr. Reagan creating huge deficits or the liberal Mr. Clinton dismantling welfare.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, too, with President Bush, who now seems a small-government conservative (tax cuts for the rich), now a big-government liberal (prescription drug benefits), now a social liberal (favoring some types of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>), now a social conservative (opposed to gay marriage).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if abstract ideology plays a limited role in presidential races, the importance of ideologues and extremists -- that is, of people who cling to strong beliefs -- can't be overstated. It is they who bring passion and energy to politics, as Dr. Dean's Web-linked legions are now doing. Without these ''radicals,'' parties can lose their way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican establishment learned this lesson almost despite itself in the 1964 election. Democrats would do well to study that campaign, too, since its circumstances were remarkably similar to those unfolding today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back then, of course, the positions were reversed. A strong Democratic incumbent, Lyndon Johnson, was buoyed by a national crisis that rallied the public behind him: the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Republican Party chieftains, facing almost certain defeat, wanted to anoint a moderate candidate like Nelson Rockefeller or William Scranton, who could at least make a respectable showing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the party rank and file, tired of me-too politics and demanding ''a choice, not an echo,'' ardently backed the conservative Barry Goldwater. Party moderates, sounding just like today's worried Democrats, warned that Goldwater was an extremist whose nomination might marginalize the party for decades to come. They mounted a last-minute offensive to stop him, but Goldwater squeaked through, shocking his adversaries (and thrilling his followers) when he declared in his acceptance speech: ''Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.'' After that, most agreed, he was finished. And indeed he was trounced by Johnson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for Republicans this was not the devastating setback it appeared. On the contrary, it was the crucial first step toward a historic victory. Goldwater's ''extremism'' turned out, on closer inspection, to be a form of idealism that revitalized the conservative movement in the years ahead. Youthful veterans of the Goldwater movement -- including Lee Edwards of the Heritage Foundation and Howard Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus -- help set a new policy agenda. Richard Viguerie, a member of the pro-Goldwater group Young Americans for Freedom, became an innovative fund-raiser. Patrick Buchanan, another Goldwaterite, helped formulate the more conservative components of Richard Nixon's agenda as a White House speechwriter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over time the party shed its ''me too'' approach and developed a more sophisticated ideological style, which culminated in Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory. Today it is Lyndon Johnson's big-government heirs whom centrist Democrats say are on the fringes, while the Goldwater-influenced conservatives plausibly claim to occupy the mainstream.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party would never again underestimate the uses of zeal and continues to exploit it. In fact, even as the Democratic Leadership Council sounded its alarm in Philadelphia, some 1,000 young right-wing firebrands assembled at the Republican college convention in Washington. They excitedly discussed Ann Coulter's new book ''Treason,'' which depicts liberals as the enemy within, and heard from a prominent lobbyist who described Democrats as ''the ascension of evil, the bad guys, the Bolsheviks.'' Other highlights were speeches by Tom DeLay, the vociferous House majority leader, and Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political maestro, who looked delighted by the enthusiasm of these extremists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our two major parties seem to have swapped identities. The Republican establishment, presumably allied with the rich and privileged, embraces its populist core of hard-edged activists, while the Democratic elite, supposed champions of ''the people,'' evidently fears them. Only one party has learned the lesson of 1964 -- that extremists should not be lectured to but listened to, because they may have something important to say.</p></div>"			3					6

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/421647247.xml.txt	"<div><p>Commentary; UC Regents Inject Race Into Admissions, Yet Again</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With great fanfare the Board of Regents of the University of California has announced new admissions policies. These policies will downgrade academic qualifications (grades and test scores) and will include factors such as the students' athletic or artistic ability or struggle against poverty. The supporters of these changes say they will not use the new rules to promote raced-based admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real goal of the new guidelines is the elimination of the concepts of fairness and objectivity from the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is no accident that most colleges use the SAT and high school grades as the main criteria for admissions. These have been shown for decades to be the best predictors of scholastic performance. The SAT has the added advantage over grades in that everyone takes the same test and the test is scored the same way for everyone. The SAT is objective. It is blind to race, gender, age, politics, religion, national origin and sexual orientation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is precisely why the regents oppose it. They want the admissions process to be subjective. This means that hidden agendas can be brought into the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe that the new guidelines will not be politicized? UC Berkeley is one of the most left-wing schools in the country. Ability aside, who is more likely to get admitted there under the new ""flexible"" guidelines--the high school radical who claims that the attack on the World Trade Center was our fault or the conservative student who supports our right to self-defense?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe, despite explicit disclaimers to the contrary, that race will not be brought back as a factor in admissions?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May the regents voted to drop a 6-year-old ban on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Because state law prohibits <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in public hiring and admissions, the regents clearly were sending a message by their vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new criteria will serve to protect the university system against discrimination charges by academically qualified students of the wrong race. Previously, students who were discriminated against because of race could show that they should have been admitted because their test scores and grades were better than those who were admitted. If they took the case to court, they usually won. Now the university can say, ""We used a holistic procedure based on numerous factors that vary from student to student, and we decided that student X had a special combination of qualities that we wanted and student Y did not."" Such subjective guidelines offer a rejected student no chance of winning in a court of law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The regents claim that the new guidelines will allow the admission of people with athletic ability. Whom are they trying to fool? For better or for worse, good athletes have been given preference in admissions to colleges and universities for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And how does a struggle against poverty, as admirable as that is, qualify one for college admission?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard C. Atkinson says that high school students can gain admittance if they work hard and take tough courses. But how can he promise such a thing if the new guidelines specifically de-emphasize academics? Under the new procedures, it is impossible for a student to know what to do to prepare for college. The new ""flexible"" criteria can be anything the admissions office wants. The ones to suffer the most will be precisely the intelligent, hard- working, high-achieving students who most deserve admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real motive for the new admissions criteria is egalitarianism. The regents cannot accept the fact that some people are more academically qualified than others so their solution is to undermine the concept of academic competence. If they succeed, both students and universities will be the worse for it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Edwin A.

Now everyone knows drastic change is needed to root out the racism and pettiness that have infected Local 2 ever since its 1980 strike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A leader of that bitter walkout was William Kugelman, then and now an outspoken opponent of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> who earlier this year was elected union president. A main contract issue, then and now, is the department's ability to consider performance--as well as test scores and longevity--in determining which candidates are promoted in rank. The idea, then and now, is to create a fire service command structure that roughly mirrors the diverse city it serves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even considering the history, Kugelman's opening shot in negotiations for a new contract is simply outrageous. And not because firefighters want to jack their pay by more than a third over the next 2 1/2 years, or change already-inefficient work rules even more in their favor. There's no harm asking for the moon, even though Daley would be derelict to accept changes that could double the fire budget.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What galls is a pathetic effort to turn back the clock on race. Local 2 would do away with the ""merit"" promotions that have allowed the advancement of some blacks and Hispanics (though not so many that the department has reached its stated goals.) The union is also asking for two more paid holidays: Arbor Day and Bud Billiken Day. Both are facetious but the latter is inflammatory. Kugelman & Co. must think themselves clever, asking for the day in late summer when black Chicago celebrates youth with a back-to-school parade on the South Side. Ha, ha.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor Daley should use this next contract to implement the many reforms recommended by outside experts. Number one is to end racist buffoonery in the fire department. It's time to stand up to the so- called Brotherhood of the Barrel and all it represents.</p></div>"	2			4

Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's political skills abandoned him recently when he participated in a racial dialogue that pointedly excluded whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's town meeting in Akron last week was fumbling and lacking focus. Mr. Clinton was snappish with one of the few prominent dissident voices and overstated the case when he declared that Colin Powell got to his exalted rank in the Army because of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this still is a very worthwhile effort. America has fumbled, and worse, on race for 250 years. Thus it's hardly surprising that a reasonably ambitious effort for addressing this festering American malady would encounter early trouble.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, this is a departure for President Clinton, who too often has focused on the small-bore, politically easy agenda items that his former political strategist, the infamous Dick Morris, so cheaply champions. But race is not small bore or easy. There's not only a risk that this won't succeed, but given the history, the odds are that it won't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes it's easy to forget that a little over 30 years ago, there were precious few blacks in the executive suites, newsrooms or political corridors; it was commonplace for African-Americans to be excluded from public accommodations and even the vote, and that throughout much of the South, drinking fountains were marked ""colored"" or ""white.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet for all the extraordinary progress over these past three decades, race remains an excruciating American dilemma. That's why the multifaceted Clinton initiative is as commendable as it is complex.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael K. Frisby reported in this newspaper last week that the White House is bringing the advisory committee on race back firmly under its control. New proposals, with a focus on youth, are being hatched in time for the January State of the Union address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And there is far more sensitivity to the rap that this has been a one-sided dialogue excluding many conservatives or critics of controversial ideas like <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Next Wednesday, the advisory committee will meet with prominent conservative Bill Bennett. Two days later, President Clinton will meet with Jack Kemp and, probably, Ward Connerly, who led California's successful anti<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> ballot initiative last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, the specter of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> hangs over this discussion. Americans are sharply divided over granting selective preferences to minorities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is seen as quotas or rigid preferences, particularly in school admissions or hiring and promotion, Americans are overwhelmingly opposed. If it is seen as opening up, assuring and even fostering equal opportunities, the public is solidly for it. The problem is that <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> has been all of the above.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In two of the most publicized votes, Californians by 54% to 46% voted down <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> on the state level a year ago. By the same margin, voters in Houston last month voted to continue that city's <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program. In both cases, the opposing side argued the decision was stacked or the wording of the referendum was flawed; in fact, both votes are very indicative of where America is.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was evident in the highly publicized incident at the president's town meeting in Akron, Ohio, last week. He asked author and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> critic Abigail Thernstrom if she wanted to end the type of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs that promoted Colin Powell in the Army. This issue and exchange has been seized upon by both sides with considerably more heat than light.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, according to Clifford Alexander, who was Secretary of the Army when Gen. Powell became a general, the promotion board came back with a paucity of minority candidates. He simply sent them back to see if other candidates could be found; Colin Powell was in the next group. ""This was not an <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> program,"" Mr. Alexander says.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's absurd to suggest that the army -- or almost any other institution that has successfully integrated in recent years -- has followed the laissez-faire approach that abandons all remnants of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which is now espoused by many conservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One good example is the U.S. Military Academy. West Point now sets a ""class composition goal"" of 7% to 9% African-American cadets every year. The last two incoming classes have been about 7.5% black. These goals are achieved by sending promising young African-Americans to the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School for a year to get them up to West Point standards. Overall, 14% of West Point's cadets attended this military prep school, but 37% of its African-Americans did. That is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, recognizing that there isn't a level playing field.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bill Republicans are pushing in Congress would outlaw nonbinding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> goals, which would do away with much of what the Army and West Point are now achieving. That's why even some conservative African-Americans, like Rep. J.C. Watts (R., Okla.), urge caution before dismantling existing programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one has navigated this tightrope better than Gen. Powell. In his autobiography, he wrote that ""preferential"" treatment ""demeans"" achievement, but where discrimination has existed ""it is only fair to provide temporary means"" to catch up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week in an interview, Mr. Powell says the issue has nothing do with him but rather with where we are as a society and what works. ""Some of my friends take only the first part of what I wrote and conclude, `see, he's against preferences.' But that was very difficult to write and I nuanced it very carefully. We had a preference system for over 200 years that did not include black people.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is essential now, he says, ""is to get away from the inflammatory stuff that shuts down dialogue. Let's stop saying that everyone on one side is a racist. Let's stop saying that all preferences are bad when we live in a system of preferences. We go to court over preferences if someone is black but not if they get a preference because their parents went to that school.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Clinton's initiative can help tame such inflammatory rhetoric, that alone will be a useful exercise.</p></div>"		1		4

Lockett knew that's why Tribbett, a respected civic leader and executive at search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, was vetting her to join the board of one of the city's largest cultural institutions, and she had no qualms about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I thought it was wonderful, because when you look at the composition of board membership across our most treasured institutions, the diversity is abysmal,"" Lockett said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Chicago's nonprofits it's been an issue for a long time: How to recruit more (and different) minority representatives to boards when the pool of candidates who have the big job titles and wealth is still too small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So for the last three years, about $400,000 has been spent placing nine highly qualified minorities, including Lockett, on the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits. Funded by the Joyce Foundation, Chicago-based Boeing Co. and The Chicago Community Trust, the program, called IMPACT, ended in December after 13 of the city's 25 largest institutions agreed to consider nominees from outside ""the usual suspects"" -- not from their immediate social network, said Peter Kuntz, the executive director of the Arts & Business Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Many of the city's civic boards relied on a very small number of minority leaders who were well known by the establishment -- Valerie Jarrett, Desiree Rogers, Tina Tchen,"" said Adele Simmons, the former president of the MacArthur Foundation. ""When they went to Washington (to serve in the Obama administration), they left a lot of vacancies.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz said that these large institutions frequently reported, ""We just don't know how to find these people."" Searching for ""a whole new group hiding in plain sight,"" Kuntz says, takes time. Furthermore, white men dominate corporate board rooms, which are the most fruitful recruiting ground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""A dream board is to have the CEO of every large corporation in Chicago,"" said Maureen Smith, one of the city's most active philanthropists. ""Because what we want are people with such seniority in their company that they can make a giving decision on their own, and don't have to ask someone up the ladder.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the IMPACT candidates were required to meet annual giving requirements, which ranged from $3,000 to $25,000. But it is never that simple, insiders say. Is there an unspoken, higher standard? Some minorities have departed boards, bitterly, after organizations abruptly enforced what previously were flexible standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid such conflicts, Ellen Alberding, the CEO of the Joyce Foundation, turned to Tribbett. Tribbett, who is black, says that ""seasoned"" minorities like himself -- he serves on at least four civic boards -- ""are all almost tapped out. There is a need for a new generation.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tribbett agreed to take on the project pro bono and assigned one of his employees, Lyndon Taylor, to help oversee the process. Taylor ultimately became a participant in the program, joining the board of Hubbard Street Dance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Everyone we placed was a peer,"" Taylor said. ""There was no <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz justifies spending a large amount of money to find nine people by saying that he expects a snowball effect. These nine will be able to recruit more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the search began, the Arts & Business Council spent a year trying to persuade the institutions to join the program. More than half declined. Some said they were doing fine on their own; others didn't have any board openings. The recession forced a handful of recruits to withdraw, but of those who remained, all were voted onto six boards. The group includes seven blacks, one Hispanic and one Native American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I kind of worked under the operating sense that Russell Reynolds and others wouldn't go to all this effort if we just looked at it as sort of a shopping list and said, 'Eh, I don't think so,' "" said Charles Katzenmeyer, vice president for external affairs at the Adler Planetarium, which added Kathy Hannan, a national managing partner at KPMG, and Lockett to its board through the program.

ANALYSIS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The presidential race in many ways can now be reduced to this: a contest between the lovers and the haters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lovers are those who hold great affection for George W. Bush, his philosophy of government, his socially conservative beliefs and his resolve on issues like Iraq and the war on terrorism. The haters are those who can't stand the president for precisely the same reasons. There hasn't been a grand embrace of challenger John Kerry, and even in the waning days before the election, a Kerry agenda is still not easy to define.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the country were electing a debater in chief, after three rounds, most would give the title to the Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His performances were more even and consistent, his presentation of facts and command of issues more clear. On this night, his burden was obvious: to persuade people to deny the president a second term, to point out with precision what the haters hate most.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The motivation to vote against someone is often more powerful than the desire to vote for someone, and in that sense, the president faces a perilous finish to the campaign. He will be relying on his legion of lovers and hope that the haters have hit the wall. He is still stoking the energy of Republican partisans, painting Kerry with the familiar ""out of the mainstream"" brush, while Kerry seems to believe there are still people to be won over in the increasingly small lane in the middle of the road, especially undecided women voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 90-minute session focused almost entirely on the issues that form the fault lines of American politics--abortion, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay marriage, faith, taxes and the role of government in health care and education. On each of those issues, the debate served to outline distinct differences between the two men.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clear choice</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of all the things that voters might say they lack when they cast ballots in November, a clear choice should not be one of them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incumbent president in a time of war and a troubled economy faced the greater challenge to defend his record. There were simply more targets for Kerry to attack. But the president also played on the dangers the nation faces as part of his contention that a chance for Kerry is not a chance worth taking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the president was put on the defensive several times, especially about the economy. Asked what he might say to a worker who had lost a job to outsourcing to a foreign country with lower wages, the president responded that education was the best kind of government jobs program in the long run. How that will play in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Missouri, which have lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, is unclear.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry repeatedly played to a theme of class warfare that has been a Democratic staple since Franklin Roosevelt, but without Roosevelt's rhetorical gifts for empathy. Kerry also sounded echoes of Bill Clinton (""people who work hard and play by the rules""), but his style would never be confused with Clinton's either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Social issues</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On social issues, the president was far clearer in ways that will no doubt help him energize Republican partisans, but might be unlikely to win over many in the shrinking pool of undecided voters. He said he didn't know if homosexuality were a ""choice"" as opposed to a birthright, but he reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In addition, he refused the chance to say that a woman had a constitutional right to choice on abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That provided a clear opening to Kerry to appeal to women voters, whom polls suggest have been gravitating toward the Democrat since the first debate in Coral Gables, Fla., last month. Kerry said he would only support a justice to the Supreme Court who believed in the constitutional right to an abortion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Loaded lines</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each candidate clearly entered the debate with a couple of loaded lines that they were ready to fire off at an appropriate moment. Neither man's effort was particularly successful, but the president's almost-forced efforts to caricature Kerry as a Massachusetts liberal to the left of Sen. Ted Kennedy appeared to fall decidedly flat, except to the hard-core partisans who can never hear enough of that kind of talk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They no doubt also enjoyed Bush's dig at the integrity of the major broadcast network news operations. For his part, Kerry's analogy to Tony Soprano is unlikely to be part of any permanent debate highlight reel either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Winning the presidency, of course, is about much more than winning a debate and the personal connection that a candidate makes has become fundamentally important in the age of television.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president offered more personal warmth than he had in the other debates, particularly when discussing his wife, Laura. Kerry still cannot match Bush's ability to make a personal connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the night of this final debate, he seemed to be quite conscious of a steady, dispassionate gaze at Kerry when he was talking, and of keeping his own voice lower. His supporters like it when he shows a little fight and fire, though.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Al Gore's biggest mistake of his presidential campaign in 2000 might well have been that he offered three different personas in his three debates with George Bush. Bush was no Gore in that respect, but he did seem to adjust his style from one debate to the next.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry has used the three debates to great advantage, especially relative to the president, gaining credibility with each. The president righted himself in the second debate in St. Louis and did little to hurt or distinguish himself in Tempe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Final national plea</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wednesday's debate in Tempe likely signaled the last big national moment of the campaign, the final time when millions of Americans paid intense attention to the race. The candidates are likely to revert to rote of their stump speeches and the grind of travel from tarmac to tarmac, narrowcast to hit as many select television markets as possible. Good morning, Dayton. Good morning, Des Moines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incumbents who don't win debates, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, haven't fared well on Election Day. There is a presumption in the electorate that presidents are supposed to be able to perform on television under pressure.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are supposed to be able not only to defend their term in office but to persuade that they deserve another. The president has three more weeks to make that case.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush and Sen.

Northern Virginia today offers a snapshot of how <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, intended as a benevolent effort to prevent discrimination, has hardened into an ugly war on achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest fuss was kicked off before Christmas when Asra Nomani, an India-born mom and reporter, wrote a piece for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal detailing how her son's Virginia high school never informed him he'd been recognized by the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology -- known as ""TJ"" and regularly ranked America's No. 1 high school -- said they had the same experience. So Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares launched a civil-rights investigation on Jan. 4. Days later, principals at two more Fairfax County high schools, Westfield and Langley, admitted they too had failed to inform student award winners.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Miyares then expanded his investigation to all Fairfax County. No sooner had he done so than neighboring Loudoun County reported that three of its high schools had delayed notifying its students -- though officials insisted it wasn't intentional. On Friday, four more Fairfax high schools fessed up, followed by another on Monday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The National Merit Scholarship Program is a competition of 1.5 million students, based on their scores on the Preliminary Standard Achievement Test/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. ""Commended Students"" rank in the top 3%, while ""Semifinalists"" test in the top 1%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's an achievement that can make a difference on a college or scholarship application. But the kids who weren't told they were National Merit winners, or were told too late, couldn't include it on their applications.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given that the program leaves notifications up to the individual schools, it's possible that all these failures were bureaucratic snafus. But the context offers a less generous reading. Public education in Fairfax County has become the front line for an equity agenda that has hardened into a war on achievers, who are disproportionately Asian-American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a federal judge pointed out in 2022 in a case contesting TJ's new admissions policy, the Fairfax County School Board eliminated the merit-based entrance exam to make room for African-American and Hispanic students by reducing the number of Asian-Americans. In that sense it ""worked.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The class admitted before the change was 73.05% Asian-American, 3.29% Hispanic and 1.23% African-American. After the change, these figures went to 54.36%, 11.27% and 7.09%, respectively. The share of white students grew from 17.70% to 22.36%.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meantime, in October district officials signed a $455,000 contract for strategic planning with consultant Mutiu Fagbayi of Performance Fact Inc. A PowerPoint presentation he'd already delivered at a September 2022 Fairfax County School Board retreat defines equity as ""equal outcomesfor every student,without exception.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or consider Shawnna Yashar, another TJ mom, whose son wasn't told he was a commended student until after the deadline for his early admissions application. Ms. Yashar says that when she complained to TJ's director of student services, Brandon Kosatka, he told her that the school wants ""to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,"" and that it delayed informing winners to spare the feelings of those who didn't qualify.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard not to notice that those who paid the price for this approach were overwhelmingly Asian-American, judging by the names on the National Merit Semifinalists' list published by Fairfax County. Asian-Americans at TJ accounted for 101 of the 132 winners, or 77%. At Langley it was 10 of 15 (66%), and for Westfield it was four of five (80%).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asian-Americans make up only 18.97% of the student population of the Fairfax County public schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes Asian-American achievement so resented by our equity warriors is that it exposes as false the narrative about an irredeemably racist America where minorities can't succeed. This progressive disdain for Asian-Americans is amplified by a resentment of moms and dads who believe they should have a say in their kids' educations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Virginia, parents watched teachers unions agitate to keep classrooms closed during Covid. They learned the National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration to regard angry parents who showed up to public meetings demanding accountability as domestic terrorists. And they heard a schools superintendent in Loudoun County lying to them about a brutal sexual assault of a 15-year-girl in a school bathroom.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now these same officials want parents, especially Asian-American parents, to believe that not informing their children that they won a prestigious academic competition was an innocent oversight. We'll see what the attorney general finds. But nothing these school officials have done has earned them a presumption of trust.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p></div>"		1			1

Rather, it tries to achieve a different apportionment of existing opportunities. It's the classic zero sum game.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> does not reduce the disparities between those at the top and everyone else. It effectively accepts those disparities and looks instead at whether the racial, ethnic and gender makeup of the people who hold coveted positions fairly reflects the makeup of society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> is different from traditional redistributive programs, most of which involve spending sums of money. With the old-fashioned programs, you can split differences with relative ease. If we're arguing about how much money to spend to help the handicapped, the unemployed, the elderly or the very poor, you and I might propose different amounts. It's not so hard to agree on a number in between, or to compromise on how the taxes to pay for such programs should be apportioned.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But you can't split differences so easily with <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, because by definition it's applied to each individual job or college spot. Either you get it, or the other guy (or woman) gets it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the older redistributive programs defined groups not in terms of who they were (African Americans, women, Latinos), but rather by what their condition was (for example, orphans, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick, students in need of scholarships). Anyone -- of either gender, of any color, of any ethnic group -- might fall into the second set of categories. Programs for the poor or the unemployed may well set off fights between the lucky and the unlucky, the rich and the not-so-rich. But these are not fixed categories. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span>, on the other hand, rests on fixed definitions of which group you belong to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the above might be taken as an argument against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. If one's central concern is for a more equitable society, it would seem to make sense to direct government-backed efforts not toward entire racial or gender groups but toward all those, no matter what group they belong to, who need the most help. Surely, for example, it makes more sense to direct resources and preferences to impoverished inner-city kids and not to the sons and daughters of the well-off in the black community. And it doesn't seem to make sense to give, say, the daughter of the president of a steel company a preference over the son of a white janitor at the same steel company. Cases like that may not be typical, but they are relevant to the issue of whether <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is always just.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But matters do not stop there. The reason this issue is so hard was summarized by the sociologist Steven Lukes in a brilliant adage. ""Every way of seeing,"" he once wrote, ""is also a way of not seeing."" So, for example, if you focus only on the injustices of class, you might well miss the injustices of race or gender. It is perfectly reasonable for an African American, even an affluent African American, to argue that the burden of discrimination he or she faces is qualitatively different from what might be faced by the white janitor's son. After all, the United States has been firmly committed by law to racial equality for only 31 of the 208 years that have passed since the adoption of a Constitution that permitted slavery. There is, to put it mildly, a lot of catching up to do, and the country clearly has an interest in making sure that African Americans have a good chance of inclusion at all levels of society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nathan Glazer, a sociologist who has been one of the most articulate opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, surprised many with an op-ed article in the Wall Street Journal last week warning that simply wiping out <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> could have disastrous consequences. ""I am concerned,"" he wrote, ""that African-Americans will see the abandonment of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for them as a terrible rejection by an indifferent and hostile society."" Would they be entirely wrong?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the coming <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debate is to be something other than demagogic, each side needs to honor the other's truths. Opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> need to recognize that the standard they espouse, ""equality of opportunity,"" is not nearly as simple as it sounds. Guaranteeing equality of opportunity as between a very poor African American in the inner city and a well-off white suburbanite is a very big commitment involving all sorts of interventions (from prenatal care to adequate policing to decent schools). If you're for equality of opportunity, you have to be in favor of doing a lot more than is now being done to achieve it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> have to understand its limits. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> is doing very little to help those inner-city kids whose problems are now the largest cause of racial inequality. And supporters of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> should not write off as racism or sexism the concerns that whites of modest means have over what <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> might do to their children's chances of advancement. Such concerns are rooted in rational worries about economic conditions that may make their kids' way harder than it would have been 30 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton is thinking about naming a blue-ribbon commission to study <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. If the commission is going to hand out a moralistic report telling us all how to think, it shouldn't waste its time. But if it sees its job as broadening the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> debate to a discussion of how to ensure something closer to equality of opportunity -- for an inner- city child and that white janitor's son alike -- it might do some good.</p></div>"		1							2
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408354994.xml.txt	"<div><p>The University of Michigan Case</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JENNIFER GRATZ'S lawsuit challenging the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy is a win-win proposition for opponents of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs and a significant headache for their defenders. If Ms. Gratz prevails in the lower courts, the university could be forced to dismantle its program, joining public universities in California and Texas that have adopted race-blind admissions policies and then seen minority enrollments plummet. On the other hand, if Ms. Gratz loses, foes of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> will have the opportunity to challenge the race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court at a time when the high court is notably unfriendly to <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> generally.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Gratz, who is represented pro bono by the conservative Center for Individual Rights, claims she was discriminated against when she was wait-listed and later turned down by Michigan two years ago because she is white. On its face, she appears to have a strong case. University admissions guidelines seem to instruct admissions officers to handle minority applications differently from those of white applicants, laying out a dual set of standards that could raise a constitutional problem under the Supreme Court's 1978 case University of California Regents v. Bakke. In Bakke, the court allowed race to be a factor in admissions but said it could not preclude any candidate from receiving full consideration. That is precisely what Ms. Gratz alleges happened to her, because the guidelines suggest that comparably qualified minority candidates generally should be admitted. These are disturbing guidelines, and it is significant that the university has since changed its admissions system to one that would be easier to defend under Bakke.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, it would be premature to pass judgment on a complex admissions system before all the evidence is in. It is difficult to demonstrate that any one student was rejected because of race as opposed to the myriad other factors that influence admissions at a large university, and the University of Michigan gives preferential treatment to students on bases other than race. Students from certain counties in Michigan get preferential treatment, for example, as do students whose parents are Michigan alumni. It is not logical to suggest that race can be a factor in admissions but can never play a decisive role in an individual admissions decision. Even a program that meets the Bakke test, in other words, is going to produce certain white victims -- like, perhaps, Ms. Gratz -- so the mere fact that such victims exist cannot necessarily mean that the program is constitutionally deficient.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The larger question, of course, is whether Bakke even remains the law of the land. Normally, the courts wait for the Supreme Court to renounce one of its own rulings before declaring the ruling dead. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit paid the high court no such deference when it ruled last year that the University of Texas could not use race as a factor in law school admissions. This was, in our judgment, a bad decision that jumped the gun on an important constitutional question. But it is also possible that the decision in Hopwood v. Texas correctly anticipated the direction that the Supreme Court, which declined to review the case, eventually will go on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in education. It is not obvious that this will be the case, however. While the court has narrowed the acceptable uses of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in recent years, the public university is a unique environment -- constitutionally as well as culturally. Allowing a university to foster diversity by factoring race into admissions decisions under certain narrow circumstances still seems to be a constitutional approach.</p></div>"		1		4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/430872205.xml.txt	"<div><p>Violins In the Wings</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''You have to distinguish between means and ends,'' Albert Carnesale said. ''What's important here is the end, diversity. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> is just one means to that end.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Carnesale is the new Chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, a great public university in a diverse city. He moved here in July from Harvard, where he was dean of the Kennedy School and then provost. He arrived at a turning point for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new policy of the Regents of the University of California, effective this year at the graduate school level, forbids giving preference in admissions on the basis of race or ethnicity. Proposition 209, which has just gone into effect, makes that a rule for all state institutions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result of the Regents' policy, the number of Hispanic and black students at the U.C.L.A. Law School has dropped sharply. Last year 104 blacks were admitted, this year 21. Of the 21, only 8 enrolled. (At Boalt Hall, the University of California Law School at Berkeley, none of the black students admitted this year actually came.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Al Carnesale, figures like those -- and what they indicate may happen in undergraduate admissions -- represent a profound challenge. He outlined three reasons he believes diversity is essential to U.C.L.A. fulfilling its responsibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''First,'' he said, ''we have to provide the best possible education for our students. And I have no doubt that education is markedly advanced by diversity -- because students learn from each other. Teaching foreign policy at Harvard, I saw it at work. The differences in perspectives were so informative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Second, it is our responsibility to prepare leaders for all segments of our society. We are a public university. And the way to do that is to provide high-quality education for potential leaders in all groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''Third, one of the things that sets the United States apart is access to social and economic mobility. And the key to that is education. Go around the table at a meeting of business leaders, and half the stories you hear will have violins playing in the background.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Carnesale feels strongly about that, it is because his own story has plenty of violins in the background. He was brought up in a Bronx tenement near Yankee Stadium, the son of a taxi driver, and then lived the American dream: Bronx High School of Science, nuclear engineer, adviser to Presidents on arms control.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''What can we do to maintain diversity now?'' he asked. ''We can encourage minority students whose records make them eligible to apply, and then encourage those admitted to enroll. We have to make sure people know they're welcome. In fact, the message is that they're wanted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In the medium term, we have to get more minorities eligible. It means we have to be much more engaged in the high schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In the long run, there has to be something like equal opportunity for all kids to get a good education in this country. Better-off people will always have an advantage, but equal opportunity should be a goal, an aspiration.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The passage of Proposition 209 may make people think that California now requires the university to admit students solely on the basis of academic scores. That is not so. In fact, the rules require that at least 25 percent of each class admitted reflect qualities apart from school records and test results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''We use <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> all the time,'' Mr. Carnesale said. ''It is not by looking at academic merits alone that we have a football team with a 9-2 record, going to a bowl.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''In going over applications for admission you notice that applicants come from different countries, or this one plays the cello, or that one is a published poet or has overcome great personal obstacles in her life. We may notice all those things -- but not race or ethnicity or gender.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact is that, in California and everywhere, values apart from test scores do figure in university admissions policies -- and should. A society that has prospered in diversity cannot want monochrome higher education.</p></div>"		1							2
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1667204395.xml.txt	"<div><p>Divestment isn'the answer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest stock holdings are again on the rise, focused today more often than not on holdings in fossil fuel companies. Many of the arguments against divestment as a general tactic are by now well known. They include practical ones, such as the difficulty of divesting fully when portfolios contain index funds, hedge funds and other complex instruments; concerns about adverse effects on the ability of endowments to support education and research as fully as they could if they were unconstrained; and doubts about the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about changes (which are often unspecified) in corporate practice. In general, I find these objections persuasive, though they need to be tested and debated in each situation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One argument in favor of divestment that I find entirely unpersuasive is the claim that a university is obligated to take a stand on any issue of broad social import that individuals - including, not infrequently, the president of a university acting in citizen mode! - regard as highly consequential. This is nonsense. To abstain is both a legitimate and appropriate action when the issue is not central to an institution's educational mission. Universities need to keep control over their agendas and decide for themselves when it is appropriate to take a position. An issue such as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> - which directly affects educational processes and outcomes - has a very different claim on academia than does the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taking an institutional stand on political issues of many kinds threatens the primary educational mission of the university, which is to be avowedly open to arguments of every kind and to avoid giving priority to partisan or other political viewpoints. The university should be the home of the critic - indeed, the home of critics of many different persuasions - not the critic itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But my main quarrel with current debates over divestment is that they pay too little attention, if any attention at all, to what I regard as the insidious moral perils of divestment. There is, first of all, the sometime hypocrisy of seeking institutional ""purity"" while failing individually to reduce consumption of fossil fuels or, for a faculty member, to divest one's personal stake in investment vehicles, including index funds, that contain questionable holdings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, with regard to endowments, there is the question of an institution's obligation, seen as a matter of trust, to honor the intent of donors - many of whom surely gave money to endow specific activities, such as scholarships, believing that the institution would seek to earn as large a return as it prudently could.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, there is the very real danger that, as Macalester College President Brian Rosenberg has explained so well, joining the crowd in pushing for an institutional position on issues such as fossil fuels is too easy; it can tempt individuals to substitute such ""easy"" actions for their responsibility to act as citizens in pursuing more difficult courses of action, including working tirelessly in the political process. Of course, one can do both, but one wonders how often that happens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, these are times when educational institutions need to work harder, in my view, to improve educational outcomes, especially for less-privileged students. A related obligation is to seek new ways of controlling educational costs to address affordability issues that will not be solved, I suspect, by increased governmental support. At the institutional level, there are only so many dollars to spend, and only so many hours in the day to work on issues of consequence. Well- intentioned but poorly conceived efforts to compel colleges and universities to fight extramural battles of all kinds can impair efforts to work harder on issues of great social as well as educational consequence that are at the core of the basic educational mission of higher education. Such trade-offs receive too little - and sometimes no - consideration. And there is a slippery slope to be considered - divesting for one purpose can make it harder for the institution to resist other calls to use divestment as a political tactic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Searching for answers to the question of how to make one's greatest contribution to the common good is anything but easy, for institutions or for individuals. But it should be at the forefront of our thinking - not an afterthought.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W.

Once a certain threshold is achieved, for much of their history colleges gave “extra points” to certain students, because their family members were alums, because a student excelled at a niche sport, because their wealthy parents made a significant donation or because they hailed from an underrepresented state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact that these legacies, scions, athletes and geographic admissions were almost always of the same race and similar socioeconomic classes was deemed unremarkable. In the late 1960s, in pursuit of a more diverse higher education experience, and to redress prior unexamined biases, schools began shifting some of these extra points toward students of color and students who were economically disadvantaged. Occasionally, students who excelled in tiny towns or at different sports were recognized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For generations a wide array of students has benefited from “<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.” Yet today, for some reason, it’s only the black and brown students who get labeled as such.

To address this problem less cynically, we should explicitly include a second dimension to our <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> efforts, based on economic status.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I believe that if we did, Mr. Trump would find a less receptive audience for his intentional divisiveness.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MICHAEL FARZAN, JUNO BEACH, FLA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the Editor:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is high time we began to treat African-Americans and Latinos as equals when applying to college as well as all other arenas in life.

Make no mistake about it. Remember that the Southern states insisted that they were not fighting to preserve the institution of slavery, but that they were fighting to preserve and protect states' rights. And now Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and others have done just that. They have turned over the entire bundle of civil rights to the states. Oh, it hasn't happened yet, but you can see the state legislatures scrambling to undo civil rights legislation as we speak. It won't be long, as people are speculating, before gay rights, students' rights, immigrants' rights and others are taken away, just as a fundamental women's right has been.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Frankly, I fear that this eviscerating of civil rights won't stop until the states have revoked Brown v. Board of Education. Then the clock will rewind until we arrive at 1896 and Plessy v. Ferguson. Separate but equal. And a new era of Jim Crow.

Women had virtually no rights in 1868, and Title IX is a mere 50 years old, so there are no deep roots protecting it. If it is challenged and the case reaches the Supreme Court, would the court apply the same rationale to Title IX as it did with the Roe v. Wade repeal for the sake of consistency? If so, Title IX could be in serious jeopardy. It would be horrible to see Title IX fall, but, based on the rationale for overturning Roe v.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/398469346.xml.txt	"<div><p>A GOP star becomes 'one of them'</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Weld instantly became a shining star in the Republican firmament when he succeeded Michael Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts in 1990, proving that a Republican could indeed win in the most liberal of states. Since then, Gov. Weld has tried to become a beacon for those outside the party mainstream by combining fiscal conservatism (complete with a ""no new taxes"" pledge) with social libertarianism (he's to the left of Joycelyn Elders on abortion). Now Gov. Weld has taken his most ambitious steps toward marketing his vision of Republicanism nationally by backing the presidential campaign of California Gov. Pete Wilson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But just as Gov. Weld tries to exert his influence beyond Massachusetts, he's losing his luster at home. Since winning reelection with more than 70% of the vote last fall, Gov. Weld has managed to alienate many of his core backers. In particular, many of the conservative Democrats who crossed party lines to support him -- the ""Weldocrats"" -- feel betrayed by a governor who reminds them more of Nelson Rockefeller than of Ronald Reagan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In December, Mr. Weld endured the most hostile public reaction of his career when he approved a thoroughly unpopular pay raise for state legislators. The Boston Herald filled page one with a derisive sketch of Mr. Weld as Santa, dropping presents down the State House chimney.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, Santa again sided with an unpopular special interest. State taxpayers are sick of the only-in-Massachusetts law which requires that off-duty cops be hired to oversee road work at twice the cost of regular flagmen. This mandate costs fiscally strapped cities and towns $100 million annually. But Mr. Weld ignored the mounting clamor for reform, saying, ""I'm with the cops on this one.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barbara Anderson, a top antitax leader in the Bay State, has broken with Mr. Weld over such cave-ins. ""He's now become one of them,"" she says, ""sort of like the pod people.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the governor's credibility as a reformer has deteriorated to the point where the recent announcement of a new executive branch downsizing initiative was widely ridiculed as a publicity stunt. These days, Boston's radio talk shows are full of anti-Weld venom of the sort unheard since Mr. Dukakis left office. The governor's frequent out-of-town trips to raise funds for Mr. Wilson's campaign have become a local joke; one radio station even sent its morning team out in search of citizens who'd actually seen the governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ultimate insult to the Weldocrats came on June 17, when Mr. Weld delivered a ringing endorsement of the <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> status quo to stunned parents at graduation ceremonies for Northeastern University, a commuter school favored by working-class whites. ""We don't discard [the taxation or defense-procurement systems] when we see an individual application we don't like . . . because we understand the systems are there for a necessary purpose,"" reasoned Mr. Weld. ""Same goes for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one former Weld campaign worker the speech was the final straw. ""The political culture he vowed to change instead changed him,"" he moans. ""When it comes to Bill Weld, effective term limits probably would have been one term.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What happened? Mr. Weld fancies himself a new strain of politically marketable Republican, his conservatism on taxes and crime made palatable for socially progressive baby boomers by his liberalism on abortion, gay rights, and environmental affairs. For a while, Mr. Weld's approach worked. He won general plaudits for cutting 7,000 state jobs and pushing for privatization of state services and a death penalty.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with re-election safely in hand, the blue-blooded governor has revealed a palpable distaste for the indignities of populism and the impoliteness of the bully pulpit. He counts House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a friend, but has none of Mr. Gingrich's appetite for the grubby work of ideological leadership and party-building.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Weld won his party's nomination in 1990 despite opposition from its right-wing establishment, some of it quite nasty. Consequently, he ignored the party after taking office. Without leadership from atop, the GOP fared poorly in both the 1992 and 1994 legislative elections, dropping enough state Senate seats to lose the ability to sustain any Weld veto. One direct consequence was a successful Democratic override of Mr. Weld's 1993 veto of union-backed legislation bringing his privatization initiatives to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Weld regaled talk-radio audiences with tough talk on crime and his self-description as ""a filthy supply-sider."" But Gov. Weld has done little to push supply-side tax cuts. The lone significant trophy, a five-year phase-out of the tax on long-term capital gains, was won not as the result of a public campaign extolling supply-side principles, but as a direct swap for the much-reviled legislators' pay hike. Public outrage over that bit of insider-trading flushed Mr. Weld out for a round of awkward damage-control attempts on the talk shows, where he seemed quite stunned at the near-unanimous disdain of Weldocrats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other areas, Mr. Weld's inside game has been even less successful. For instance, his cursory lobbying efforts have not yet led to the passage of a death penalty bill despite 80% support from the public. Republicans, such as the seven GOP representatives who deserted Mr. Weld on the capital punishment vote, feel little pressure from him to maintain party discipline; the Democrats increasingly see no reason to hide their contempt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than rub elbows with dreary legislators and demanding constituents, Mr. Weld seems to prefer the counsel of the legal and business cronies he cultivated during his years as a downtown lawyer and U.S. Attorney.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A 1990 campaign vow to remove televisions from state prison cells was quickly discarded under criticism from Democratic law enforcement officials and Mr. Weld's downtown friends. Among a panoply of conservative criminal-justice reforms promised by the candidate, only those with strong support within the Democratic establishment -- such as a long-overdue truth-in-sentencing law -- have materialized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Weld won't dip into his political capital for a death penalty or serious tort reform, but he will risk Weldocrat goodwill by commuting the life-without-parole sentence of murderer Joseph Yandle, a Vietnam veteran whose supposedly impressive rehabilitation was sympathetically profiled on ""60 Minutes"" and has been a liberal cause celebre. Few Weldocrats need much prodding to recall Mr. Dukakis's furlough of vicious murderer-rapist Willie Horton. The question is: Does Mr. Weld remember?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Weldocrats find the governor increasingly oblivious to their agenda, liberal elites find him a receptive audience. Mr. Weld claims his lunge to the left on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> was prompted by a visit from Flash Wiley, an African-American businessman and longtime Democratic activist. ""They're old friends,"" said Mr. Weld of Mr. Wiley and his wife. ""When people like them say that when you're a minority contractor, you have to be twice as good, you've got to listen.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what of the white Weldocrat contractors, shunted by the state's politically correct <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> policies to the back of the line for public contracts? ""I've listened to the claims and assertions for six months about this terrible resentment of white males, and I'm not buying it,"" Mr. Weld told the Boston Globe. ""These are phony assertions. The bottom line is that blacks are twice as unemployed as whites. You have a pretty crushing rationale [for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>] . . . and all the arguments against it you should disregard.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Weldocrats, like their counterparts nationally, are a brittle bunch. As both Bill Clinton and Ross Perot have discovered, their faith in the reformer of the moment is easily shattered. Mislead them on a crucial issue, as George Bush's lips did, and they begin to look elsewhere for hope. Mr. Weld offered the promise that the government would acknowledge their values and address their agony. Instead, his abandonment of them offers a warning to voters elsewhere about the integrity of new-age fusion Republicanism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Keller is a political analyst for WLVI-TV, Channel 56, in Boston.</p></div>"									2

Its answer, with some important caveats, has always been yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was wise to reaffirm this principle on Thursday, ruling 4 to 3 in favor of an admissions process at the University of Texas at Austin that weighs race as one of many factors in filling some spots in its first-year class. The decision was the strongest reaffirmation of the constitutionality of a race-conscious approach in more than a decade, and should be the defining judgment on this issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court has acknowledged over and over that universities have a compelling interest in achieving the social and educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body. But that precedent has remained under constant attack. The current case was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied admission in 2008 and argued that the university violated the Constitution's equal protection clause by discriminating against white applicants.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Texas uses two separate methods to achieve greater diversity: First, it automatically offers roughly three-quarters of its spots to students who graduated in the top 10 percent of every high school in the state. (This helps increase diversity because so many Texas high schools are either overwhelmingly white or minority.) The remaining quarter is filled using a ""holistic"" process that considers various factors, including an applicant's leadership qualities, talents, socioeconomic status and race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, rejected Ms. Fisher's arguments and said, ""Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Justice Kennedy cautioned that a university's goals ""must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them,"" and that officials must continue to monitor and change those policies if necessary.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(Only seven justices participated in the ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself because of her prior involvement in the litigation as solicitor general; Justice Antonin Scalia, who heard oral arguments in the case in December, died in February.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court considered Texas' holistic approach once before, in 2013, but declined then to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it sent the case back to the federal appeals court to examine more closely the university's rationale for considering race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That type of examination is exactly what the university did, in providing data showing that race-neutral policies were inadequate in achieving a diverse student body, and that the holistic approach made a significant difference. In fact, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, the university has been adjusting its use of race in admissions for 20 years. It developed its current approach in direct response to a 2003 Supreme Court ruling upholding the same process at the University of Michigan law school.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some justices continue to reject any consideration of race in college admissions. Justice Clarence Thomas dismissed the idea that students benefit from a racially diverse learning environment as a ""fchangeish theory."" Justice Samuel Alito spent 50 pages -- more than twice the length of the majority opinion -- disputing every rationale offered by the university and its supporters. ""This is <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> gone wild,"" he wrote, and argued that the top 10 percent plan produced enough diversity on its own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that plan, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissent from the 2013 decision, is itself race conscious, since it relies on the existing and extreme segregation of Texas high schools. The holistic approach, on the other hand, considers race as a ""factor of a factor of a factor of a factor.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some insist simplistically that America is already a colorblind society or, even more perversely, that ending race-conscious policies would lead the way to such a society. Fortunately, Justice Kennedy, who has long  been a strong skeptic of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span> programs, rejected that view. His vote in the Fisher case assures that universities will continue to have the right to shape their student bodies in a way that better reflects today's America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Lisk Feng)</p></div>"		1		4

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1652232593.xml.txt	"<div><p>The Best Way to Address Campus Rape</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE campus rape debate took another hairpin turn last week when The Daily Beast published an interview with Paul Nungesser, the Columbia student accused of raping a fellow student, Emma Sulkowicz. She has been carrying a mattress around the campus to raise awareness about sexual assault and to protest the school's failure to expel Mr. Nungesser, who was cleared by a campus tribunal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The article raised questions about her story; among other things, it included screen shots from Mr. Nungesser's Facebook account showing that he and Ms. Sulkowicz had traded mutually affectionate messages for weeks after the incident in question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, the Columbia Daily Spectator published two columns wondering whether the paper had been too quick to assume Mr. Nungesser's guilt. Ms. Sulkowicz's supporters and some bloggers denounced The Daily Beast for conducting a trial by media and for posting the Facebook pages, which they said added nothing to the story unless you believed that a rape survivor who didn't behave like the perfect victim had to be a liar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the media has reason to retry the case. Ms. Sulkowicz herself sought out the media when Columbia exonerated Mr. Nungesser. And the media made Ms. Sulkowicz so well known as a rape survivor that Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, invited her to the State of the Union address and publicly declared that she had received ""no justice."" Very few people, and almost no one in the media, thought to question that assertion, because everyone knows, just knows, that you can't trust a campus sexual assault proceeding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What explains the nearly universal lack of confidence in these proceedings? Universities share some of the blame, but there's another culprit too: the United States government. People often wonder why college administrators try to adjudicate these fiendishly difficult cases, rather than putting them in the hands of the criminal justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason is that the Department of Education has very forcefully told schools to handle sexual grievances themselves and given them very detailed instructions about how to do so. A report last year from a White House task force on campus sexual assault underscored the importance to a university of following that advice. Even though the D.O.E.'s instructions are presented as recommendations rather than law, its Office for Civil Rights can put any school that fails to follow them on the list of colleges under investigation and even take away its federal funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no doubt that on many occasions colleges have not treated sexual-assault accusations as seriously as they should have. Nor did they do enough to ensure that women felt completely safe on campus. But in the past half-decade, the civil rights office has tried so hard to correct that problem that it is now forcing schools to go too far in the other direction, which has made campus procedures seem even less credible. Schools are being told to disregard what most Americans think of as the basic civil rights of a person accused of a heinous act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other things, schools have to determine guilt on the basis of a ""preponderance of"" rather than ""clear and convincing"" evidence -- that is, on a 51 percent likelihood that the man did it, rather than a 75 percent one. (In these cases, the accused is almost always a man, although the accuser is by no means always a woman.) Neither party is allowed to cross-examine the other, lest direct questioning re-traumatize a victim. Schools must resolve cases swiftly -- the original requirement was 60 days, though the latest guidelines leave out the number and simply stress the need for a prompt resolution -- even if a criminal investigation is going forward at a slower pace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That puts a student who wants to defend himself at risk of saying things that could later be used against him in court -- and at many schools, he's not even allowed to let a lawyer speak for him. At least 30 male students, some of whom were suspended or expelled for sexual misconduct, have filed suits against their universities, claiming that the process was unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should universities do to convince the world that they're fit to deal with campus rape? First, they should band together and demand that the government rethink its guidelines, especially those that flout the key tenets of due process. Second, they should ask the Office for Civil Rights to clarify its notion of sexual misconduct, now left to each school to define. Is it rape if a man fails to get affirmative consent at every stage of a sexual interaction, or only if he ignores a spoken objection? If a man and a woman are equally drunk, should he be found guilty of assaulting her because she was too intoxicated to agree to sex, even though he himself may have been too drunk to know that? (Right now, at most schools, he would be considered guilty.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, universities should insist that determinations of guilt or innocence rely on a ""reasonable-person test,"" according to which the accused is only culpable if a reasonable person would have considered his actions to be wrong. Without that standard, his fate may rest on her subjective judgment -- if she feels that he imposed unwanted sexual contact on her, no matter what he actually did, then he can be found to have harassed or raped her. (Harvard's controversial new policy leaves out the reasonable-person standard, which is partly why 28 of its law professors have publicly objected to it.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth step, however, may be the most important. Though schools have the right to uphold their own standards of conduct, the government is currently scaring them into creating big, expensive bureaucracies and designing unduly cumbersome policies. Meanwhile, there are many more 18- to 25-year-old rape victims outside the walls of colleges than inside them. The smarter and more public-spirited thing for schools to do would be to divert at least some of their time and energy to forming partnerships with local law enforcement agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is widely believed that the police are insensitive to rape victims. Universities, on the whole, have a great deal of clout in their communities; they also possess considerable intellectual resources. They could be helping policemen and prosecutors do a better job with sexual violence cases instead of squandering money and good will on their own all-too-easily second-guessed shadow justice systems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JUDITH SHULEVITZ   Judith Shulevitz is the author of ""The Sabbath World: Glimpses of a Different Order of Time.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia University, On Friday.

Two years ago, he was chosen the first Latino Assembly speaker in California history. And Nov. 3, he was elected the first Latino lieutenant governor in 128 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next came Antonio Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat and onetime street kid from East L.A. Last February, he succeeded Bustamante as speaker and, in 2001, may run for L.A. mayor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now comes Rod Pacheco from Riverside, the latest Latino to move up in legislative leadership and into the hierarchy of California politics. He's different, however. He's a Republican Latino, a rarity in partisan politics, at least until recently.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After getting pounded in the election--losing a net five seats--Assembly Republicans selected Pacheco as their new leader, the first-ever Latino to lead the GOP in the lower house. In fact, when Pacheco arrived in Sacramento just two years ago, he was the first Republican Latino lawmaker in 115 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the latest sign of growing Latino political clout--to the point, now, that even Republican Latinos are getting elected to partisan office. Three more GOP Latinos won Assembly races Nov. 3, quadrupling their seats.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all, one in five members of the next Legislature will be Latino--24 total, up from 18 last session. There'll be 17 in the Assembly, seven in the Senate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And for the GOP, Pacheco's rise, plus the three new Latino lawmakers, are among the few bright spots that have emerged from a disastrous election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican party is desperate for credible messengers who can persuade Latino voters they shouldn't keep blaming the GOP for Gov. Pete Wilson's fiery crusades against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and illegal immigration, his doomsday TV ads warning that ""they keep coming.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consequently, there's considerable rooting for Pacheco within the party. The new minority leader still is an unknown--he has been a legislator only two years and nobody knows whether he can lead--but already there's speculation about a future statewide candidacy. For attorney general? Governor?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's only 40. He's a former prosecutor who didn't lose a case in 10 years and sent five murderers to death row. He's a centrist who supports abortion rights and opposed Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative. But he backed Prop. 209 to end state racial preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco's the kind of fiscally conservative, crime-fighting, social moderate who just might appeal to voters statewide. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, he pleads.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Folks have said stuff like that to me,"" Pacheco says. ""But you know how this place is: Every {legislative} member gets that--120 legislators wake up in the morning and see the next governor. That's partly their own ambition and partly everybody slapping them on the back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""No. 2, I'm not sure that's my future. I live by the motto, 'Man makes plans and God laughs.' ""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacheco believes Latinos can be drawn to the Republican party because of common views about safer streets, family values, lower taxes, less regulation and better schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the GOP wants to use him as a party recruiter of Latinos, he's uncomfortable with that. ""I don't think it's my role to carry the banner,"" he says. ""That's up to the party. My best role is just to go about my business and folks may be encouraged by the fact I'm the Republican leader.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most Latinos, Pacheco says, he opposed Prop. 187 because it targeted schoolchildren and was promoted in a harsh tone. There was some logic to eliminating public services for illegal immigrants, he explains, but ""I equate it to my days as a trial lawyer: Emotion moves people faster than logic. If I perceive I'm being attacked personally, I'm going to have difficulty relating to you in a rational and logical way.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Heading into the next legislative session, the deck's stacked against Pacheco and Republicans. They're down 48-32 in the Assembly and 25-15 in the Senate, with a Democratic governor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he says, ""We need to be assertive. There's the possibility Democrats could be giddy with the elections and think we're irrelevant. But we won't be irrelevant because any bill {requiring a two-thirds vote} will need Republicans. I didn't come here to fight. I could have stayed in the DA's office and fought. But if Democrats don't reach across the aisle, we're probably going to fight more often than not.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrat he'll be fighting with the most is another Latino, Speaker Villaraigosa. And that's a healthy sign for political diversity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a new era in California politics--more moderate and more Latino. As for Republican Latinos, the GOP can only hope ""they keep coming.""</p></div>"			3					6

A greater proportion of white women than black women, however, participated in managerial and professional training.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout most of the 1970s, black women who participated in job training programs tended to be disproportionately represented in clerical and semiskilled programs. They were consequently underrepresented in managerial and professional training programs. Our study results revealed, however, that participation in job training programs among black women eroded throughout the 1980s. As this cohort aged, black women participated less than white women in training programs. Despite this decline, however, we found no differences by type of training among participants in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, our results pointed to good and bad news regarding women's participation in job training programs throughout a significant portion of their paid working histories. On one hand, job training segregation characteristic of the 1970s evaporated in the 1980s, as black women and white women were equally as likely to participate in clerical and semiskilled programs as they were in managerial and professional programs. On the other hand, equality of access to job training programs between white women and black women characteristic in the 1970s was undermined during the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, we also found that as these women matured, the intensity of the job training experience resulted in higher wages regardless of the duration of the program and independently of a participant's educational level and work history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We believe that these results can serve to inform the current debate regarding <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. To the extent that job training increases income, thwarted access to such programs along racial lines remains problematic. Many business leaders have implemented <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs designed to increase diversity and to ensure that historical wrongs are addressed along lines of both race and gender. Our results suggest that human resource personnel still need to find ways to increase the accessibility of job training programs to black working women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are not suggesting that access be denied to some at the expense of others. Rather, our view is one of expanding the job training pie, so to speak. That is, to the extent businesses want to attract qualified and diverse personnel, the provision of on-the-job training represents an investment in human capital with tangible rewards to their employees. That such investments also increase the bottom line is not in doubt. Employers can again ensure equal access to job training programs as was the case in the 1970s, and they can do so in light of the more equitable distributive gains between unskilled-semiskilled and managerial-professional training programs made in the 1980s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In regard to individual workers, our results suggest that on-the-job training is a worthwhile pursuit. Increasingly, technology makes today's skills outdated tomorrow. Lifelong learning is an ideal whose time has come. Skill acquisition can no longer be seen as fixed. Instead, individual workers will need to seek out ways to upgrade their skills, thereby demonstrating added value beyond that of accumulated wisdom that often accompanies accumulated experience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the future, greater economic rewards are likely to go to those whose competencies change to fit the organizational profile of a valued worker. Women will be very much a part of this workplace. They need to seek both on-the-job and off-the-job training opportunities that are necessary for advancement. Black women in particular must take proactive efforts to ensure access programs commensurate with their individual aspirations and abilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We also have a responsibility to serve as role models and coaches to the next generation of women preparing to enter the workforce. Women also must share their experiences with younger women through mentoring programs. Advocating that high school girls take extra mathematical, computer science and science courses will help to prepare them for the workplace of tomorrow. Encouraging young women to pursue college degrees and to take seriously the commitment to continuing education may help to diminish the job segregation that is still too commonplace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Businesses should see on-the-job training as investments in human capital that are mutually advantageous for themselves and their workers. Of particular importance is continuous learning for mid-career employees, who may be far removed from academic life per se. Rather than creating an environment that disposes of dependable, competent workers whose specific skills may be needed less as time goes on, employers can capitalize on known quantities by providing access to job training designed to meet the changing requirements of the job. In so doing, employers should judge performance in terms of competencies and avoid channeling women into stereotypic roles or roles narrowly associated with past work histories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lower access to training and over representation in clerical programs for black women may have channeled them into jobs not commensurate with their abilities. Black women remain the most underrepresented in managerial positions. Organizations in today's competitive market do not have the luxury to waste talent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The study described in this article was published in the Human Resource Development Quarterly, Fall 1997 issue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTOS: Mary Cianni is associate professor of management at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania and Richard K.

There's consensus the U.S. has a long way to go on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""He just cut him down and cut him out.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That was the response from South Los Angeles barbershop owner Lawrence Tolliver moments after the NBA commissioner told Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to leave the building, and not just for a day or two, but for life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""The commissioner got right to the point, and I am very, very pleased,"" said Tolliver, who hopes Sterling's ban forces him to sell the team to someone who's not an embarrassment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a remarkably blunt televised news conference Tuesday morning, Sterling was repudiated and kicked to the curb for being hateful and stupid enough to have gotten caught establishing himself as a Hall of Fame bigot.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NBA chief Adam Silver said Sterling admitted that it was his voice on an audiotape scolding a female friend for Instagramming pictures of herself with black folks. He also told her not to bring any of those people to his games.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meaning NBA games, in which 8 in 10 players are African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daffy? Sick? Tawdry?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to Donald Sterling's world. It's all the loopier because the female in question is of mixed race and half a century younger than the doddering octogenarian, who is said to have set his friend up with a home near the Beverly Center and luxury cars.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let this be a reminder to one and all: Never get tangled up with anyone 50 years younger because it can only end badly.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Tolliver's clip parlor Monday, the day before Sterling was sentenced to eternal shame, the clientele was having a typically passionate, boisterous conversation on race, as Rosa Parks and Jackie Robinson looked on from their posters on the wall. It's been 67 years since Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball, 59 years since Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus, and just a few days since Sterling turned back the clock.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's remarks, fresh on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests we're ready to move beyond <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, followed those by Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy on the good old days of cotton picking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""He said we'd be better off as slaves,"" Tolliver said about Bundy. And then Sterling came along.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tolliver was particularly appalled by the part of the recording in which the man said to be Sterling talked about his players. ""He said, 'I buy their food, I buy their cars, I buy their houses. Like he's a slave owner,"" said Tolliver, who said he believes the players are nothing but tools to boost Sterling's already staggering fortune.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither Tolliver nor his customers were shocked by the revelations on the tape. They're well aware that the billionaire property owner once paid millions to settle a housing discrimination case, and he was sued unsuccessfully by onetime Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor, who said Sterling ran the Clipper operation like it was a plantation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What in the world, Tolliver demanded, had the NAACP been thinking with its plans to honor Sterling after he made a donation to the organization? The group changed its mind when the latest Sterling scandal broke, but Tolliver says Sterling's true colors were already known, and he suspects the owner's charitable donations are investments in image control rather than expressions of true compassion.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The barbershop consensus was unanimous on two points:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, that the country has made much progress on race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, that there's a long way to go, because Sterling is anything but a lone man on a tiny island.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""I've been hearing it all my life,"" said Warren Allen, a dentist and Vietnam vet. He said people frequently let loose around him -- with the N-word and more -- because he's light-skinned and they don't know he's African American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Race-baiting is alive and well, said Bishop Curtis Gadson of Amazing Grace Outreach Ministries.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""We have people on television and talk radio scaring the hell out of people,"" Gadson said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bishop grew up in the South and recalls segregated bathrooms and drinking fountains. He moved to L.A. 50 years ago and knew immediately that it was a better place. But even now, he said, he sees white people eye him suspiciously depending on the time and place.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""A whole lot of it has changed, but a whole lot of it went underground, and when Obama became president it all came back out,"" said Ron Simmons, a church elder. ""They couldn't help themselves.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For him, Sterling's remarks deserved full condemnation. He was taken back to 1970, when he was bused from a black high school to an all-white school in Inglewood. The very first day, he recalled, demonstrators greeted their arrival, and one man waved a sign bearing racial epithets.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You can't have a good barbershop conversation without a dissenting view, and in this case Drew Palmer took the challenge.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sterling's purported remarks were deplorable, said Palmer, an engineer and youth mentor. But he says he's more incensed by the casual use of the N-word in street talk and rap lyrics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why a firestorm over Sterling, he asked, and silence on the objectification of women and glorification of gangs in popular culture? Is it just about capitalism, same as it is for Sterling? And why compassion for millionaire ballplayers who aren't necessarily the best role models, but so little consideration of the working poor who couldn't afford to see a Clipper game even if Sterling allowed them into the building?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Palmer won some points, but no one in the room was about to give Donald Sterling a pass. Simmons, like Tolliver, saw a parallel with the winner of this year's best-picture Oscar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""It's like '12 Years a Slave,'"" he said. ""Just call it '12 Years a Clipper.'""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>steve.lopez@latimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: SOUTH L.A.

University of Texas, a case involving racial preferences in college admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims that she was denied admission to the university on account of her race. The school says that it's allowed to take race into account to achieve a diverse student body.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chief Justice Roberts was among the more aggressive questioners during oral arguments Wednesday, asking a lawyer for the school what constituted an acceptable ""critical mass"" of black and Hispanic students on campus and whether someone who was one-quarter or one-eighth Hispanic could claim that ethnicity on an application. He also suggested that the university is essentially setting percentage goals for minority students without acknowledging the practice. If Chief Justice Roberts is going to start voting with the court's liberals, he has an odd of showing it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>""Of course, the term ahead will provide many more opportunities for the chief justice to signal his sympathies,"" wrote Tejinder Singh of SCOTUSblog on Thursday. ""But yesterday's argument undermines the theory that Chief Justice Roberts switched teams for good. In all likelihood, he is a safe vote for Ms. Fisher.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Todd Gaziano, a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, agreed.

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408523809.xml.txt	"<div><p>Goodbye Pork Rinds, Hello Penthouse</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the day last month when Vice President Gore formally announced his presidential campaign, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson gave reporters a tour of what he called the real Gore homestead: the penthouse suite of a luxury Washington hotel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nicholson's stunt was clever. It was also outdated--better suited to an era of politics that is receding rapidly into the past. In 2000, Gore should not have to worry much about disguising his establishment credentials and upbringing; neither should Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who probably enjoys pork rinds no more than his father did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both these front-runners are superbly well-positioned to benefit from one of the realities of Clinton-era politics: the triumph of the elites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The messiness of Bill Clinton's personal life, and the anger he elicits from opponents, have helped obscure one of his principal legacies: He closed a three-decade chapter during which populism-- fueled by the grievances of average citizens toward establishment institutions and establishment values--was a dominant force in American politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the late 1960s, nearly all important political movements have drawn their power from this source. Liberals succeeded in mobilizing voters in a wave of populist grievance against the establishment's prosecution of the Vietnam War. But most populist causes were distinctly conservative in origin: anger at courts for promoting racial preferences and inventing a right to abortion; anger at politicians for high taxes and lenient crime and welfare policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early machinations of 2000 politics highlight vividly how these movements have been drained of energy during the Clinton years. Polls show the tax-cutting issue spinning with none of its old traction, to the frustration of many GOP lawmakers. Tolerance, meanwhile, has replaced grievance as the new ethos of national politics--as shown by the efforts of presidential candidates like Bush and Elizabeth Dole to mute traditional Republican opposition to abortion rights and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And look what happened to the most recent populist sensation to roil national politics: term limits. Many of the throw-the-bums-out candidates elected to Congress on three-term pledges in 1994 are now busy concocting rationales for sticking around after all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Populism has been dethroned by a directly opposite phenomenon: a rough national consensus that the people who are running America, in the national government and in other public institutions, may actually be doing an acceptable job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Who are the elites of the Clinton era? In the most literal sense, they are the collection of investment bankers, moderately progressive policy experts and political consultants who run this administration day to day. More broadly, they are the community of liberal special- interest advocates, lawyers and foreign policy interventionists whose political values--based on the premise that an educated cadre of experts generally knows what's best for the country--have gained primacy in national life in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is irony here. Clinton first ran for president with a campaign that saw itself as a populist cause. His advisers dressed in denim. His mission was to evict a president allegedly oblivious to the concerns of ordinary voters. Yet after six and a half years in office, the Man from Hope (who was also the Man from Yale Law School) has made American politics safe for Volvo drivers and pointy heads of all stripes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No sensible politician, of course, would choose to present himself or herself to voters next year as the candidate of the elite. But plenty of these politicians are supporting--or at least trying to reconcile their views with--the elite premises that are shaping this year's politics. That's because many of these premises now have clear majority support. Just look at two issues that have dominated Washington's agenda since the end of Clinton's impeachment trial in February: gun control and Kosovo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gun control and foreign interventionism are both elite enthusiasms of long-standing. And both ideas run against the grain of even older populist traditions. Indeed, both are capable of exciting intense antagonism among people who think elites have no business interfering with gun ownership or risking American lives and treasure abroad except when national interests are directly threatened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet congressional Democrats, many of whom were punished by voters for gun-control votes in 1994, are pushing the issue anew--secure in the knowledge that it now enjoys overwhelming majority support, even in many conservative districts. Clinton's Kosovo intervention, likewise, enjoyed majority support--even though it was a humanitarian mission in a place most Americans had never heard of before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Budget policy, the other issue that will dominate Washington's attention this year, illustrates how Clinton himself is tugged by competing populist and elitist impulses. In 1993, he famously complained to his staff that they had become virtual ""Eisenhower Republicans,"" as he had to give up the domestic spending he wanted in order to convince Wall Street he was doing enough to lower the deficit. Six years later, he regards the elimination of that deficit as a paramount achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several reasons for populism's rout. The most important may be the most obvious: the surging U.S. economy. So much money is being made that nearly everyone is reaping the benefits. The preoccupation of 2000 politics will be keeping the golden goose on her nest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A vivid sign that the Age of Elites is upon us came earlier this year when Time magazine ran an idolizing cover story on the ""Committee to Save the World."" The supposed saviors were Alan Greenspan, the unelected Federal Reserve chairman; then-Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street tycoon; and his successor, Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a soaring Dow is only one manifestation of a larger trend. Crime is down. So are most indexes of poverty. The federal government has tamed its chronic budget deficits. The U.S. military has performed with impressive competence in wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means is Bill Clinton responsible for all or even most of this good news, but it is no surprise that he should be the beneficiary of it. Decades of ostentatious failures--from Vietnam to Watergate to a series of recessions--were quite naturally going to produce populist backlash. Success, on the other hand, empowers elites: The Gallup organization reports 55 percent of the country is ""satisfied"" with the direction of the country, compared with just 14 percent seven years ago this month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The defeat of populism also reflects a deliberate political strategy of the Clinton White House. With actions ranging from his signing of a GOP-drafted welfare reform bill in 1996 to his consistent focus on anti-crime measures, Clinton has co-opted issues that Republicans for decades used effectively to tap populist resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That strategy has been aided by a powerful tool that Clinton uses more aggressively than virtually any other politician: polling. No previous White House has integrated polling so thoroughly into the policy-making process as this one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At first blush, obsessive polling of the public seems like the most populist politics of all. The paradox, however, is that polling can actually help defeat populist fervors by letting elites know precisely how to accommodate them in the most surgical way possible. Clinton's careful positioning on <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>--""mend it, don't end it""--is one example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax cuts are another. No doubt Clinton the Wonk would prefer that the government keep all the money it can. Clinton the Politician, however, knows acutely the dangers of ignoring the popularity of tax cuts. In 1996, he and then-consultant Dick Morris used polling to create a strategy of targeted tax deductions and credits, used to subsidize education and other favored goals. Genuine tax-cut proponents correctly identify the elitist premise of this approach: Why should the government be directing the ways you can spend your own money? To their frustration, however, these critics have seen Clinton's maneuvering deplete the tax issue of its potency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, even Clinton's sex scandal ended up as a ratification of elite values. For decades, going back to FDR's time, it had been a populist theme that the people running Washington were secretly libertines and hypocrites. Then last year came proof that at least some of those suspicions were true. The public responded, not with populist moralism, but with cosmopolitan tolerance about weaknesses of the flesh.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls suggest that many people, exhausted by seven years of the Clinton psychodrama, are ready to see him go. But the anti-populist brand of politics he represents stays behind. If Gore and Bush retain their front-runner status, next year's presidential race will feature two charmed children of the establishment, however much they drape themselves in down-home airs. (That statement would be equally true of Bill Bradley and Elizabeth Dole.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore, who graduated from Harvard in 1969 and is the son of a senator, hopes to be nominated in an unusually orderly process as the chosen candidate of his party's elite. Bush, who graduated from Yale in 1968 and is the son of a president, hopes to be nominated in an unusually orderly process as the chosen candidate of his party's elite. Gore preaches centrism and tolerance. Bush preaches centrism and compassion. If Gore gets elected, he will no doubt surround himself with moderately liberal veterans of Washington's policy establishment who will try above all not to let prosperity wane. If Bush gets elected, he will surround himself with moderately conservative veterans of Washington's policy establishment who will try above all not to let prosperity wane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Either way, the era of pork-rind politics is over.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Harris covers the White House for The Washington Post.</p></div>"			3					6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2633115690.xml.txt	"<div><p>Ahmaud Arbery’s racist killers are grotesque, but their ‘hate crimes’ prosecution was a show trial</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If fractious Americans can agree on anything nowadays, it should be that the punishment of thought crimes is the odious essence of totalitarianism. So, consider the constitutionally dubious conviction of Ahmaud Arbery's three murderers for having committed ""hate crimes.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The criminal justice system has now correctly concluded that his murderers were racists whose racism manifested itself in their actions. This conclusion, however, does not justify complacency about deciding that because the killers' gross acts reflected grotesque thinking, the thinking merits its own punishment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The killers chased Arbery — a Black jogger in a White neighborhood — and killed him with a shotgun. For this violation of Georgia's law against murder, a state court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Then this week, they were convicted in a federal court of violating a federal law that punishes those who violate a person's civil rights ""because of"" their ""race, color,"" etc. For this they can again be sentenced to life in prison.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as Jacob Sullum, senior editor of Reason, notes: It is therefore ""equally true that the defendants were convicted 'because of' their benighted beliefs. Condemning them as bigots was the whole point of this exercise, since they had already been condemned (and punished) as murderers.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This misuse of judicial proceedings was, Sullum says, possible because of two regrettable Supreme Court conclusions: The killers' ""second, symbolic prosecution did not amount to double jeopardy, because the state and federal crimes, defined by two different 'sovereigns,' are not 'the same offense.'"" And prosecutions of hate crimes are deemed consistent with the First Amendment, even if they impose added punishment for speech that, however scabrous, is nevertheless constitutionally protected.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, the government can conduct trials for the purpose of virtue signaling — to announce, however redundantly, that it condemns particular frames of mind. A bigot's shabby mental furniture is, however, not a crime. Were it, what other mentalities might government decide to stigmatize by imposing special punishments? Arbery's killers had expressed their racism in speech (texts, social media posts, remarks) that no jurisdiction can proscribe. But their federal punishment will be imposed precisely because their speech demonstrated their bigotry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Proving the intent behind a criminal act is crucial. And no principle should prohibit ever making punishment proportional to the motive for a criminal act. However, deciding that an actor's heinous behavior is made more heinous because they had a bad attitude is dangerous. It is one thing for the law to hold individuals responsible for controlling their minds, which presumably control their bodies. It is quite another thing for government to inventory an individual's mind for the purpose of declaring how admirable the government's mind is, and perhaps by doing so to improve the public's mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This impulse melds with what C.S. Lewis called the remedial theory of punishment, whereby government detains offenders until they are cured, as determined by government's ""official straighteners."" Another totalitarian temptation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only an engaged judiciary vigorously applying constitutional protections prevents the woke from greasing this nation's slide into something like Europe's increasingly minute supervision of speech — and of the mentalities speech reflects. The European Court of Human Rights says governments may ""sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred."" By ""even prevent,"" the ECHR evidently extends permission for preemptive censorship and punishment. Based on what?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In today's America, ""hate speech"" has become an elastic concept stretched to encompass any expression of ideas — e.g., opposition to race-based <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> or saying marriage should be between a man and a woman — that offends any of the plethora of easily offended factions. So, various colleges and universities have proscribed speech that might ""annoy or otherwise inconvenience"" anyone, and certain ""attitudes,"" and ""verbal harm"" from injurious ""assumptions"" or ""implications."" They have guaranteed ""freedom from indignity of any type"" and protection from ""patronizing remarks.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional grandstanding includes the promiscuous multiplication of federal crimes, many of them duplicative of state crimes. From Congress's bottomless moral pork barrel comes proposals for niche hate crime legislation: The latest, the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, was signed into law May 20 last year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government is failing conspicuously at many basic things — budgeting, preserving the currency's value, maintaining infrastructure, educating children, etc. Surely government should economize its exertions by not conducting show trials for the purpose of highlighting — perhaps for the public's moral improvement — that it is offended by certain thinking that can precede certain behaviors that are already criminalized and forcefully punished.</p></div>"	2								2

None, however, is assured of success.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who happens to be black and also a longtime friend of Gov. Pete Wilson, raised the issue of admissions quotas again last month, attracting considerable media attention. Mr. Connerly, who last year objected because some minority-group members apparently were ""admitted almost solely on the basis of race"" to the prestigious university's medical schools, this time widened his focus to the undergraduate enrollment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the June regents meeting, he asked administrators to consider alternatives to race-based admissions and to review federal laws and regulations that may constrain the UC. Mr. Connerly's direction, however, is clear: He doesn't like masked forms of ""government redistribution that takes from one and gives to another."" He wants, instead, to ""market"" the university to groups that are underrepresented in the student body and assist them in preparing for application. As far as race and sex are concerned, that'd be it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Connerly makes his living as a consultant to public agencies and other entities, especially those concerned with land use, which is what brought him and Mr. Wilson together when they both worked in the statehouse two decades ago. He says he has never used minority set-asides to get contracts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Mr. Connerly's been a rather lonely voice on the regents. ""We need to put a little fiber in people who don't want to be perceived as racists or Uncle Toms,"" he says of his fellow board members, nearly all of them appointed by Republican governors. ""We're now at the point where the returns we're getting from this (preference policy) are little, but they come at a very high price.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That cost is the increasing bitterness of white and Asian-heritage students who find that merit isn't enough in what was long an objective process. On the other side, however, adamant defenders of quotas will spare nothing to defend their beachhead at the UC. In recent years, the legislature has passed mandates that the state universities admit in proportion with California's ethnic distribution. (They were vetoed.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legislative politics on this issue may be changing, as bills to bar preferences in public-sector admissions, hiring and contracting now should get a fuller hearing. The main reason for this is the California Civil Rights Initiative, a constitutional amendment flatly outlawing quotas that looms for the 1996 ballot. The legislature, still controlled by Democrats, may wish to pass statutes that steal some of the initiative's thunder while mucking up its succinct clarity with lots of lawyer-like language. Still, the citizen measure's sponsors are willing to go as far in the Capitol as they can.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all likelihood, they will have to proceed to collect 615,000 valid signatures for a ballot placement next year. While many are predicting a polarizing and victorious campaign that will change the agenda of both state and national races, the fact is that backers face a daunting task. They will need about $1 million to qualify, and then will be up against an opposition including businesses that rely on quotas for their income.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By contrast, supporters are cash poor. Major corporations will sit this one out, fearing a public-relations hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The story of the failed California voucher campaign of 1993 is a reminder of how an underfunded proposal is susceptible to an expensive campaign of harassment and distortion. On the other hand, Proposition 187 this past fall, despite its faults, proved that an inherently popular, grass-roots drive (with gubernatorial support) can win against loud opposition. The Civil Rights Initiative has going for it, at least so far, the quiet support of many moderate Democrats who grasp what the racial wedge is now doing to their party and their society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In sum, the California ferment stems from a bid to reclaim <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>'s original standing: It is a way to boost those who need help competing on what is, at the point of competition, a level field. It's an attempt to pull the idea back from its current emphasis on institutional mandates and return the focus to where it belongs -- on individual achievement.</p></div>"	2							6

The House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held a hearing about H.R. 40, a proposal from Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, that would authorize a national apology and study reparations for slavery against black people in America, or as Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to it in his testimony, a method that entailed “torture, rape, and child trafficking” for 250 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hearing date was significant. June 19 is “Juneteenth,” a celebration of the day in 1865 when Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, with the news that the Civil War was over, and that all remaining slaves in Texas were free.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the media the night before the hearings that he opposed reparations because, as he says: “We’ve tried to deal with the original sin of slavery by passing civil rights legislation and electing an African American president, Barack Obama.

We, as black Americans, are here telling our story, yet too many people choose not to want to hear it. Out of sight, out of mind? The black story doesn’t cease to exist because others choose to ignore it. And the timeline of the black experience on these shores did not stop when Barack Obama became president. Our stories should not be shelved because a white senator such as McConnell doesn’t see the benefit of righting a wrong that is so massive.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just because no one has lived 150 years to give a firsthand account of the atrocities against so many black generations doesn’t make the idea of economic reparations for their descendants insurmountable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea that reparations are a bad idea because no one alive now is responsible makes no sense. Coates was on point with his rebuttal. It’s time for America to get uncomfortable and put money behind fixing the inherent damage caused by slavery — damage that lingers today.

The relation between freedom and literacy became the compelling theme of the slave narratives, the great body of printed books that ex-slaves generated to assert their common humanity with white Americans and to indict the system that had oppressed them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the years since the abolition of slavery, the possession of literacy has been a cardinal value of the African-American tradition. It is no accident that the first great victory in the legal battle over segregation was fought on the grounds of education -- of equal access to literacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, blacks are failing to gain access to the new tools of literacy: the digital ''knowledge economy.'' And while the dilemma that our ancestors confronted was imposed by others, this cybersegregation is, to a large degree, self-imposed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Government's latest attempt to understand why low-income African-Americans and Hispanics are slower to embrace the Internet and the personal computer than whites -- the Commerce Department study ''Falling Through the Net'' -- suggests that income alone can't be blamed for the so-called digital divide. For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms. Net promoters are concerned that the digital divide threatens to become a 21st century poll tax that, in effect, disenfranchises a third of the nation. Our children, especially, need access not only to the vast resources that technology offers for education, but also to the rich cultural contexts that define their place in the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today we stand at the brink of becoming two societies, one largely white and plugged in and the other black and unplugged.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the most tragic aspects of slavery was the way it destroyed social connections. In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls ''social death,'' slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illustration (Stephen Doyle)</p></div>"			3					6

Board of Education, Call Him Thurgood Thomas</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP board is scheduled to decide today whether to join the interest groups that oppose a black Supreme Court nominee. Benjamin Hooks has said his group would have preferred another Thurgood Marshall. The NAACP should know that when it comes to the Supreme Court's most important civil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another Thurgood Marshall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all the smoke cooked up by Judge Thomas's critics, no one seems to have noticed that he takes precisely the same broad view of the constitutional promise of equality that Mr. Marshall as the lawyer arguing Brown v. Board of Education tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court to adopt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rights movement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshall worked. The justices finally declared that separate but equal facilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senate perpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate that the court struck down these racist laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Brown is a classic example of a correct result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely on dubious sociological data on how much better black students supposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms as whites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies in publications such as the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research. It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that ""all men are created equal,"" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing ""Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court missed the forest for the trees. ""The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,"" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the ""first principles of equality and liberty"" would ""lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. ""The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,"" the brief said. ""Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, ""Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,"" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is ""not without some good points,"" he said, adding that ""if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p></div>"	2								2

You wanted guys not with the biggest muscles, but the most heart. Not the mopers who would walk off the field when they felt the first raindrops or got bumped in the nose.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You looked for the kids who really wanted to play--and to win.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so it is as well in the bruising contact sport of politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You want candidates with fire in the belly, defined by William Safire in his ""New Political Dictionary"" as ""an unquenchable thirst for power or glory; the burning drive to win a race or achieve a goal.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They make the best candidates because they run with enthusiasm. And if elected, they're less likely to goof off or to whine, like so many politicians and athletes, about adversity and their sacrifice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I thought about this last week when the entry deadline for the gubernatorial race passed and three potential candidates--two stars and a prospect--remained on the sidelines. They didn't have the fire in the belly to compete. And that caused a lot of bellyaching within the political establishment--mostly among Democrats--about being stuck with the reserves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We deserve better. What a choice!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, time out. Quit the moaning. Like it or not, one of these four people will be California's next governor: Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, 51; or a Democrat--Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, 55; zillionaire airline exec Al Checchi, 49; or Rep. Jane Harman, 52, of Torrance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They've all got the fire--the energy and the courage--to fight for the most important elective office to be filled in America this year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as Checchi campaign manager Darry Sragow points out: ""The absolute truth is the republic will survive with any of these four at the helm.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's play could've-should've for a moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 64, could have been a great governor. But she's very comfortable in her current job and dreaded getting roughed up in a gubernatorial race. She was flinching. So Feinstein is better off staying in the Senate, where she excels, and the state probably is better off too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leon Panetta, 59--former Monterey congressman and White House chief of staff--had promise. He could have been an excellent governor. But he wasted all last year deferring to fellow Democrat Feinstein. She didn't bow out until Jan. 20, too late for him to get organized. If Panetta actually had the fire, however, he would have spent last year traveling the state, showing concern for its problems, raising money and positioning himself to run.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, 67, teased the news media and basked in the begging before concluding that he was just too comfortable--to run or to serve. ""Be careful, you might get what you're going after,"" Riordan said he told himself. ""I love California, but Los Angeles is still my No. 1 love.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fine. Then he made the right decision to stay there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But please spare us the spin about how the mayor was a virtual cinch winner. First, he had to beat Lungren for the GOP nomination. Lungren is a good Republican; Riordan is a good Republican mostly in the eyes of Democrats. He endorsed Feinstein in 1994 and didn't support either the anti-illegal immigration or anti-<span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> initiatives. He was a fat target for Lungren. Plus, he's not very good on the stump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new open primary certainly would have helped. But we'll never know whether enough Democrats would have crossed over to nominate Riordan for the Republicans. That's awfully iffy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we're left with is a wide-open race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls show Davis leading in the Democratic contest. But Checchi--having already spent more than $4 million of his fortune on TV ads--is moving up fast. In mock general elections, both Davis and Checchi run about even with Lungren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Harman is the only woman in the race and that's presumed to be a plus. But she's a late entry and unknown outside L.A. She urgently needs to develop a compelling message and to spend millions of her own dollars getting it out on TV.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a myth that Harman also is the only moderate running. Davis still gets tagged as a liberal because two decades ago he was Gov. Jerry Brown's top aide, but basically he's a moderate. And Checchi? He wants to execute serial rapists. That's hardly liberal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've got a race between three experienced pols and an outsider--Checchi--who frequently hasn't even voted. However, he did spend all last year stumping the state boning up on issues.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe these aren't the best governors conceivable. But they're the most eager. They've got the fire and really want the job. The others refused to run. It's time to stop grousing and start choosing</p></div>"	2							6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/432267882.xml.txt	"<div><p>Bonfire Of the Vanities</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's only one thing left for Trent Lott to do now. He will have to become a Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his doomed but endlessly inventive effort to grovel his way back to political favor by taking positions way to the left of his own party, the senator came out for ''across the board'' <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and pledged to proclaim the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation some kind of quasi-Kwanzaa holiday. If the Lott panderthon had lasted into the weekend, he might yet have endorsed Al Sharpton's theory of the Tawana Brawley case or popped up on Comedy Central to host a holiday festival of ''Sanford and Son'' reruns. Tom Wolfe couldn't make this stuff up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But of course he already did. The hypocrisy and cynicism we saw in the Lott affair from nearly all parties -- political and otherwise -- was ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' all over again. The supposed cause of our new racial uproar, the senator's remarks at Strom Thurmond's centennial birthday party, rapidly became irrelevant to the big picture (as did the clueless majority leader himself). Is Mr. Lott a racist? According to Jim Jeffords, former Senator Paul Simon and nearly everyone else who knows him, he's not. But after awhile that no longer mattered. Mr. Lott had become, in the words of a widely quoted (but unidentified) White House hand, a ''walking pinata.'' And a most convenient one. Republicans, Democrats and the press alike could all prove our moral superiority, cost-free, by stringing up a certifiable fool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we shouldn't congratulate ourselves quite so fast. The Lott story didn't break this month -- it broke four years ago. Where was the press then? Where were the Democrats? From December 1998 until the following spring, a black columnist at New York's Daily News, the politically nonpartisan Stanley Crouch, repeatedly laid out goods on Mr. Lott more damaging than the senator's latest transgression: his long and intimate association with the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization whose initials are not a phonic echo of K.K.K. for nothing. A few newspaper reporters and columnists recounted the same history, but Mr. Crouch, instead of winning a Pulitzer, was largely ignored by big guns in the media as well as by political leaders of both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's new offense almost fell through the journalistic cracks as well. Though his embrace of Mr. Thurmond's past took place in a room full of Washington reporters and politicos and was broadcast on C-Span, it was not at first reported in any paper (or on any evening TV news broadcast), even those that did cover the Thurmond party. Why? It may be because the spectacle of a leading Republican backslapping with unreconstructed Dixiecrats did not initially strike anyone as big news.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Jeb Bush succinctly condemned Mr. Lott for the crime of being ''damaging to the Republican Party'' -- as opposed to, say, being damaging to black people -- he was telling the truth. Mr. Lott would not have hurt his party were he an anomaly within it. What made him toxic to the Republican fraternity was his careless revelation of its darkest predilections.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the Lott transgressions that resurfaced during his trial-by-media was an occasion in the 1990's, cited by Robert George in The New York Post, when he summoned black staffers abruptly into his personal office ''to provide 'color' for photos in a media profile.'' Such a media strategy is no different from that of the 2000 Republican convention, where the party filled the stage with a ''Soul Train'' jamboree of break dancers and gospel singers to provide ''color'' for its own image. The goal of that minstrel show -- as well as of the strategic planting of black faces in likely TV shots on the floor -- was to belie the fact that black delegates at that convention made up 4 percent, a historic low for the party (even lower than at the Pat Buchanan-Pat Robertson convention in Houston in 1996).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lott's public display of nostalgia for the South's racist past is hardly unique either. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, gave an interview to a neo-Confederate magazine, Southern Partisan, in 1999 in which he vowed ''to do more'' to defend the legacy of Jefferson Davis, a Lott hero as well, from anyone who would smear him for having ''some perverted agenda.'' (Slavery, perhaps?) Some of Mr. Ashcroft's actions in public life have matched his words. When he was Missouri attorney general in the 1980's, a federal judge threatened to hold him and his state in contempt for their ''continual delay and failure to comply'' with a landmark voluntary desegregation plan in St. Louis, according to a Washington Post report in January 2001. When running for governor, Mr. Ashcroft even boasted of having done ''everything in my power legally'' to fight that plan. This was 35 years after Mr. Thurmond's Dixiecrat candidacy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its effort to portray Mr. Lott as a one-of-a-kind bad apple, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page said on Thursday: ''Republicans may once have used race to polarize the electorate, especially in the South. But that strategy long ago stopped being useful.'' Tell that to George W. Bush, who beat John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary after what Newsweek called ''a smear campaign'' of leaflets, e-mails and telephone calls calling attention to the McCains' ''black child'' (an adopted daughter from Bangladesh). Or to Sonny Perdue, the new Republican governor of Georgia, elected in part by demagoguing the sanctity of the Confederate flag.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long ago stopped being useful? Tell that to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Bush, who appeared at Bob Jones University in 1999 and 2000. ''Of all universities in America,'' asked the commentator Fareed Zakaria on ABC last weekend, ''why is it that Republicans have felt the need to make a pilgrimage to the one university that bans interracial dating?'' Now that Mr. Lott is no longer the issue, will any of the conservatives who called for his decapitation answer that question?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point here is not that these Republican leaders are racists, or that all (or most) Republicans are racist, or that all racists are Republicans. ''These are not normal Republican ideas,'' wrote the conservative author David Brooks, in a characteristically thoughtful piece about Mr. Lott in this week's Newsweek. And he's right. But there are still too many Republican politicians who believe they can pander to whatever racist voters are out there without being called on it. When they are, they cringe -- not so much because they care about losing their few black votes but because they care about losing soccer moms who are offended by race-baiting. ''Elections are settled in the suburbs nowadays, 43 percent of the vote,'' said George Will in condemning Mr. Lott. It's that political reality, not any moral imperative, that mandated the majority leader's death sentence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush is no bigot, and as he likes to remind us, some of his best employees are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. He is in favor of something called ''affirmative access'' -- which has led to a grand total of zero black Republican Congressmen in the next Congress. ''Compassionate conservatism'' seems less a program than a p.r. strategy to provide cover for the likes of a Lott or an Ashcroft.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked this week what the administration has done for black Americans, Ari Fleischer used the kind of examples we heard from Mr. Lott. He said that ''the president looks forward to going to Africa'' (how patronizing can you be?) and wants ''to double funding for historically black colleges and universities'' (weren't the Republicans for color-blind policies rather than a politically correct form of de facto segregation?). Mr. Fleischer also said that the president sees education as ''the next civil rights movement.'' If so, Mr. Bush is not that movement's courageous leader; in his education bill, he dumped the tiny school voucher provision that Republican polls say many black families want.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black voters are not fooled by such empty theatrics. For all the ''diversity'' at his convention and his rhetorical ''compassion,'' Mr. Bush drew a third less of the black vote than his father and Bob Dole did. The White House's main concern now is that white voters be fooled. So Republicans are trying to create a moral equivalence between Democratic racial lapses and their own, hoping that Robert Byrd's long-renounced K.K.K. past and use of the word ''nigger'' will somehow blur their own recent record. Bill Frist is the ideal new Senate majority leader, because his own genuinely good works in Africa and ''compassionate conservative'' geniality will camouflage a voting pattern that, on any issue touching black Americans, is virtually the same as Mr. Lott's.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I almost feel sorry for Trent Lott. Despite all the hyperbole that preceded his demise, he is no Bull Connor or David Duke or even Jesse Helms. He's just the guy who had to die before anyone looked too closely at other, even more powerful politicians' sins.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing</p></div>"			3					6

Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who assumed the leadership of the campus nearly two years ago, is getting ready to determine who will be on the Diversity Council and what it will do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The effort is worthwhile, and its timing could not be better. Last month a regent of the University of California, Ward Connerly, spoke out against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in the community and said he would try to propose a method of ending race-based preferences in hiring and admissions. Although diversity and <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> are not the same thing, they do tend to get tangled up in the oft-heated conversations on those topics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A consultant told UCI officials that the campus seems committed to diversity at the top and at the grass roots, but needs more support for the concept in the middle. That will be the job of the Diversity Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UCI has performed well off-campus in promoting diversity. One example was welcoming Fullerton high school students who wanted to learn more about people from different ethnic backgrounds. Those students then helped launch cultural diversity programs at their school. UCI graduates have been active in fostering diversity as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Huntington Beach, UCI graduate Alma L. Lopez has helped create a large mural at the art center that shows the various cultures in the county.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On campus too UCI has tried to blend students from varying backgrounds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its percentage of Asian students, 44%, is the largest in the University of California system. They benefit from events such as this month's 11th annual Asian Pacific Awareness Conference, which has the praiseworthy goal of explaining differences among the many cultures of Asia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, one area where the campus needs improvement is increasing the numbers of women and minorities it hires and promotes as faculty members.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since arriving on campus, Wilkening has consistently said she believes UCI's diversity is an asset and a selling point. Those beliefs resonate in the community as well. Last year the Orange County Annual Survey found that nearly four out of five residents said the county needed programs to increase dialogue among ethnic groups. That was a realistic assessment of the need for all residents to get along in an increasingly diverse Orange County.</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/399053714.xml.txt	"<div><p>Conservatism and the University Curriculum</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The political science departments at elite private universities such as Harvard and Yale, at leading small liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore and Williams, and at distinguished large public universities like the University of Maryland and the University of California, Berkeley, offer undergraduates a variety of courses on a range of topics. But one topic the undergraduates at these institutions -- and at the vast majority of other universities and colleges -- are unlikely to find covered is conservatism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no legitimate intellectual justification for this omission. The exclusion of conservative ideas from the curriculum contravenes the requirements of a liberal education and an objective study of political science.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political science departments are generally divided into the subfields of American politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. Conservative ideas are relevant in all four, but the obvious areas within the political science discipline to teach about the great tradition of conservative ideas and thinkers are American politics and political theory. That rarely happens today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, a political science department may feature a course on American political thought that includes a few papers from ""The Federalist"" and some chapters from Alexis de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most students will hear next to nothing about the conservative tradition in American politics that stretches from John Adams to Theodore Roosevelt to William F. Buckley Jr. to Milton Friedman to Ronald Reagan. This tradition emphasizes moral and intellectual excellence, worries that democratic practices and egalitarian norms will threaten individual liberty, attends to the claims of religion and the role it can play in educating citizens for liberty, and provides both a vigorous defense of free-market capitalism and a powerful critique of capitalism's relentless overturning of established ways. It also recognized early that communism represented an implacable enemy of freedom. And for 30 years it has been animated by a fascinating quarrel between traditionalists, libertarians and neoconservatives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While ignoring conservatism, the political theory subfield regularly offers specialized courses in liberal theory and democratic theory; African-American political thought and feminist political theory; the social theory of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and the neo-Marxist Frankfurt school; and numerous versions of postmodern political theory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Students may encounter in various political theory courses an essay by the British historian and philosopher Michael Oakeshott, or a chapter from a book by the German-born American political philosopher Leo Strauss. But they will learn very little about the constellation of ideas and thinkers linked in many cases by a common concern with the dangers to liberty that stem from the excesses to which liberty and equality give rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That constellation begins to come into focus at the end of the 18th century with Edmund Burke's ""Reflections on the Revolution in France."" It draws on the conservative side of the liberal tradition, particularly Adam Smith and David Hume and includes Tocqueville's great writings on democracy and aristocracy and John Stuart Mill's classical liberalism. It gets new life in the years following World War II from Friedrich Hayek's seminal writings on liberty and limited government and Russell Kirk's reconstruction of traditionalist conservatism. And it is elevated by Michael Oakeshott's eloquent reflections on the pervasive tendency in modern politics to substitute abstract reason for experience and historical knowledge, and by Leo Strauss's deft explorations of the dependence of liberty on moral and intellectual virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without an introduction to the conservative tradition in America and the conservative dimensions of modern political philosophy, political science students are condemned to a substantially incomplete and seriously unbalanced knowledge of their subject. Courses on this tradition should be mandatory for students of politics; today they are not even an option at most American universities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When progressives, who dominate the academy, confront arguments about the need for the curriculum to give greater attention to conservative ideas, they often hear them as a demand for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>. Usually they mishear. Certainly <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> for conservatives is a terrible idea.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political science departments should not seek out professors with conservative political opinions. Nor should they lower scholarly standards. That approach would embrace the very assumption that has corrupted liberal education: that to study and teach particular political ideas one's identity is more important than the breadth and depth of one's knowledge and the rigor of one's thinking</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One need not be a Puritan to study and teach colonial American religious thought, an ancient Israelite to study and teach biblical thought, or a conservative or Republican to study and teach conservative ideas. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> in university hiring for political conservatives should be firmly rejected, certainly by conservatives and defenders of liberal education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, if political science departments were compelled to hire competent scholars to offer courses on conservative ideas and conservative thinkers, the result would be more faculty positions filled by political conservatives, since they and not progressives tend to take an interest in studying conservative thought. But there is no reason why scholars with progressive political opinions and who belong to the Democratic Party can not, out of a desire to understand American political history and modern political philosophy, study and teach conservatism in accordance with high intellectual standards. It would be good if they did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would also be good if every political science department offered a complementary course on the history of progressivism in America. This would discourage professors from conflating American political thought as a whole with progressivism, which they do in a variety of ways, starting with the questions they tend to ask and those they refuse to entertain.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Incorporating courses on conservatism in the curriculum may, as students graduate, disperse, and pursue their lives, yield the political benefit of an increase in mutual understanding between left and right. In this way, reforming the curriculum could diminish the polarization that afflicts our political and intellectual classes. But that benefit is admittedly distant and speculative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the near term, giving conservative ideas their due will have the concrete and immediate benefit of advancing liberal education's proper and commendable goal, which is the formation of free and well-furnished minds.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Berkowitz is a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Peter Berkowitz</p></div>"	2								2

Though opposition to this gesture has made strange bedfellows out of Jesse Jackson (who called it ''meaningless'') and Newt Gingrich (''a dead end''), Bill Clinton is already hedging about it, a few Congressmen are calling for reparations, and the debate could easily eat up the full year of the President's promised race initiative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why not just cut to the chase, and have Strom Thurmond deliver the apology right now?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bipartisan, all-white Congressmen sponsoring the apology mean well. But as Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian who wrote the definitive text on Reconstruction, says: ''At the end of the Civil War, the slaves didn't want an apology. They wanted substantive change in the way things were -- 'Give us some land, and you can keep the apology.' '' If Congress wants to apologize, it might start with its own transgressions, from Willie Horton-inspired campaign ads to its persistent inability to address the inner-city meltdown that is the most intractable legacy of slavery and its bastard offspring, segregation, today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this would require substance, not symbolism, and when it comes to substance about race and poverty, both parties would rather play to the gallery. The G.O.P. focus on ending <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> is a hit in the polls, so never mind that the party with a Congressional majority has offered teachers-union bashing in lieu of action to deal with the root of all ills, failing schools in grades K-12. Nor have the Republicans found a plausible substitute for <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> that might win over the only three major figures in the party with credibility on race -- Colin Powell, Jack Kemp and the lone black Congressman, J. C. Watts -- all of whom favor a just reform of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative-action</span>, not its abolition without a net for the poor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken hits for what cynics regard as a public-relations racial policy: a call for a national conversation, the appointment of yet another blue-ribbon commission and town meetings that may fade as quickly as the volunteerism summit in Philadelphia. In fairness, he should be given the year he's asked for, and the benefit of the doubt. But you don't have to be cynical to have lots of doubts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candid conversation about race -- as opposed to the P.C. homilies of Mr. Clinton's San Diego speech -- is easier decreed than had in a country that has already repressed memory of the stark racial gap revealed by the polar black and white reactions to both O. J. verdicts. As for actions, Mr. Clinton took seven months to fill the top job for civil-rights enforcement in his own Justice Department. At the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is now a backlog of 75,000 discrimination cases. And Mr. Clinton has little beyond rhetoric to offer the nation's cities, either.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one doubts the President's empathy with African-Americans. But empathy won't get anyone a job, housing or education. ''The problem with Clinton,'' says Roger Wilkins, the author and Johnson Administration civil-rights official, ''is he's like somebody who says I owe you some money, and I really want to pay you, but I had to stop by the gambling casino on the way to your house.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since big-government schemes for addressing social welfare are politically taboo, Mr. Wilkins says that if he were President, he would have convened the country's best mayors to identify their ''biggest problems and biggest successes'' in dealing with the crises of race and poverty in their own cities. These mayors -- of all races and both parties -- are on the front lines; every day the most creative and committed of them are trying out ''real ideas'' on ''real people''; their proposals for replicating their successes nationally and for targeted Federal funding to help do so would have the credibility that Washington programs do not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the President we do have -- and his political adversaries -- seem inclined to deal with the abstract rather than the concrete. If a year from now there is nothing to show for their efforts but a repeal of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and a loftily written Presidential report, they will truly have something to apologize for.</p></div>"	2			4					
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/1750369183.xml.txt	"<div><p>How Trump does it (Posted 2015-12-21 02:11:42)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to what I've called ""the politics of self-esteem."" By this, I mean that increasing numbers of people, on both the right and left, and most with good intentions, have become politically engaged because it makes them feel better. It raises their self-esteem. This phenomenon predates Donald Trump's candidacy, but it helps explain a Trump puzzle that baffles many observers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, the puzzle is familiar. Trump repeatedly says things that seem (by conventional wisdom) hateful, offensive, stupid or simply wrong. But instead of these apparent missteps backfiring -- sowing doubt about his competence and moral values -- just the opposite happens. The more Trump flouts prevailing norms, the more popular he becomes among Republicans. The latest example: After proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which was widely criticized, his support among Republicans jumped to 38 percent in December from 32 percent in November, according to a Washington Post-ABC News survey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has not redefined politics, but he has exploited a fundamental change of recent decades. Since World War II, much of national politics has involved a struggle for economic benefits. In 1940, the government transferred about 7 percent of national income from some groups to others. Now, that share is nearly 20 percent. This remains a huge part of politics, as debates over highway spending, farm subsidies, taxes and so much more remind us. But spending decisions are incremental; sweeping shifts are unlikely. We're not going to abolish Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against this backdrop, politics is increasingly shaped by issues that are cast in moral terms: abortion, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, gay rights, global warming, guns, immigration and health care -- to name a few. Compared with most economic matters, these issues are much more combustible politically. On many economic questions, you can negotiate compromises that please, or displease, almost everyone equally. There's room for give-and-take. By contrast, compromises on moral questions are usually hard and often impossible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people who support these various moral crusades -- again, right and left -- are generally sincere. Liberals pledge to save the planet; conservatives vow to end illegal immigration. But their very passion suggests that they feel morally superior to their opponents and crave anything that strengthens their sense of superiority. They receive what I call ""psychic benefits,"" just as Social Security beneficiaries receive economic benefits. Significantly, these psychic benefits do not require the enactment of legislative agendas. Anything that makes your side look good or the other side look bad will suffice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What his supporters most like about Trump, even if they disagree with some of his policies (as some inevitably do), is that he defines himself -- he does not let others do it for him, and this rubs off on them. It's liberating. As he asserts his moral superiority over the judgments of the ""political establishment"" and ""mainstream media,"" so can his supporters defy others' hostile judgments of their values. In the contest for the high moral ground, they have a champion and a spokesman. They feel better about themselves. These are the psychic benefits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the ""political establishment"" and ""mainstream media"" -- admittedly ambiguous groups -- this poses a dilemma. When Trump makes proposals that strike them as simplistic, unworkable, undesirable or, worse, racist, they have two choices, both bad. If they decide not to react, their silence may seem to condone policies that they abhor. The second choice is to denounce many of Trump's ideas, but this plays into his hands because the more he is attacked by despised outsiders, the more popular and admired he becomes among supporters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What results is a bizarre, though fascinating, spectacle. Trump proposes. His opponents (pundits, politicians, ""experts"") pounce -- criticizing and fulminating. And Trump's popularity rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not inevitable that this cycle continue indefinitely. Trump may stumble. Some other candidate -- or candidates -- may soar. The avalanche of criticism may reach a critical mass, raising fresh doubts among some followers. Or Trump's outsize ego may begin to offend onetime allies. Politics is a fickle business. Still, Trump's success has so far stunned many veteran reporters and election observers who have underestimated his political skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more durable lesson here concerns the politics of self-esteem. Our system of governance is increasingly infused with a sanctimony all along the ideological spectrum that makes political accommodation and compromise harder to achieve. Well-intentioned people often act in rigid ways that maximize their self-esteem while perversely making it harder for the country to govern itself.</p></div>"			3					6

One year after California passed a referendum banning the use of race and ethnicity in public college admissions, the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians admitted to the University of California's two top campuses has dropped precipitously, leading to concern about the resegregation of higher education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But while the news from California is dismaying, a different, more encouraging story is being written in Texas, a state with political leaders who see diversity as a rich resource that benefits everyone, not only people of color.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year, a Federal court outlawed consideration of race in higher-education admissions in Texas. At the time, the state had been using high school grades and Scholastic Assessment Test scores along with <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> criteria to decide admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the ruling, a panel of professors and community activists joined a group of Hispanic and black lawmakers to persuade the State Legislature to adopt what has come to be called the 10 percent plan.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This eliminated the use of S.A.T. scores for Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school class and automatically admitted them to the two most selective public schools, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A & M University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At first, some critics objected that S.A.T. scores were indispensable measures of future success. But, as the advisory group of professors and activists pointed out, the best way to predict how a student will do in college is by measuring classroom performance in high school. This was borne out when achievement tests administered to the thousands of minority students admitted through the program showed that only a handful needed remedial education.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far the Texas plan has produced many winners. As of March of this year, 7 percent more black and 21 percent more Mexican-American applicants were eligible for enrollment under this system than under the old <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> guidelines. And access to public education has increased for white high school graduates in rural parts of Texas -- students who also tend not to do well on the S.A.T. and so had been refused admission to the most competitive public colleges under the old system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No wonder a number of moderate white legislators joined the coalition in supporting the plan. As State Representative Irma Rangel pointed out, the 10 percent plan treats all groups equally, giving them ''the respect they deserve.'' Similarly, when Gov. George Bush, a Republican, signed the bill, he declared, ''We want all our students in Texas to have a fair shot at achieving their dreams, and this legislation gives them that fair shot.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas officials recognize that there is more to be done beyond rethinking college admissions policy. They have also formulated new ideas for improving primary schools. Schools and districts are now required to report test scores, attendance and dropout rates by race, ethnicity and economic standing. Each school is then rated according to the performance of the various ethnic and economic groups. This means more attention is paid to every student, and the entire class benefits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, black, Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students are closing the achievement gap. On a national math test given in 1996, Texas fourth graders in various categories -- white, black and poor students -- all ranked first in the country. By contrast, California, where politicians have demonized issues of race, education and immigration, saw its fourth graders, including white students, finish near the bottom, ahead of those in only two other states.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas's innovative approaches, and its less polarized environment, are helping to shift an increasingly narrow debate over <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> into a wider public discussion on education. This also sends the message that access and diversity are not the enemy of excellence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Michael Bartalos)</p></div>"		1					3		
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/2419240626.xml.txt	"<div><p>The DOJ has been indispensable for 150 years. It needs a renewed emphasis on its founding spirit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WEDNESDAY MARKS the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice, which is both auspicious and, to many Americans, possibly surprising. Central as it is to American government, this Cabinet-level agency did not exist at the founding. There was little in the way of federal law, civil or criminal, until the Civil War. In the aftermath of that conflict, however, Congress established the department. The reformist purpose was to get rid of the expensive private attorneys — often party hacks — whom the federal government had previously hired to represent it, and to replace them with full-time professionals supervised by the attorney general. Simultaneously, Congress gave the department a new responsibility: to enforce the first-ever federal statutes designed to protect the civil rights of African Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Awareness of this history only compounds our dismay at the department's course under the Trump administration and the most recent attorney general, William P. Barr. Instead of impartiality and professionalism, there have been presidential interference with policy and personnel decisions and unjustified leniency for political favorites. Instead of an aggressive civil rights posture, there have been reluctance to investigate systemic violations by police departments, backing for lawsuits against <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> in college admissions and, from Mr. Barr himself, support for a police sweep of nonviolent protesters in Lafayette Square to make room for President Trump to stage a photo op.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some partisanship, real and perceived, is inevitable given that the ultimate power over federal law enforcement resides with politicians in Congress and the White House. In that sense, creating the department in 1870 was, at best, a partial fix for a dilemma inherent to the Constitution. From the beginning, and increasingly since the mushrooming of federal law enforcement authority in the 20th century, critics have accused the Justice Department of undermining the rule of law rather than upholding it, as anyone familiar with the careers of A. Mitchell Palmer or John N. Mitchell — or even Robert F. Kennedy — knows. The troubling covert surveillance warrants against Trump supporter Carter Page belong on that list, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way to reduce the risk of politicized or otherwise abusive federal law enforcement may be to reduce the sheer scope of federal criminal law, which has become overgrown and duplicative. As part of criminal justice reform, Congress should trim the excess, consistent both with the Constitution's assignment of primary responsibility for crime control to the states, and with the efficiency-promoting aims of the department's founders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, though, a large role for the Justice Department must remain — the legitimacy of which will depend on the ethos of its leaders, up to and including the president. Despite its imperfections, this is an indispensable institution; its career staff represents a vital national repository of public-spirited talent. These officials embody the legacy of reform and heightened independence in the post-Watergate years — a period that provides a hopeful precedent for today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than new policies or procedures, the Justice Department needs rededication to its founding spirit — professionalism and impartiality — and renewed emphasis on its oldest mission: civil rights. The Trump administration has shown itself incapable of that rededication. The next president and attorney general will have to do the job, urgently.</p></div>"	2			4

But then everything went to heck on the PR front, and evidently now you can say anything you want about the company, since any attempt to correct the record on its behalf is no longer ""credible.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By some transitive property that we don't fully understand, this even stripped the company of the presumption of innocence in legal matters. Journalists, no longer fearing Coke's efforts to hold them to the truth, no longer seem to hew to the cautious path they did a year ago. Thus Business Week's Dean Foust feels free to offer a lecture on what ""racist"" Coke must do to redeem itself because ""its Southern bottlers taunted and terrorized Coke's first black salesmen"" and ""legendary Chief Executive Robert S. Woodruff questioned civil rights legislation in the 1960s.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hmm, such throwaway journalism is hard to reconcile with a mountain of historical documentation. Mr. Woodruff is known to have urged Atlanta politicians to testify on behalf of the 1964 civil rights act. He used his clout to push a reluctant business community to embrace Martin Luther King Jr. And he was famous for railing against Jim Crow at every opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it seems peculiarly cavalier to blame Coke, when it was trying to integrate its sales force, for the racist behavior of Southern bottlers who were, after all, independent businessmen. He might as well dub Branch Rickey racist for sending Jackie Robinson out to suffer abuse at the hands of racist Dodger fans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an earlier article, the magazine celebrated Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer in the Coke case, because he ""unearthed tapes of Texaco managers making racist comments in meetings and leaked them to the New York Times."" But what Mr. Mehri really leaked was a transcript that falsely accused a Texaco executive of uttering the word ""nigger."" The word on the tape turned out to be ""Nicholas."" Texaco, all the while pleading it had done nothing wrong, nevertheless paid $176 million to make the headlines go away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wall Street doesn't care about rights and wrongs, though, and the demand for Coke to settle the current lawsuit has become intense too. We'll probably never know how the allegations of present-day discrimination would have stood up in court. All the more reason, then, for journalists to evince some skepticism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Mehri's latest smoking gun is Coke's own effort to assess and address the frustrations of black employees, initiated by then-president Doug Ivester. Mr. Mehri seems to believe all big corporations are intrinsically racist, so any evidence of them attending to racial matters is ipso facto evidence of racism.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, we've learned a few things after 30 years of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lawsuit, echoing Coke's internal review, complains that blacks are concentrated in human resources and public affairs rather than ""revenue generating areas."" History obviously plays a role here. A lot of companies put blacks where they would be visible to fellow employees and the outside world. But the subsequent ""clustering"" phenomenon has become a subject of thoughtful academic investigation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Harvard's Rosabeth Kanter pointed out long ago in a pioneering study of corporate women, when you arrive as a new recruit and look around and see nobody who looks like you, it's not a happy moment for most people. Those who follow in the same department are spared the trials of tokenism. Relax, experiment, work in spurts -- they are freer to do all the things that effective people do, rather than trying to seem perpetually busy, as people do who are under a microscope.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, workers tend to recruit others like themselves through personal connections, exactly what students of diversity say is a good way to set the ball rolling toward organizational change.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Coke, critics also fasten on the fact that, as noted by Coke's own internal review, scattered blacks felt the need to create informal networks for ""sanity checks.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet such groups are precisely what diversity experts recommend. Indeed, Coke may have gone too far recently in trying to officially sponsor such groups. One thing we've learned is the importance of informal networks to share information on how to get along and succeed. Everything isn't in the employee handbook.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Guess what? Hiring people isn't the same as truly integrating them. Outsiders like to imagine corporations as all-powerful authoritarian institutions that can decree changes in social reality. In fact companies can't do for employees what they must do for themselves. Sociologists have even coined the term ""social trap"" for the problems of tokenism and stigmatization that arise from clumsy corporate attempts at <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at least companies have shown a propensity to learn. Diversity is fact of life, like the weather and fluctuating government policy, which must be managed. Hence the new popularity of ""diversity management"" or the fine science of bending over backward to be fair to minorities without being unfair to others.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had the Texaco tapes fallen into competent journalistic hands, they would have told a story of a company in the throes of downsizing (the subject of most of the conversations on the tapes) but still wrestling with the need to recruit and promote minorities and women.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Coke's huge financial success over the last decade was due to the consolidation of its bottlers, but this also spawned an army of redundant staffers at headquarters to serve a dwindling bottler retinue. As the Atlanta Constitution reported, the joke around Coke's campus was that you would only have to work three months a year if you could just locate the other three people who are already doing your job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such companies, by definition, clog the pathways of upward advancement -- lo and behold, a key complaint in the bias lawsuit. This is another reason the case has become a media feast. In keeping with eternal corporate dynamic, Coke recently tried to undo a decade's worth of bloat by laying off 40% of its headquarters staff. Overnight, hundreds of employees discovered they had a grievance just as Mr. Mehri was fishing for class-action status.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But don't expect journalists to set black frustration at Coke into a larger context of employee frustration. When it comes to racial matters, their greatest fear is that somebody might catch them writing a complicated truth and interpret it as ""racist.""</p></div>"	2							6

And I’m not the only one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than two decades, I've tried to make sense of political currents in both parties, often to the consternation of readers on both sides. I've been called a corporatist and Republican apologist; more often, I'm called an elitist who pumps out Democratic talking points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all that time, I have not felt as utterly repulsed from the mainstream of both parties as I do right now. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job — a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans — Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich — who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote — that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party — more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point — would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here — that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before — in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party — or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control — and probably couldn't extinguish if he did. For me (and probably a lot of suburbanites voting this fall), this is more than a backdrop to his presidency. It's a dealbreaker.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their zeal to beat back Trumpism, the loudest Democratic groups have transformed into its Bizarro World imitators. Tossing aside ideals of equal opportunity and free expression, the new leftists obsess on identity as much as their adversaries do — but instead of trying to restore some obsolete notion of a White-dominated society, they seek vengeance under the guise of virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the bibles of this movement is a book called ""How to Be an Antiracist,"" in which Ibram X. Kendi declares: ""The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.""</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not — as the celebrated author claims — an expression of support for Lyndon B. Johnson-style <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which still makes sense to me. It is a case for the kind of social upheaval that occurred when foreign empires relinquished their colonies. It does not end well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals used to believe in civil debate about such ideas. But now, the arbiters of language are constantly issuing Soviet-style edicts about which terms are acceptable and which aren't (""woke"" was okay, now it's not) — a tactic used for controlling the debate and delegitimizing critics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can disagree about whether this radical uprising is necessary or politically self-destructive. But it's clearly not in keeping with the principles that are supposed to unite the country.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I was taught — and still believe — that in the United States, we are bound not by common origin, language or culture but by a series of laws and values that make us who we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As long as you swear allegiance to those laws and values — racial equality, free speech, unfettered worship — then you're no more or less American than anyone else, and no less deserving of respect, protection and opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That we've failed to honor that promise over the life of the country, and are failing still, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and abandon the project. It means you rededicate yourself to the ideal of true equality, rather than reducing individuals to a box on a census form.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the ideology that both parties used to call liberalism. There is no longer room for it in today's stark political dichotomy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In part, it's a testimony to the damage that one shameless and unprincipled man managed to wreak on our politics. Trump always had a talent for bringing out the worst in everyone; more than a year after leaving office, he remains the decaying star by which everyone else in our political solar system must orient themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's also the result of an antiquated primary system — at the presidential level and below — that plays to an ever-winnowing group of fervent believers in both parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more people grow disgusted with extremist party politics, the more only those extremists are heard and the more power they exert on anyone who wants to run for higher office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is about the point where some (most likely some in my own business) will scream: ""Both sidesism!"" That's the now-cliche argument that any criticism of Democrats whatsoever must be some kind of journalistic reflex to equate the parties, when clearly one is worse than the other.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is worse than the other. But that doesn't mean we have to feel jazzed about supporting a party that would grade our worthiness as people on a sliding scale of identity. It doesn't change the fact that the broad center of the American electorate — traditional conservatives and liberals both — no longer has a political home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So where do we go?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, I've predicted the eventual triumph of an independent president, outside the two-party system. That candidate hasn't emerged, but the lane for a credible independent has never been wider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's also the probability that some reformist Democratic governor or political novice is looking at the political landscape and thinking that, if you could unify that liberal constituency inside the party, you might just be able to commandeer it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've never been very good at predicting the path ahead. What I do know is that politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum — and, one way or another, a force will arise to fill the space at the eye of our destructive political storm.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until then, you can call me a dissenter.</p></div>"	2						3

sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/409108213.xml.txt	"<div><p>Two Little Words: (1) Advice, (2) Consent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives believe that every word of the Constitution should be ""strictly construed"" according to its ""plain meaning"" and the ""original intent"" of the men who wrote it. Every word, that is, except two: ""advice"" and ""consent."" The plain meaning of these words is not hard to fathom, nor is their authors' intent. Senatorial ""advice and consent"" on the president's judicial nominations was a compromise between those who thought the president should appoint judges and those who thought Congress should do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least when the White House is Republican and the Senate is Democratic, however, conservatives discover all sorts of doctrines in the word ""consent"" that are far from clear to the naked eye. Senators musn't consider the nominee's ideology. They must never ask or consider how the nominee might vote on specific issues or cases. As for the word ""advice,"" fuggedabadit. At Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Tuesday about standards for approving judicial nominations, all the energy on the conservative side was about piling limitations on the Senate's power of consent. Only a liberal suggested that maybe the Constitution is trying to tell us that presidents should seek the Senate's advice in choosing his nominees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's straighten out a few concepts here. Ideology can mean the sum of your views on all political issues: welfare, taxes, trade with China, etc. Yes, of course, senators should not consider a would-be judge's politics -- except to ensure as best they can that the judge won't consider them either in his or her rulings. But ideology can also mean your specific philosophy on judicial matters: the role of precedent, the meaning of the 14th Amendment, and so on. And senators of course can and should inquire about this kind of ideology and vote yea or nea on that basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives generally accept this distinction. But they muddle it by presenting their own preferred judicial ideology -- a flurry of bromidic phrases: ""judicial restraint,"" ""strict construction,"" ""original intent"" -- as a piety beyond legitimate dispute. So any liberal challenge to a conservative nominee is automatically ""ideological"" in the bad sense, while every conservative challenge to a liberal nominee is based on philosophical principle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conservatives' judicial philosophy is not beyond legitimate dispute. First of all, they themselves happily overlook it when it is inconvenient. ""Advice and consent"" is a ripe example. <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">Affirmative action</span> is another: Conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn policies of the elected branches. They sincerely believe, no doubt, that this is a case where the Constitution speaks clearly and judicial restraint is inappropriate. But that's the point: Their buzzwords don't provide an unfailing guide even for them, let alone a beacon of truth so bright that the path it illuminates is the only one worth taking. Waving a wand called ""strict construction"" can't fully illuminate purposely vague phrases like ""cruel and unusual."" Invoking ""original intent"" won't tell you what the authors' original intent was about dealing with changing circumstances.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If ""advice and consent"" is entitled to anything close to its plain, original meaning, the Senate is perfectly entitled to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject some on that basis. Scrutiny includes asking nominees their views and their reasoning about fairly specific legal issues, if not actual pending cases. Why not? After all, sitting judges write long opinions day after day telling us what they think about many issues that will come up again, but no one regards that as a problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Needless to say, it would be wrong for Senate Democrats to let considerations of sauce for the gander influence their thinking on this issue. President Bush would never let political considerations influence his judicial choices. When he campaigned last fall on a promise to nominate justices like Scalia and Thomas, he must have had in mind some other way in which those two gentlemen are alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for eight years of Republican harassment and blocking of President Clinton's nominees, Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed at Tuesday's hearing that this is entirely a figment of your imagination. That's right -- it never happened! His ""proof"": almost as many Clinton nominees as Reagan nominees ultimately got confirmed. Of course this says nothing one way or another about how many were blocked and had to be replaced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clint Bolick, director of legal affairs for the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy and head of the so-called Institute for Justice, also testified on Tuesday. Bolick noted that his organization didn't oppose any of Clinton's Supreme Court nominees. He did not mention his ferocious campaign against Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's nominee for head of civil rights at the Justice Department. Ordinarily, a president's choices for his own administration are thought to deserve more deference, not less, than his nominations for lifetime appointments to the independent judiciary. But an Institute of Justice press release at the time (1997 again) argued that the advice and consent clause actually obliges senators to oppose nominees with erroneous views ""when the stakes are high enough."" The stakes in this case were in essence that Bolick's group favored judicial activism -- judges overthrowing <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> plans -- and Lee did not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Institute of Justice Web site describes it as dedicated to opposing ""racial preferences"" and ""the welfare state"" and as a ""courtroom champion"" for ""free market solutions and limited government."" But Bolick testified Tuesday that ""mere philosophical differences"" shouldn't play a role in the Senate's approval of judges -- and, what's more, they never had. To start now would be ""a sea change,"" he said. Bolick quoted Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy in 1997 denouncing the practice of ""blue slipping"" -- individual senators blocking judicial nominees from their state. He didn't explain why Leahy should be so upset about something that didn't exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate (www.slate.com), writes a weekly column for The Post.</p></div>"	2			4

Others may see this moment as an isolated event rather than the result of the hard work of Black female candidates, political strategists and voters who have participated in the building of the Democratic Party.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both would be a mistake.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Harris is the embodiment of the growing political power of Black women to make demands within the Democratic Party — and the political sophistication to ensure that those demands are met.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many recent elections, Black women voters have turned out at higher rates than any other demographic. More than 90 percent of Black women have cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections. In 2008 and 2012 they had the highest turnout rate among all racial, ethnic and gender groups. No other major demographic is as loyal to either party as Black people. And Black women have become increasingly organized and focused on making that support meaningful for themselves and their community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That kind of turnout and loyalty doesn’t just happen. Largely without any major investment from the Democratic Party, Black women have worked through grass-roots organizations to register new voters and motivate them to cast ballots. The work of groups like the New Georgia Project to transform the electoral landscape of the South has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new voters. In Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017. Across the country, Black congresswomen like Lucy McBath of Georgia, Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts have run for office and won historic victories.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Black women have also formed organizations to support and encourage more Black women to run for office and maximize their political power. Glynda Carr’s Higher Heights for America, Aimee Allison’s She The People and Leah Daughtry’s Power Rising are examples of organizations that convene discussions with African-American women, empower those who want to run for office and insist that candidates answer questions that are important to Black women. During the Democratic primaries, nearly every candidate showed up to discuss his or her views about race and gender at a forum held by She The People in April. They understood that their road to the White House is paved not just by Black women’s votes but also by their labor as volunteers, community influencers and, increasingly, important donors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, this moment is decades in the making. A century ago this month, women demanded and earned the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment. In that effort, African-American women were often asked to march behind white women and participate in segregated rallies. Most Black women didn’t get access to the ballot until the Voting Rights Act was passed 45 years later. African-American women understood the power of the vote to choose candidates who would enact policies that either helped or hindered their quest for equal rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation’s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups. They are keenly aware that all forms of oppression disproportionately affect Black women; consequently, Black women’s movements have always been inclusive even when that inclusion was not reciprocated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So the selection of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s vice-presidential running mate is bigger than an individual choice. It is not just about this one Black woman and her success. The selection is a win for Black women politicians who have higher political ambitions, Black women operatives who want to have more say in how campaigns are run, and Black women voters who want to see themselves among the many candidates the party fields every election.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kamala Harris stands on the shoulders of giants in the Democratic Party who broke down barriers — the congresswomen Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and political operatives like Donna Brazile and Minyon Moore. Millions of Black women and their political labor have made this historic day possible. Ms. Harris’s selection represents a major step forward in Black women’s political ascendance and not a single victory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melanye Price (@ProfMTP), a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, is the author, most recently, of “The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.”</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p></div>"	2							6	
sylvan	aa_opeds_sample/txt/408654746.xml.txt	"<div><p>Mr. Lieberman's Debut</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOSEPH LIEBERMAN introduced himself to the American people last night, and was introduced by his wife and others, as a classic American story--the first in his family to graduate from college, the son of a father who worked nights and a mother who valued family and education. Much has been made of his status as the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president, but his message was the universality of the American dream and of the values that motivate him--faith, family, hard work, public service, equal opportunity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was an affecting speech, well received in the convention hall. But the senator's challenge went beyond making a good first impression. Some of the very qualities that recommended him to Al Gore also represent sources of tension now that he is on the ticket. His reputation for integrity stems in part from his criticism of Clinton-Gore fundraising excesses and of President Clinton's ethical lapses. His reputation for innovative thinking and bipartisanship stems in part from questioning policies that remain sacrosanct in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Since his selection, the George Bush campaign has even portrayed Mr. Lieberman as closer to its views than to Mr. Gore's--somehow not a real Democrat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So last night Mr. Lieberman portrayed himself as very much in the mainstream of Democratic thinking. He wrapped himself in the language of civil rights and a fair distribution of national prosperity. Whatever differences he might have with some Democrats, he seemed to say--or with Al Gore--pale next to differences between the parties. In so doing, he glossed over some of his past independent stands. There was no mention of President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal, which the senator bravely criticized in the past, nor of the fundraising coffees at the White House, which Mr. Gore attended. Likewise, he endorsed <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span>, which he has questioned, and was mute on tort reform or school vouchers, two policies that Mr. Lieberman has sympathized with. Tort reform is anathema to the trial bar, which donates lavishly to Democratic campaign coffers. School vouchers appall the teachers' unions; teachers account for some 12 percent of the delegates at the convention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Sen. Lieberman emphasized areas in which he and Mr. Gore agree, such as health care, the Democrats' favorite issue this year. He sought to draw a distinction between Democrats and Gov. George W. Bush on the environment. He warned that the Republicans' tax plans would benefit the wealthy, slighting Social Security and Medicare. And on the crusade against indecency in popular culture, not popular in Hollywood, he claimed kinship with Al and Tipper Gore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Lieberman in the past has been refreshingly willing to acknowledge the complexities of issues such as <span style=""background-color:yellow;"">affirmative action</span> and the failings of public schools. One question now is whether the Gore ticket can offer new ideas without venturing outside the confines imposed by the Democratic Party's core constituents. Education is a test case, even though the federal role in this area is limited. Mr. Lieberman avoided the radioactive subject of vouchers, but he did declare that ""schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability."" That may prove more radical than it sounds, depending on how it translates into policy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats have held the White House for two terms in part by convincing Americans that they are the party that fights, as Mr. Lieberman said last night, to find ""room for everybody"" around the table of American prosperity. But they also have succeeded by separating themselves enough from their traditional positions to look fresh. They have become the party of fiscal responsibility and are willing to see that government programs must be enlivened with new management styles (hence Mr. Gore's talk of reinventing government) and with competition (hence the Democrats' support for charter schools). This openness needs to be preserved. ""We can change, we can challenge, we can agree to disagree,"" one speaker declared on Tuesday night. That speaker was Jesse Jackson, in some ways the champion of traditionalists.</p></div>"			3					6
