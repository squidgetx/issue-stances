-1	against	"The text presents a nuanced view on affirmative action, discussing both critiques and defenses of the policy. It acknowledges the complexities and potential shortcomings of affirmative action, such as its zero-sum nature and the possibility that it may not always serve the most disadvantaged within minority groups. It also recognizes the historical context of racial discrimination and the need for measures to ensure inclusion of African Americans at all societal levels.

The text suggests that while affirmative action has its limits, completely abandoning it could have negative repercussions, particularly in the perception of African Americans feeling rejected by society. It calls for a balanced debate that honors the truths of both supporters and opponents, and it advocates for a broader discussion on how to achieve equality of opportunity for all, regardless of race.

Given the text's balanced exploration of the issue, without a clear leaning towards outright support or opposition, the stance on affirmative action can be classified as **None**.

1	favor	"The provided text contains multiple opinions from different individuals regarding affirmative action in college admissions. Here is the classification of each individual's stance:

1. Mallory Duncan, Paris: Favor
Mallory Duncan argues for the continuation of affirmative action, pointing out the historical biases that have favored certain groups and the need to redress these biases by shifting some advantages towards students of color and economically disadvantaged students.

2. Michael Farzan, Juno Beach, Fla.: Favor
Michael Farzan supports affirmative action but suggests that it should also explicitly include economic status as a factor. He criticizes President Trump's approach as divisive and implies support for a more inclusive form of affirmative action.

3. Tom O'Hare, Boston: Against
Tom O'Hare argues that affirmative action is condescending to African-Americans and Latinos and that it promotes the injustices it aims to solve. He advocates for equal treatment without consideration of race, suggesting that people should be judged by their abilities rather than their skin color.

4. Tom Barnard, Shaker Heights, Ohio: Favor
Tom Barnard questions why the Trump administration is against the use of race for diversity in education but does not address gender. He points out the inconsistency in accepting gender diversity but not racial diversity, implying support for affirmative action based on race.

In summary:
- Mallory Duncan: Favor
- Michael Farzan: Favor
- Tom O'Hare: Against
- Tom Barnard: Favor"	0.012380000000000002	affirmative action	txt/2065977608.xml.txt

1	favor	The text provided presents a nuanced view of affirmative action. The author initially seems to be against their son's stance, which is critical of affirmative action. However, as the text progresses, the author reflects on the complexities of the issue and acknowledges that while the program has its flaws, it still serves a purpose in addressing social disadvantages. The son's final stance, which the author agrees with, suggests a modified approach to equal opportunity that is not solely based on race but also on individual circumstances and effort. Therefore, the text's stance on affirmative action is ultimately in favor, with a call for a more selective and nuanced application of the policy.	0.01277	affirmative action	txt/421552708.xml.txt
