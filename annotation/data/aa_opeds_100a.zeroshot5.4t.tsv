Nevertheless, it’s an important move: The Post cites it as 'a prime example of the sort that should survive judicial scrutiny.' Texas’s 'top 10 percent program' guarantees admission for students in the top 10 percent of every public high-school graduating class, but the U.T. Austin 'fills the rest of its classes with students who get in under a comprehensive, holistic review of their academic and personal records.'

The author also notes the importance of outreach programs to increase eligibility rates of underprivileged high school graduates, suggesting support for measures that aim to provide opportunities for disadvantaged students.

2	neutral	"The author's stance on affirmative action is complex and nuanced, reflecting an understanding of the arguments both for and against the policy. The author acknowledges the criticisms of affirmative action, such as it being a zero-sum game, not addressing class inequality, and potentially benefiting those within a privileged group who may not need it. However, the author also recognizes the historical context of racial discrimination and the need to ensure African Americans have opportunities in society.

The author calls for a balanced view, suggesting that opponents of affirmative action must understand that achieving true equality of opportunity requires significant intervention, while supporters must recognize its limitations and the genuine concerns of those who feel disadvantaged by the policy.

Given the balanced nature of the discussion, which neither fully endorses nor completely rejects affirmative action, but rather calls for a more inclusive and fair approach to equality of opportunity, the author's stance can be classified as neutral. The author is seeking a middle ground that addresses the complexities of the issue and the legitimate concerns of both sides."	0.017830000000000002	affirmative action	txt/307867242.xml.txt	3

Therefore, the author's stance on affirmative action can be inferred as ""somewhat against"" or ""strongly against,"" depending on how strongly one interprets the critique of judicial activism and the advocacy for a colorblind Constitution.

Instead, it discusses the Voting Rights Act of 1965, its constitutional basis, its historical impact, and the author's perspective on its contemporary implications, particularly regarding the political polarization and the practice of racial gerrymandering.

The author raises concerns about the unintended consequences of the Voting Rights Act, such as political polarization along racial lines and the potential limitations it places on minority politicians in terms of rising to higher office. While acknowledging the historical importance and successes of the Act in combating voter discrimination and securing the franchise for black voters, the author also suggests that the Act may no longer be as necessary as it once was, given the changes in voting patterns and the absence of the kind of blunt voter suppression that existed in 1965.

In conclusion, the author's stance on the Voting Rights Act is nuanced, recognizing its past successes but questioning its current form and application.

0	strongly_against	The author’s stance on affirmative action can be inferred as somewhat against or strongly against. The text criticizes the ideological homogeneity of academia and suggests that affirmative action in academic contexts excludes individuals who do not align with certain political or ideological perspectives. The author mentions that if one disapproves of affirmative action, pursuing a degree in African-American studies would be unfeasible, implying a negative view of affirmative action's role in academic inclusivity. However, without explicit language condemning affirmative action as a policy, it is difficult to classify the stance as strongly against.

The author critiques Lino Graglia's negative comments about minority students and suggests that socioeconomic factors and historical context are important considerations that Graglia overlooks. The author advocates for open dialogue and education on issues of race and seems to support the idea that minority groups have potential to succeed, as exemplified by the history of Italian-American immigrants. However, the author also defends Graglia's right to express his views, emphasizing the importance of free speech.

Given the nuances in the text, it is difficult to categorize the author's stance definitively without further context. The author does not seem to be strongly against affirmative action, as they recognize the complexities surrounding minority achievement and the potential for success. They also do not appear to be strongly in favor, as they do not explicitly endorse affirmative action policies. The author's stance may lean towards being somewhat in favor of affirmative action due to the acknowledgment of historical and socioeconomic factors affecting minority achievement and the need for dialogue, but this is not clearly stated.
