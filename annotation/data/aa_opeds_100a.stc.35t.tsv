He also points out problematic cliches from the political right, aiming to provide balance to Goldberg's arguments.	"The text provided is a commentary by Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune's editorial board, discussing Jonah Goldberg's book titled ""The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas.""

1	The text discusses the specific case of Elizabeth Warren's identification as a minority law professor and the implications of using her supposed Native American heritage for diversity purposes.	somewhat_against	The author criticizes the use of Elizabeth Warren's unverified Native American ancestry to promote diversity in academia, arguing for a more genuine approach to diversity based on a range of experiences and perspectives.	"The text discusses Elizabeth Warren's identification as a ""minority"" law professor in the 1980s and 1990s, based on a belief in her Native American ancestry. The author criticizes the way Warren's distant connection to a Cherokee ancestor was used by institutions like Harvard Law School to showcase diversity, despite the lack of concrete evidence. The author argues that while diversity in academia is important, it should be based on a genuine range of experiences and perspectives rather than meeting ethnic quotas. The text highlights the irony of Warren's situation, where her blue-collar background was overshadowed by the emphasis on her supposed Native American heritage. The author suggests that the focus on superficial diversity, rather than meaningful inclusion, is a flawed approach that needs to be reconsidered by academic institutions."	0.0010285	affirmative action	txt/1014285656.xml.txt	0
1	The discussion of affirmative action is part of a broader critique of Reagan's ideology and its consequences on issues like inequality.	somewhat_against	The author, Drew Westen, is critical of Reagan's stance on affirmative action and its impact on American politics and society.	"The text provided discusses the importance of having a clear vision in politics, drawing parallels between historical figures like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, and the current presidential candidates. The author, Drew Westen, criticizes both Mitt Romney and President Obama for failing to offer a compelling vision that resonates with the American people. Westen highlights the influence of money in politics, the caution of the candidates, and the historical context of past presidencies in shaping the current lack of a clear vision in American politics. The author also critiques Reagan's ideology and its lasting impact on American politics, particularly in relation to issues like affirmative action and inequality.

Westen's perspective on affirmative action seems critical as he suggests that Reagan's opposition to government programs like affirmative action was part of a broader critique of government overreach. He implies that Reagan's stance resonated with white working-class males who felt challenged by affirmative action and other social changes. Westen argues that Reagan's deregulation efforts, while aimed at reducing government power, ultimately led to increased corruption and inequality, with negative consequences for ordinary Americans. Overall, the author seems to view affirmative action within the broader context of political ideologies and their impact on societal issues like inequality."	0.0012915000000000001	affirmative action	txt/1022742622.xml.txt	0
2	The discussion of Chief Justice Roberts's decision in a high-profile case and its potential implications for future decisions on controversial issues like affirmative action highlights the author's perspective on the broader impact of judicial decisions.	neutral	The author discusses Chief Justice John Roberts's decision in a specific case and speculates on the potential motivations behind it, suggesting that the decision may have been influenced by factors beyond a strict interpretation of the law.	"The text discusses Chief Justice John Roberts's decision in the National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius case, where he upheld the individual mandate as a tax. The author explores the speculation that Roberts's decision was motivated by a desire to preserve the integrity and reputation of the Supreme Court, especially in a politically polarized environment. The text questions whether Roberts's decision was influenced by concerns about public perception and the court's image, rather than a strict interpretation of the law. The author also highlights the contrast between liberal justices who align with the Democratic Party's desired outcomes and conservative justices who adhere to constitutional limits.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is implied that Chief Justice Roberts's decision in the healthcare case could impact future decisions on hot-button issues like affirmative action, gay marriage, and the Voting Rights Act. The author suggests that Roberts's decision may have been influenced by a desire to earn political capital for future cases, raising questions about the integrity of the court's decisions."	0.0011259999999999998	affirmative action	txt/1023015447.xml.txt	0
0	The author's perspective is relevant in the context of discussions on affirmative action and its impact on equality and discrimination.	strongly_against	The author criticizes the Obama administration's support for affirmative action in university admissions, arguing that it leads to discrimination based on race and goes against the principle of treating all individuals equally.	"The author of the text is critical of the Obama administration's stance on affirmative action in university admissions. The author argues that considering race as a factor in admissions, even under the pretense of promoting diversity, ultimately leads to discrimination based on race or ethnicity. The author believes that treating all individuals equally, regardless of race, is a fundamental American principle and that affirmative action policies contradict this principle. The author uses the analogy of ""destroying the village in order to save it"" to emphasize their perspective on the negative consequences of affirmative action."	0.0005425	affirmative action	txt/1034256694.xml.txt	0
1	The analysis of Chief Justice Roberts's stance on affirmative action is central to understanding his potential decisions in cases involving race-based considerations.	somewhat_against	The author's perspective is based on Chief Justice Roberts's past conservative positions and questioning during the Fisher case, implying skepticism towards affirmative action.	"The text discusses Chief Justice John Roberts's questioning during oral arguments in the Fisher v. University of Texas case, which involves racial preferences in college admissions. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, claims she was denied admission based on her race, while the university argues that considering race is necessary to achieve a diverse student body. The author suggests that Chief Justice Roberts's questioning during the oral arguments indicates he is unlikely to consistently side with the liberal wing of the Supreme Court on issues like affirmative action. The author emphasizes Roberts's past conservative positions on issues such as redistricting and affirmative action, indicating his support for ""true equality and ending discrimination.""

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as reflected in Chief Justice Roberts's previous rulings and questioning during the Fisher case, suggests a skepticism or reluctance towards policies that involve race-based considerations in admissions. The author implies that Roberts is more inclined towards a color-blind approach to the law and is unlikely to fully support affirmative action measures."	0.000763	affirmative action	txt/1099415355.xml.txt	0
1	The discussion on the Voting Rights Act and its implications for affirmative action is relevant as it addresses the broader impact of legislation aimed at promoting minority rights in the political sphere.	somewhat_against	The author presents a critical perspective on the Voting Rights Act, suggesting that while it was crucial in securing minority voting rights, its enforcement may have unintended consequences like racial gerrymandering and political polarization. The author implies that the VRA may need reevaluation in the current political context.	The author discusses the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act and presents a perspective on affirmative action. The author argues that while the VRA was designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting and has been reauthorized by Congress, it has unintended consequences such as greater political polarization along racial lines. The author highlights that the VRA, as interpreted and enforced, leads to racial gerrymandering that may limit the rise of minority candidates. Despite acknowledging the benefits of the VRA in securing minority enfranchisement, the author suggests that the law may no longer be fully relevant in the current political landscape and that it could be time for a reevaluation of its impact. The author implies that the Supreme Court may rule against the VRA, citing concerns about its real-world consequences and potential disconnection from the present time, which could spark a debate on how to protect voting rights while restoring political balance.	0.0010854999999999999	affirmative action	txt/1370789528.xml.txt	0
2	The text is relevant as it discusses the nuances of the Supreme Court Justices' perspectives and voting behaviors, especially on contentious issues like affirmative action.	neutral	The author provides a detailed analysis of the voting patterns and alignments of Supreme Court Justices, particularly focusing on the three female justices and their differences on certain key issues like affirmative action.	"The text discusses the voting patterns and alignments of the Supreme Court Justices, particularly focusing on the three female justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. These three justices are noted to be the most liberal on the court and tend to vote together frequently. The text also highlights Justice Stephen G. Breyer's divergence from the liberal wing in certain cases. It mentions the dominance of the female justices during Supreme Court arguments in the last term, with Justice Sotomayor being particularly highlighted due to her memoir and public appearances. Despite their ideological similarities, the text notes instances where the female justices were divided on significant cases like same-sex marriage and affirmative action.

Regarding affirmative action, the author's perspective suggests that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor were divided on the issue, with Justice Ginsburg filing a lone dissent in a case related to the University of Texas's affirmative action plan. The author acknowledges the ideological similarity of the three female justices but also points out instances where they did not fully agree on certain key issues."	0.001272	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	0
3	The text's focus on racism, inequality, and societal challenges related to race relations is relevant to the discussion of affirmative action and its role in promoting equality.	somewhat_in_favor	The author does not explicitly mention affirmative action, but the discussion of racial tensions and inequalities in society suggests a belief in the importance of addressing systemic discrimination.	"The text discusses the reaction to the NBA's decision to ban Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life due to racist remarks he made. The author, Steve Lopez, presents the perspective of individuals from a South Los Angeles barbershop, including Lawrence Tolliver, who express their disdain for Sterling's comments and behavior. Tolliver and others in the barbershop view Sterling's actions as reflective of a larger issue of racism and inequality in society. They criticize Sterling's past behavior, question the motives behind his charitable donations, and highlight the ongoing challenges related to race relations in the country. The text also touches upon differing opinions within the barbershop, with one individual questioning the focus on Sterling compared to other societal issues like the objectification of women and glorification of gangs in popular culture.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, the text does reference a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that suggests a potential shift away from affirmative action. The author seems to highlight the ongoing racial tensions and inequalities in society, which may imply a belief in the importance of affirmative action as a tool to address systemic discrimination and promote equality."	0.0012920000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1519805309.xml.txt	0
3	The author's perspective is focused on the specific affirmative-action program at the University of Texas at Austin and the legal battle surrounding it.	somewhat_in_favor	The author supports the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative-action program as a necessary effort to promote diversity and considers it constitutional.	"The text discusses the ongoing legal battle over the affirmative-action program at the University of Texas at Austin. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit recently upheld the university's admissions policies, arguing that they are constitutional and that the program is a carefully designed effort to achieve diversity. The text highlights the complexity of affirmative action cases, with arguments for and against the policy. It also points out the lack of clear guidance from the Supreme Court on what constitutes constitutionally acceptable affirmative action in public universities.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive of the University of Texas at Austin's program. They argue that the university's affirmative-action policy, which complements the race-neutral top 10 percent program, is a cautious and necessary effort to promote diversity and consider individual student profiles. The author calls for the Supreme Court to provide clearer guidance on affirmative action in public universities and ultimately supports the university's affirmative-action program as permissible and beneficial for achieving diversity."	0.000889	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	0
1	The discussion of campus sexual assault cases and the challenges faced by universities in adjudicating these cases is relevant to the broader debate on due process and fairness in campus procedures, which can be extended to other policies like affirmative action.	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text. However, based on the emphasis on due process, fairness, and criticism of current guidelines prioritizing the rights of the accuser over the accused, it can be inferred that the author might have a similar critical stance towards affirmative action policies.	"The text discusses the complexities of handling campus sexual assault cases, focusing on the case of Paul Nungesser, a Columbia student accused of raping Emma Sulkowicz. The author highlights the challenges faced by universities in adjudicating these cases due to pressure from the Department of Education to handle sexual grievances themselves. The author criticizes the current guidelines that prioritize the rights of the accuser over the accused, leading to concerns about due process and fairness in campus procedures. The author suggests that universities should push back against these guidelines, seek clarification on definitions of sexual misconduct, and adopt a ""reasonable-person test"" to determine guilt or innocence. Additionally, the author advocates for universities to collaborate with law enforcement agencies to address sexual violence cases more effectively.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the current system and calls for a reevaluation of the guidelines set by the Department of Education. The author emphasizes the importance of due process and fairness for both the accuser and the accused in campus sexual assault cases, suggesting that the current approach may undermine the credibility of campus procedures."	0.0013565	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	0
2	The author's perspective on affirmative action is relevant in the context of discussing how universities should prioritize issues that directly impact educational processes and outcomes.	neutral	The author emphasizes the importance of universities focusing on their educational mission and expresses concerns about the practicality and moral implications of divestment campaigns. The author also argues against universities taking partisan positions on political issues, suggesting a focus on educational outcomes and diversity of viewpoints.	"The text discusses the rising trend of campaigns urging colleges and universities to divest stock holdings, particularly focusing on fossil fuel companies. The author presents arguments against divestment, such as practical difficulties, concerns about the impact on endowments, and doubts about its effectiveness in bringing about changes. The author argues against the idea that universities are obligated to take a stand on every issue of social importance and emphasizes the importance of maintaining focus on the educational mission. The author expresses concerns about the moral perils of divestment, including hypocrisy, honoring donor intent, and the risk of diverting attention from more pressing educational issues. The author also highlights the need for educational institutions to prioritize improving educational outcomes and controlling costs. Overall, the author is critical of divestment campaigns and emphasizes the importance of focusing on core educational missions and making meaningful contributions to the common good.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it directly affects educational processes and outcomes, making it a more relevant issue for academia compared to other political issues. The author argues that universities should prioritize their primary educational mission of being open to diverse viewpoints rather than taking partisan positions on political issues. This suggests that the author sees affirmative action as a legitimate and important issue within the educational context."	0.0011505	affirmative action	txt/1667204395.xml.txt	0
2	The text discusses the challenges faced by universities in developing hate speech policies and the potential implications for affirmative action.	neutral	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, presents a critical perspective on affirmative action in the context of hate speech policies, emphasizing the importance of free speech rights.	"The text discusses the challenges faced by the University of California regents in developing a hate speech policy on campuses, particularly in response to recent anti-Semitic incidents. The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, highlights the difficulty in balancing the commitment to freedom of speech with the need to prevent hateful speech. He explains the complexities of defining hate speech and the potential constitutional issues that arise when trying to regulate it.

Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action in the context of hate speech policies is critical. He questions whether advocating for affirmative action could be considered a violation of policies against hate speech, as it may be perceived as stigmatizing racial minorities. He emphasizes the importance of upholding the 1st Amendment right to express all viewpoints, even those that may be controversial or offensive.

Chemerinsky suggests that a policy focusing on reaffirming free expression while clearly defining what is not constitutionally protected could be a potential solution. He argues that universities have the right to speak out against inflammatory speech targeting their community members and encourages a balanced approach that upholds free speech while addressing impermissible speech and conduct.

Overall, Chemerinsky's perspective underscores the complexities and legal considerations involved in developing hate speech policies on university campuses, particularly in relation to issues like affirmative action and the protection of free speech rights."	0.001144	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	0
2	The author's perspective on affirmative action is discussed in the context of a broader analysis of the impact of moral issues on modern politics.	neutral	The author discusses the concept of the 'politics of self-esteem,' where individuals engage in moral crusades to feel morally superior to their opponents, highlighting how this affects modern politics.	"The author discusses the concept of the ""politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals become politically engaged to raise their self-esteem. The author uses Donald Trump's candidacy as an example, explaining how his unconventional behavior and controversial statements actually increase his popularity among supporters. The author highlights a shift in politics from primarily economic issues to moral issues, such as affirmative action, gay rights, and immigration, which are more polarizing and less amenable to compromise. The author suggests that individuals on both the right and left engage in moral crusades to feel morally superior to their opponents, gaining ""psychic benefits"" from supporting their causes. The author concludes that this focus on self-esteem in politics hinders compromise and governance.

Regarding affirmative action, the author seems to view it as one of the moral issues that shape modern politics. The author implies that individuals on both sides of the political spectrum use affirmative action as a way to feel morally superior to their opponents and gain psychic benefits. The author suggests that the debate around affirmative action, like other moral issues, is highly combustible politically and difficult to compromise on."	0.0010935	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	0

3	The text discusses the disparities faced by high-achieving low-income students in college admissions and proposes a solution to address these inequities.	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, advocates for the implementation of a 'poverty preference' or affirmative action for low-income students in college admissions.	"Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation and former chancellor of the New York City schools, discusses the inequities in college admissions faced by high-achieving low-income students. He highlights the disparity in access to elite colleges, where students from wealthy families have a significant advantage due to legacy preferences, athletic preferences, test preparation resources, and early admissions programs. Levy argues that there is a need for a ""poverty preference"" or affirmative action for low-income students to level the playing field in college admissions. He suggests that while standardized tests should not be eliminated, admissions officers should give more weight to the achievements of low-income students who have succeeded despite facing obstacles. Levy emphasizes the importance of providing equal opportunities for all academically qualified students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, to ensure fairness and merit-based admissions."	0.0009995	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	0
3	The text is focused on the need for political pluralism in academia and how it can enhance civil discourse and research interests.	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective is that affirmative action in academia should be expanded to address the lack of political diversity, particularly the underrepresentation of conservatives in social sciences.	"The text discusses the underrepresentation of conservatives in academia, particularly in the social sciences, and suggests that this imbalance warrants new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia. The authors present data showing the lack of Republican professors in social science fields compared to other disciplines and highlight that conservative students may avoid these fields due to feeling uncomfortable in classes that touch on politics. The authors argue that the lack of political diversity in academia hinders civil discourse, limits research interests, and leads to confirmation bias. They propose modest reforms, such as stopping the barring of conservative speakers and considering advertising positions in fields more popular among conservatives, to make academia more welcoming to conservatives.

The authors' perspective on affirmative action in academia is that it should not only focus on remedying historical discrimination but also on increasing political diversity to enhance civil discourse and the pursuit of truth. They suggest that universities should prioritize diversity of thought and viewpoints, including conservative perspectives, to create a more balanced and intellectually rich academic environment."	0.0011719999999999999	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	0

The author emphasizes the importance of universities being able to use a race-conscious approach to promote diversity.	"The text discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling in favor of the University of Texas at Austin's admissions process, which considers race as one of many factors in achieving a diverse student body. The author supports the decision, emphasizing the importance of universities being able to use a race-conscious approach to promote diversity. The author highlights Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion that universities have the right to define characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to their mission. The text also mentions the dissenting opinions of some justices, like Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito, who argue against considering race in college admissions.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, as they believe that universities should have the ability to shape their student bodies to better reflect the diversity of society. The author argues against the notion that America is already a colorblind society and emphasizes the benefits of affirmative action programs in creating a more inclusive educational environment. Overall, the author sees the Supreme Court's decision as a positive reaffirmation of the constitutionality of using race-conscious approaches in admissions processes."	0.0010725	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	0

The author expresses frustration over the controversy surrounding the geographic diversity in awarding licenses to grow medical marijuana in Maryland. As a person with multiple sclerosis who could benefit from access to medical marijuana, the author emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the availability of the drug to those in need over economic or affirmative action considerations.

2	The discussion of affirmative action is relevant in the context of examining Gorsuch's potential impact on progressive causes and the Supreme Court's future decisions.	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is a significant issue that should be explored during Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings.	"The text discusses the upcoming confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. The author suggests that senators should focus on engaging Gorsuch in discussions about his views on the Constitution, the role of precedent, and how the court should adapt to changing circumstances. Gorsuch is described as an ""originalist"" who interprets the Constitution based on its original meaning. The author emphasizes the importance of exploring Gorsuch's approach to interpreting the Constitution and his views on precedent, as these factors could shape the court's decisions for many years.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that Democrats have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, including affirmative action. The author suggests that senators should question Gorsuch about his views on affirmative action and other issues, such as gay and transgender rights and reproductive rights. The author also highlights the importance of understanding Gorsuch's stance on precedent and his willingness to respect existing precedents, even if he disagrees with them. Ultimately, the author stresses the significance of examining Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and how it may influence the future direction of the Supreme Court."	0.00125	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	0
2	The discussion of biased wording in ballot initiatives related to affirmative action highlights the author's perspective on the topic.	neutral	The author emphasizes the importance of clear and unbiased wording in ballot initiatives and suggests that past instances of biased wording have influenced voter perception.	"The text discusses the importance of the wording of ballot initiatives and how it can influence voter perception. The author highlights a recent lawsuit by Republicans against California's Attorney General for the wording of a ballot initiative that aimed to repeal gas taxes. The author suggests that the wording was intentionally made confusing to weaken support for the initiative. The author also mentions past instances where attorneys general have been accused of bias in wording ballot initiatives, such as omitting ""affirmative action"" in a summary or using language that was criticized for being biased.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to suggest that the wording of ballot initiatives related to the topic has been contentious and subject to bias. The author argues for a nonpartisan third party, like the Legislative Analyst's Office, to handle the writing of ballot titles and summaries to ensure clarity and impartiality. The author believes that clear and nonpartisan language is crucial for voters to make informed decisions without being influenced by political spin."	0.000972	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	0
1	The author's perspective is relevant to discussions on affirmative action and diversity initiatives in the tech industry.	somewhat_against	The author critiques the idea of solely valuing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a focus on identity diversity.	"The author discusses the concept of diversity in the tech industry, particularly focusing on the shift towards emphasizing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity. The author critiques the idea that cognitive diversity alone can address the lack of representation of underrepresented groups in tech companies, highlighting the importance of maintaining a focus on racial and gender diversity. The author expresses concerns that the emphasis on cognitive diversity could be a way to avoid addressing the low numbers of black and Latino employees in leadership roles in tech companies. The author argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the significance of identity diversity, including factors like race and gender, in creating a truly inclusive workplace.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the potential shift towards solely valuing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity in the tech industry. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining a commitment to increasing racial and gender diversity, highlighting the need for companies to actively address the lack of representation of underrepresented communities. The author suggests that focusing on cognitive diversity alone may not effectively address the disparities in representation and inclusion within tech companies."	0.001624	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	0
3	The analysis is based on the author's overall perspective on racism and systemic issues in American society, which can provide insights into their potential stance on affirmative action.	somewhat_in_favor	Based on the provided text, the author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred from their broader discussion of racism and systemic inequality in America.	"The text provided discusses the concept of denial as a defense mechanism in the context of racism and how it perpetuates systemic racism in America. The author, Ibram X. Kendi, argues that denial of racism is deeply ingrained in American society and that even those who oppose overtly racist actions or individuals may still contribute to systemic racism through denial and avoidance of confronting their own biases. Kendi highlights historical examples of racism by past presidents to illustrate the long-standing denial of racism in America. The author also criticizes the denial of racism by both conservatives and white liberals, emphasizing the need for acknowledging and addressing racism rather than deflecting or denying it.

In terms of affirmative action, the author does not explicitly discuss it in this text. However, based on the overall perspective presented, it can be inferred that Kendi likely supports affirmative action as a means to address systemic racism and promote equality. Affirmative action is a policy aimed at increasing representation of historically marginalized groups in areas such as education and employment, which aligns with Kendi's call for acknowledging and confronting racism in American society."	0.0014324999999999997	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	0
1	The author's discussion on affirmative action is a part of a broader analysis of cultural and political dynamics related to progressive strategies and conservative responses.	somewhat_against	The author is critical of the progressive approach to deeming certain ideas socially unacceptable and using elite cultural power to silence dissenting voices.	"The author begins by discussing their initial perspective on gun control, believing that supporters of moderate gun restrictions were popular but legislatively weak. They suggest that to pass gun control measures, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue and appeal to Republicans. However, they observe that the push for gun restrictions has instead polarized the issue further. The author acknowledges that progressives may be onto something by focusing on cultural crusades rather than legislation to achieve victories. They note that conservatives have self-marginalized by aligning with President Trump, while progressives are becoming more aggressive in silencing dissenting opinions.

The author expresses concern that certain ideas, such as opposition to affirmative action, are now considered socially unacceptable and could lead to the stigmatization of those who hold them. They argue that progressives are aiming to delegitimize their foes and win the culture war by making conservative viewpoints socially unacceptable. The author warns that using elite cultural power to silence dissenting voices may lead to a political backlash.

Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical of the progressive approach of deeming certain ideas beyond the pale and socially unacceptable. They caution that winning by elite cultural intimidation could lead to illiberalism and a political backlash."	0.0012135	affirmative action	txt/2009409469.xml.txt	0

"The author discusses the issue of affirmative action in the context of New York City's elite high schools, particularly focusing on Stuyvesant High School. The author criticizes Mayor Bill de Blasio's efforts to change the admissions system at these schools to increase the representation of black and Hispanic students, arguing that this would unfairly disadvantage Asian American students who have worked hard and earned their spots through academic merit.

This perspective implies that the author sees affirmative action as a potentially contentious issue that may not be the most advantageous for Democrats to emphasize during the midterm elections."	0.001025	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	0

"The author of the text discusses the history and evolution of college admissions practices, particularly focusing on affirmative action. They argue that prestigious colleges and universities have historically used various criteria beyond grades and test scores, such as legacy status, athletic prowess, donations, and geographic diversity, to admit students.

1	The text discusses Chemerinsky's perspective on how justices' ideologies impact their decisions, specifically in cases involving affirmative action.	somewhat_against	The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, argues that justices are not neutral arbiters like umpires but are influenced by their ideologies and views in interpreting the law. He emphasizes the role of personal beliefs and experiences in shaping justices' decisions.	"The text discusses how Supreme Court nominees, specifically Brett Kavanaugh, often liken themselves to umpires, claiming to be neutral and impartial arbiters who do not let personal or policy preferences influence their decisions. However, the author, Erwin Chemerinsky, argues that justices are not like umpires at all. Justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law and their decisions are influenced by their ideologies and views. The Constitution's broad and open-ended language requires justices to give meaning to ambiguous words written over 200 years ago, leading to differing interpretations based on justices' ideologies. Chemerinsky emphasizes that a justice's own ideology and life experiences inevitably affect how they balance the government's interest against individual rights in constitutional cases.

Regarding affirmative action, Chemerinsky notes that in cases involving affirmative action in college admissions, the central question is whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. He points out that determining whether something is a ""compelling"" or an ""important"" or a ""legitimate"" government interest requires a value choice and cannot be answered solely by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. This suggests that Chemerinsky believes that affirmative action cases involve complex value judgments that go beyond a strict interpretation of the Constitution.

In conclusion, Chemerinsky criticizes Kavanaugh for presenting a misleading sense of constitutional law by likening justices to umpires, highlighting the significant role of ideology and interpretation in Supreme Court decisions."	0.0012490000000000001	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	0

In Malaysia, affirmative action policies were implemented to help the Malay population catch up with the wealthier ethnic Chinese. However, over time, these policies have been criticized for benefiting the well-off within the Malay group and exacerbating ethnic tensions.

"The text discusses the settlement of a lawsuit brought by a white teacher, Sharon Taxman, who was dismissed in 1989 in order to preserve a black teacher's job in Piscataway, New Jersey. The settlement was made possible by a coalition of civil rights groups agreeing to pay a significant portion of the judgment awarded to Taxman. The author highlights that supporters of affirmative action were concerned that the Supreme Court, scheduled to hear the case, might rule against race-based layoff decisions and potentially impact affirmative action plans in all workplaces. The author suggests that avoiding a Supreme Court ruling in this case was a wise decision, as the Piscataway case had unique circumstances with two teachers of equal seniority and qualifications, where the decision was based on maintaining racial diversity rather than discrimination. The author notes that the Piscataway case was not the ideal scenario for a broader legal debate on the consideration of race in employment decisions, and that the Supreme Court may eventually address this issue in the future.

The author's perspective on affirmative action in this text is nuanced. They acknowledge the importance of maintaining racial diversity but criticize the school district's approach as clumsy.

The Administration's brief acknowledges that the school board violated the civil rights of the white teacher but argues for a compromise that allows for some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring to further compelling public goals beyond remedying past discrimination.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, emphasizing the importance of considering race in certain situations to achieve compelling public goals like diversity in public institutions. The author argues against an absolutist color-blind view, highlighting the necessity of race-conscious efforts to prevent discrimination and promote diversity, especially in public employment and judicial appointments.

"The author of the letter to the editor, Timothy R. Cahn, critiques an Op-Ed titled ""Myths About Minorities"" by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence. Cahn argues that the most compelling reason to support affirmative action is not to address overt discrimination, as Matsuda and Lawrence suggest, but to rectify an admissions process that results in university classes that do not reflect the diversity of society. He contends that if racial groups are equally qualified for university admission, then the lack of proportional racial representation in universities is due to non-merit-based factors, justifying the need for affirmative action.

Cahn's perspective on affirmative action suggests that he believes it is necessary to ensure that university admissions are more reflective of the racial diversity present in society, even if individual qualifications are equal across racial groups. He emphasizes the importance of correcting systemic inequalities in the admissions process to achieve a more equitable representation of different racial groups in universities."	0.000654	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	0

"The author, Evan Edwards, responds to a column by Frank Rich discussing Tanya Melich's departure from the Republican Party. Edwards argues that the Republican Party in New York City, particularly in Manhattan, tends to be liberal to ultra-liberal, contrary to Melich's portrayal. He highlights instances where the Republican Party has been inclusive, such as allowing AIDS activist Mary Fisher to speak at a convention and appointing women to significant positions. Edwards believes that the Republican Party is for moderates to conservatives and that being against affirmative action or welfare does not make the party anti-women. He suggests that Melich is better suited as a Democrat and criticizes her contributions to a specific Democratic candidate, Ruth Messinger.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be against it, as he believes that being against affirmative action does not make the Republican Party anti-women. Edwards emphasizes the importance of the party sticking to its core beliefs and suggests that the big-tent idea should not lead the party away from its fundamental principles."	0.0007665	affirmative action	txt/2238130344.xml.txt	0

"The text discusses the author's exploration of the ""aloha spirit"" in Hawaii as a potential lesson for addressing race relations. The author shares insights from Dr. Kristin Pauker's research on how racial attitudes differ between Hawaii and the mainland United States. Dr. Pauker's studies suggest that Hawaii's diverse and mixed-race population leads to a more nuanced understanding of race, where individuals do not attribute inherent qualities to race. The text delves into the historical and sociological factors that have shaped Hawaii's unique approach to race, such as the legacy of labor organizing and the concept of ""aloha spirit.""

The third letter discusses President Reagan's appointment of Justice Scalia based on his Italian heritage and touches on the irony of Scalia's views on affirmative action.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems critical, particularly in the third letter where the writer highlights the irony of Justice Scalia's appointment by President Reagan, who is viewed as a patron saint of the GOP, despite both having negative views on affirmative action. The writer suggests that Scalia and Reagan saw affirmative action as a threat to a merit-based society, with Scalia potentially believing he deserved his position without any form of preferential treatment."	0.0007720000000000001	affirmative action	txt/230632738.xml.txt	0

"The author, Mr. Lynch, provides a critical perspective on affirmative action, particularly focusing on its impact on white men.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the leadership of liberal groups like the NAACP, suggesting that they have become out of touch with the black community by focusing on social engineering schemes like racial quotas and set-asides. The author argues that the civil rights leadership's emphasis on racial preferences does not address the real problems facing many blacks, particularly those in the underclass. The author advocates for a focus on empowerment issues that resonate with mainstream blacks, suggesting that conservatives should concentrate on specific issues where common cause exists with this demographic.

Overall, the author believes that the key to bridging the gap between blacks and whites lies in empowering those who have been denied opportunities, rather than relying on divisive racial spoils systems.

The author also highlights the importance of increasing investment capital for black-owned businesses, as well as proposing initiatives to encourage pension funds and the brokerage industry to invest in black businesses.

"The text discusses the issue of how much information the Supreme Court owes the public regarding Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health, particularly after it was revealed that he has thyroid cancer and underwent a tracheotomy.

He argues that the politicization of the judiciary, where politicians and litigants seek judges who align with their views, poses a threat to judicial independence. Rosen criticizes the trend of personal attacks on judges from both liberals and conservatives, emphasizing the importance of judges following the law diligently and avoiding the spotlight.

Rosen's perspective on affirmative action is that the Rehnquist court, which he mentions has reflected the views of a narrow majority of the American people in controversial cases involving affirmative action, gay rights, and access to early-term abortions. He argues that despite the political attacks on judges as activists, they often align with the constitutional views of national majorities. Rosen suggests that interest groups on the extreme left and right use the courts to achieve results they cannot win through the ballot box, leading to the personalization and politicization of the judiciary."	0.001484	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	0

However, Gates also points out that new forms of disconnectedness have emerged within the black community, particularly between the middle class and the underclass. He emphasizes the importance of addressing both structural and behavioral aspects of poverty, suggesting that African Americans themselves need to take action to bridge the digital divide and reconnect socially and culturally.

Lopez criticizes the misreading of Brown by some, including on the Supreme Court, who equate all race-conscious government action with racism. He emphasizes that Brown and Hernandez both responded to group mistreatment but that Hernandez explicitly addressed systematic oppression beyond just formal racial distinctions. Lopez calls for a reevaluation of how the Constitution addresses racial subordination and advocates for recognizing Hernandez as central to a robust 14th Amendment law aimed at ending racial subordination.

In summary, Lopez's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Supreme Court's current approach, which he believes equates all race-conscious government action with racism and hinders efforts to address systematic discrimination and subordination.

The author uses the example of Donald Trump's popularity among Republicans despite making controversial statements as a demonstration of this phenomenon. The author argues that politics has shifted from primarily economic debates to moral issues such as affirmative action, immigration, and healthcare, which are more polarizing and less amenable to compromise.

Trump's success is attributed to his ability to define himself and challenge the political establishment, which resonates with his supporters' desire for moral superiority and empowerment.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the author suggests that issues like affirmative action are part of the moral debates that fuel the politics of self-esteem.

Levy, advocates for a form of affirmative action that includes a 'poverty preference' in college admissions to address the inequalities faced by high-achieving low-income students.	"The author, Harold O. Levy, who is the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, discusses the inequalities in college admissions for low-income students compared to their wealthier peers. He highlights the disparities in access to selective colleges, pointing out that while poor students who do attend elite schools perform just as well as their wealthy peers, the admissions process itself is skewed in favor of the wealthy. Levy argues that legacy preferences, athletic preferences, early admissions programs, and lack of access to resources like test prep and college counseling put smart, low-income students at a disadvantage. He suggests that a form of affirmative action for low-income students is needed to level the playing field in college admissions, without reducing the role of standardized tests. Levy emphasizes the importance of providing equal opportunities for all students based on merit, rather than financial background.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it should be extended to include a ""poverty preference"" in admissions to elite colleges and universities to address the barriers faced by high-achieving low-income students. Levy advocates for recognizing the achievements of low-income students who have excelled despite facing obstacles, and he believes that giving more credit to these students in the admissions process would help create a fairer system that rewards true merit rather than financial privilege."	0.001192	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	1

The authors suggest that efforts should be made to increase political pluralism in academia, potentially through affirmative action to address the imbalance. They argue that diversity in academia should extend to including conservative voices, not just historically marginalized groups. The authors propose reforms such as allowing conservative speakers on campuses, questioning hiring biases towards like-minded colleagues, and offering visiting appointments in conservative thought.

The author's perspective on affirmative action in this context is that it should not be a consideration when it comes to the distribution of medical marijuana licenses. The author believes that the focus should be on ensuring timely access to medical marijuana for those who require it for medical reasons, rather than getting caught up in issues of diversity or affirmative action."	0.0005895	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	1

The author acknowledges the Democrats' concerns about Gorsuch's confirmation affecting progressive causes like gay and transgender rights, affirmative action, and reproductive rights. Gorsuch is described as an ""originalist"" like Scalia, interpreting the Constitution based on its original meaning. The author raises questions about how Gorsuch's originalist approach could impact modern issues not foreseen by the Constitution's framers, such as cellphone tracking and evolving interpretations of equal protection. The author also highlights the importance of Gorsuch's views on precedent and the court's ability to adapt to future societal changes beyond traditional hot-button issues.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that Democrats have concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect affirmative action and other progressive causes.

The author highlights a recent lawsuit against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra by Republicans who claim that the title given to their initiative on gas taxes was intentionally vague to weaken its support. The author suggests that using a nonpartisan third party, like the Legislative Analyst's Office, to write these titles and summaries could help ensure impartiality and clarity in the language used.

In terms of affirmative action, the author mentions a past example where former Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for not including the words ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209. This indicates a perspective that the choice of words in ballot initiatives, including the omission or inclusion of certain terms, can be politically motivated and potentially impact voter perception and support for the measures. The author advocates for nonpartisan oversight in crafting these titles and summaries to avoid such biases."	0.0010435	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	1
1	The author's perspective is relevant to discussions on affirmative action and diversity efforts in the tech industry, highlighting the importance of not diluting diversity initiatives by solely focusing on cognitive diversity.	somewhat_against	The author, Bärí A. Williams, is critical of the shift towards emphasizing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity in the tech industry. She argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the importance of identity diversity, including race and gender, in creating truly inclusive environments.	"The author, Bärí A. Williams, discusses the concept of diversity, particularly in the tech industry, focusing on the shift towards emphasizing cognitive diversity over racial and gender diversity. Williams criticizes the idea that cognitive diversity alone can address the lack of representation of underrepresented groups in tech companies. She highlights concerns that this shift in focus may serve as a way to avoid the necessary work of increasing racial and gender diversity within the industry. Williams argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the importance of identity diversity, including race and gender, in creating truly inclusive environments. She emphasizes the need for companies to prioritize hiring individuals from underrepresented communities who can bring valuable perspectives and contributions to the tech industry.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the potential dilution of diversity efforts by focusing solely on cognitive diversity. Williams believes that the historical shift in the discourse around affirmative action, particularly after the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, has led to a redefinition of diversity that may neglect the significance of addressing racial and gender disparities. She advocates for a holistic approach to diversity that includes identity diversity as a crucial component in creating inclusive workplaces."	0.0017445	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	1

The author emphasizes the historical context of racism in America, pointing out the racist behaviors and statements of past presidents to challenge the notion that racism is exceptional or abnormal. Additionally, the author criticizes both conservatives and white liberals for their denials of racism and their use of certain phrases to evade admissions of racism. The author argues that denial is fueled by the stigma associated with being labeled a racist and suggests that acknowledging and confessing to racist behaviors is essential in combating racism. The author advocates for an antiracist approach that embraces confession and challenges the denial of racism in society.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text. However, based on the overall theme of challenging denial and confronting racism, it can be inferred that the author likely supports affirmative action as a means to address systemic inequalities and promote racial equity. Affirmative action policies are typically viewed as a way to counteract discrimination and provide opportunities to historically marginalized groups."	0.001473	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	1
1	The discussion on affirmative action is a part of the broader analysis of cultural trends and the potential consequences of winning cultural battles through coercion.	somewhat_against	The author expresses concerns about the social unacceptability of opposing affirmative action and warns against winning through elite cultural intimidation.	"The author begins by discussing their initial perspective on the issue of gun control, believing that depolarizing the debate and appealing to Republicans could lead to legislative success. However, they observe that the push for gun restrictions has instead become highly polarized, with extreme rhetoric and little success in passing new laws. The author acknowledges that progressives may be onto something by focusing on aggressive cultural crusades rather than legislation, aiming to delegitimize their opponents and reshape societal norms.

The author points out that conservatives have marginalized themselves by aligning with figures like Donald Trump, while progressives have become more adept at silencing dissenting opinions. They argue that certain ideas, including opposition to affirmative action, are now socially unacceptable. The author warns that if progressives succeed in ostracizing conservatives from mainstream society, they could fundamentally alter the culture war and win on a broad range of issues beyond gun control.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to suggest that opposition to it has become a socially unacceptable idea, part of a broader trend where certain viewpoints are deemed morally illegitimate. They caution progressives about the potential consequences of winning through elite cultural intimidation, as it could lead to a backlash and further polarization in society.

"The author discusses the issue of affirmative action in the context of New York City's elite high schools, particularly focusing on Stuyvesant High School. The author criticizes Mayor Bill de Blasio's efforts to change the admissions system at these schools to increase the representation of black and Hispanic students, arguing that this would be unfair to the predominantly Asian American students who have earned their spots through hard work and studying for the entrance exam. The author highlights the sacrifices made by many Asian immigrant families to ensure their children's success and questions why these students should be deprived of their earned opportunities based on race or ethnicity.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, particularly in this specific case where Asian American students, many of whom come from poor backgrounds, are being affected. The author argues that the current admissions system, based solely on an entrance exam, is fair and that efforts to change it in the name of diversity would undermine the achievements of students who have worked hard to succeed."	0.001064	affirmative action	txt/2053215813.xml.txt	1

It also highlights the need for Democrats to prioritize issues where they have a decisive advantage in public opinion, such as healthcare and corruption, during the midterm campaign.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that while it is an important social issue that inspires liberal passion, it may not be the most strategic issue for Democrats to focus on during the midterm campaign. The author suggests that Democrats should prioritize issues where they have a clear advantage in public opinion, like healthcare and corruption, to appeal to a broader base of voters. The text implies that while issues like affirmative action are significant, they may not be the most effective for Democrats to emphasize during the upcoming elections."	0.001148	affirmative action	txt/2065768718.xml.txt	1

The author emphasizes the role of value judgments in constitutional issues and the complexity of balancing government interests and individual rights.	"The author criticizes the comparison made by Supreme Court nominees, particularly Brett Kavanaugh, between justices and umpires. The author argues that justices have significant discretion in interpreting the law and that their decisions are influenced by their ideologies and views. The author highlights that constitutional issues often require value judgments that cannot be solely determined by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding. The author emphasizes that justices play a crucial role in balancing government interests against individual rights, citing examples such as affirmative action and same-sex marriage laws. The author concludes by asserting that Kavanaugh's comparison to an umpire presents a misleading view of constitutional law.

The author's perspective on affirmative action suggests that the issue involves determining whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest, which requires a value judgment rather than a straightforward interpretation of the Constitution. This indicates that the author views affirmative action as a complex constitutional issue that goes beyond textual analysis."	0.00104	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	1

"The author of the letter to the editor is Timothy R. Cahn from San Francisco, writing in response to an Op-Ed titled ""Myths About Minorities"" by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence. Cahn disagrees with Matsuda and Lawrence's argument for retaining affirmative action. He asserts that if racial groups are equally qualified for university admission regardless of race, the lack of proportional racial representation in universities is due to non-merit-based factors. Cahn believes that affirmative action is necessary not to address overt discrimination, as Matsuda and Lawrence argue, but to correct the admissions process that leads to university classes not reflecting society's racial diversity.

Cahn's perspective on affirmative action seems to focus on the idea of correcting systemic issues in the admissions process rather than addressing past discrimination. He suggests that affirmative action is needed to ensure that universities reflect the racial diversity of society, even if individuals from different racial groups are equally qualified."	0.0006695	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	1

Rosen's perspective on affirmative action is that the judiciary, particularly the Rehnquist court, has actually supported the views of a narrow majority of the American people in controversial cases involving affirmative action, gay rights, and access to early-term abortions. He argues that despite the political attacks on judges as tyrannical activists, in most cases, judges reflect the constitutional views of national majorities. Rosen suggests that interest groups on the extreme left and right often try to use the courts to achieve results they cannot win through the normal political process, but this can alienate the broader public. Ultimately, Rosen emphasizes the importance of judges following the law diligently, resisting political pressures, and avoiding the spotlight to maintain judicial independence and public trust in the judiciary."	0.001549	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	1

Pollster Steve Kinney predicts that as politicians address education reform and other issues such as health care and infrastructure, voters may become complacent and shift their focus to new concerns. Kinney's theory is based on the idea that once a problem is perceived as being addressed, voters move on to other issues. He uses examples like illegal immigration and affirmative action, which lost political significance after the passage of Propositions 187 and 209. Kinney emphasizes the importance of analyzing the intensity of voter concern rather than just the ranking of issues.

The author ultimately supports the idea of providing equal opportunities to all who work hard and seek success.

The author's perspective on affirmative action evolves throughout the text. Initially feeling defensive of the program, the author comes to realize that while his son may not need affirmative action, there are still students facing significant social disadvantages who could benefit from it.

The author criticizes the SAT for its bias towards students from privileged backgrounds and argues that it does not accurately measure students' potential for success in college. The author advocates for the elimination of the SAT as a criterion for college admissions and suggests that admissions procedures should focus on qualities like motivation, effort, critical thinking, and intercultural awareness instead.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that the use of the SAT as a criteria for admissions is a proxy for maintaining racial and economic advantages of privileged groups, particularly rich whites. The author believes that affirmative action is necessary to address racial inequalities in educational opportunities and that admissions procedures should be reformed to be more inclusive and fair to all students, regardless of their background."	0.00107	affirmative action	txt/421591042.xml.txt	1

"The author of the text criticizes the complexity and potential political motivations behind the 57 multiethnic categories introduced in the 2000 census. They argue that this convoluted data undermines efforts to address past racial injustices, monitor affirmative action programs, and maintain ethnic community voting blocs. The author questions the necessity of these new categories, particularly in light of the challenges and confusion they create for individuals trying to identify their ethnic backgrounds. They suggest that focusing on socio-economic factors rather than race could provide more relevant and less divisive information. Ultimately, the author advocates for sticking to traditional race categories until the government clarifies the purpose and benefits of the new multiethnic classifications.

The author's perspective on affirmative action appears to be critical of how the new multiethnic categories complicate the monitoring and implementation of such programs.

Locke also discusses the implications of dropping the ban on affirmative action, suggesting that the new criteria may protect the university system from discrimination charges but will disadvantage academically qualified students. He questions the motives behind the new admissions criteria, attributing them to an egalitarian desire to undermine the concept of academic competence. Locke's perspective is critical of the shift towards subjective admissions criteria and emphasizes the importance of academic merit in the admissions process.	0.0009240000000000001	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	1

The author criticizes liberals for supporting affirmative action yet attacking Thomas, a supposed beneficiary of such policies, as unqualified. The author argues that this inconsistency reveals the hypocrisy of Thomas' critics and highlights the negative effects of racial preferences, suggesting that such policies can lead to questioning the achievements of individuals who are black, even by liberals. The author supports Thomas' opposition to racial preferences based on his personal conscience and concern for their impact on black Americans. The text concludes by calling for Thomas to be treated as an individual rather than a scapegoat for political agendas.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of its potential negative consequences, such as undermining the achievements of black individuals and perpetuating stereotypes of them as beneficiaries of preferential treatment rather than merit. The author supports Justice Thomas' stance against affirmative action, emphasizing individuality and merit-based evaluation over race-based preferences."	0.0011480000000000001	affirmative action	txt/422176235.xml.txt	1

Legal analysts noted that Sotomayor maintained a moderate profile and demonstrated an open mind on legal issues. Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, criticized the confirmation process for not providing a clear picture of Sotomayor's future as a justice. He also highlighted her conservative-leaning statements during the hearings. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, expressed frustration with Sotomayor's responses, feeling she avoided direct answers. Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, criticized the Republican senators for focusing on identity politics and affirmative action instead of thoroughly vetting Sotomayor. She praised Sotomayor for appearing judicious and moderate during the hearings.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as presented through Kimberly West-Faulcon's comments, suggests that the Republican senators used the confirmation hearings as an opportunity to push their ideology and legal philosophy, particularly regarding affirmative action.

"The author, David Whitman, discusses the aftermath of the Miami riot and challenges the perspective that racial discrimination alone is the root cause of race riots. He argues that while discrimination played a role in igniting the riot, the deeper roots of racial violence in Miami were related to class conflict. Whitman highlights the economic disparities within the black community, with a growing black middle class but a persistent black lower class facing limited opportunities for advancement. He criticizes affirmative action as a strategy that benefits a small portion of the black community while leaving the most disadvantaged segments untouched. Whitman advocates for programs directed specifically at addressing the needs of poor blacks, such as ensuring full employment and reforming the welfare system. He warns that without these efforts, racial tensions and unrest in cities are likely to persist.

Whitman's perspective on affirmative action is critical, as he believes that it creates divisive backlash among different ethnic groups and working-class whites, and widens the class gap within the black community. He argues that affirmative action primarily benefits a small portion of the black community who can attend college and compete for desirable jobs, while neglecting the most disadvantaged segments. Whitman suggests that a more effective approach would be to focus on programs that directly address the needs of poor blacks, such as ensuring full employment and improving teen-age employment opportunities."	0.001249	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	1

In terms of affirmative action, the author is critical of the Reagan Administration's choices for these positions, particularly due to their perceived lack of support for equal employment opportunities.

Texas, which was decided on May 3, 1954, two weeks before the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Lopez argues that Hernandez was an important case because it established a standard for when the Constitution should bar group-based discrimination, specifically focusing on group subordination rather than just racial distinctions. He contrasts Hernandez with Brown, suggesting that Brown did not explicitly address systematic oppression as the basis for ruling against school segregation, leaving room for misinterpretation that now influences conservative views on antidiscrimination law, including on the Supreme Court.

Lopez criticizes the current Supreme Court for equating all race-conscious government actions, including affirmative action, with racism, and for upholding situations where racism operates implicitly. He argues that the court's approach undermines the original intent of Brown to address systematic discrimination and oppression. Lopez calls for a reevaluation of the interpretation of Brown and a recognition of the importance of Hernandez in shaping a robust 14th Amendment law focused on ending racial subordination.

In summary, the author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the Supreme Court's current stance, which he believes conflates affirmative action with racism and fails to address systemic discrimination and oppression effectively.

The author argues that while the Voting Rights Act was designed to end the suppression of African American voting and is supported by the 15th Amendment granting Congress the power to enforce voting rights, there have been unintended consequences of the act. These consequences include increased political polarization along racial lines due to the creation of majority-black districts that elect liberal African American Democrats and majority-white districts that choose conservative white Republicans. The author suggests that while the Voting Rights Act was crucial in securing voting rights for minorities, it may now hinder the rise of minority candidates to higher political positions. The text also mentions concerns about the act's relevance in the 21st century and the potential for the Supreme Court to rule against it, sparking a debate on how to protect voting rights while restoring political centrism.

The author's perspective on affirmative action in the context of the Voting Rights Act is critical, highlighting the unintended consequences and challenges posed by the act's current implementation. The author suggests that while affirmative action measures like creating opportunity districts for minority candidates have been beneficial in some ways, they have also led to political polarization and limitations on the advancement of minority candidates to higher political offices.

The editorial board argues in favor of the university's affirmative-action program, highlighting the need for a diverse student body and the limitations of the state's top 10 percent program in achieving this diversity. They suggest that the Supreme Court should provide clearer guidance on what constitutes constitutionally acceptable affirmative-action policies for public universities.

They argue that the university's affirmative-action program is a carefully designed effort to complement existing race-neutral policies and promote diversity among students.

The author, Judith Shulevitz, presents a critical perspective on the current guidelines and practices enforced by the Department of Education, arguing that they undermine due process and the rights of the accused. Shulevitz suggests that universities should push back against these guidelines, seek clarification on definitions of sexual misconduct, and emphasize a ""reasonable-person test"" for determining guilt or innocence. Additionally, she advocates for universities to collaborate more with local law enforcement agencies to handle sexual violence cases more effectively. Ultimately, the author calls for a reevaluation of current campus procedures and a shift towards a more balanced and fair approach in addressing sexual assault allegations."	0.0011719999999999999	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	2

They also argue against the idea that universities are obligated to take a stand on every issue of social importance and express concerns about the moral perils of divestment, including hypocrisy, donor intent, and the risk of diverting attention from more pressing educational issues.

Regarding affirmative action, the author emphasizes that issues like affirmative action, which directly impact educational processes and outcomes, have a different claim on academia compared to other political conflicts.

2	The discussion on hate speech policy and free expression on campuses is used to infer the author's potential stance on affirmative action.	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is inferred based on their emphasis on free expression and challenges in defining impermissible speech.	"The text discusses the challenges faced by the regents of the University of California in developing a hate-speech policy on campuses, particularly in response to recent anti-Semitic incidents. The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, explains the difficulty in balancing freedom of speech with preventing hate speech, as defining hate speech is complex and has faced constitutional challenges in the past. The author discusses the need for a policy that focuses on reaffirming free expression while clearly defining what types of speech and conduct are impermissible.

Erwin Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text. However, based on his emphasis on the importance of free expression and the challenges of defining hate speech, it can be inferred that he likely views affirmative action as a topic that could also fall within the complexities of defining permissible speech on campus. The text suggests that advocating for affirmative action could potentially be viewed as violating a hate-speech policy if it stigmatizes racial minorities by assuming they need preferential treatment. Chemerinsky's approach seems to prioritize protecting free expression while also acknowledging the need for clear boundaries on impermissible speech and conduct."	0.0010705	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	2
1	The analysis focuses on how the author views affirmative action within the broader context of political discourse and the motivations behind individuals' engagement in political issues.	somewhat_against	The author's perspective on affirmative action is analyzed based on their discussion of how political engagement is increasingly driven by a desire for moral superiority and self-esteem.	"The text discusses the concept of the ""politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals become politically engaged to boost their own self-esteem. The author explains how Donald Trump's rise to popularity can be partially attributed to this phenomenon, as he challenges prevailing norms and makes his supporters feel morally superior. The author argues that politics has shifted from primarily economic debates to moral issues like affirmative action, immigration, and healthcare, which are more polarizing and less amenable to compromise. Trump's ability to define himself and challenge the establishment resonates with his supporters, providing them with ""psychic benefits"" that enhance their self-esteem.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to align with the broader theme of the text, which is that political engagement is increasingly driven by a desire for moral superiority and self-esteem. The author suggests that issues like affirmative action serve as platforms for individuals to feel morally superior to their opponents, rather than as topics for genuine policy debate. This perspective implies a critique of how political discourse has become more about personal validation and less about finding practical solutions to complex societal issues like affirmative action."	0.0010885	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	2

Levy advocates for the inclusion of a 'poverty preference' in college admissions to address the disparities faced by low-income students and level the playing field for all academically qualified individuals.	"Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, discusses the challenges faced by high-achieving low-income students in gaining access to elite colleges and universities. He highlights the disparity in college admissions, where students from wealthy families have significant advantages over their less privileged counterparts. Levy argues that the current system favors the wealthy through legacy preferences, athletic preferences, early-admissions programs, and access to resources like test preparation. He suggests that a form of affirmative action should be implemented to level the playing field for academically qualified low-income students. Levy emphasizes the importance of providing equal opportunities for all students based on merit, rather than financial background.

Levy's perspective on affirmative action is that it should be extended to include a ""poverty preference"" in college admissions to address the disadvantages faced by high-achieving low-income students. He argues that this would help to counteract the existing privileges enjoyed by wealthy students and provide a fair chance for all academically qualified individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

They argue that increasing political diversity through affirmative action would enhance the legitimacy of universities and promote a more balanced curriculum.

Overall, the authors advocate for a more inclusive academic environment that values diversity of thought, even if it means implementing measures like affirmative action to address the underrepresentation of conservatives in academia."	0.0011385	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	2

Cahn, wrote a letter to the editor in response to an Op-Ed piece titled ""Myths About Minorities"" by Mari J. Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence. Cahn argues that while Matsuda and Lawrence did not make the strongest case for retaining affirmative action, he believes that affirmative action is still necessary. He suggests that if racial groups are not inherently more or less qualified for university admission based on race, then the lack of proportional racial representation in universities is due to non-merit-based factors. Cahn asserts that affirmative action is needed to correct the admissions process that has led to university classes that do not reflect the racial diversity of society.

Cahn's perspective on affirmative action is that it is essential for addressing the systemic issues within the admissions process that have resulted in underrepresentation of certain racial groups in universities.

"The text discusses Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's evolving perspective on affirmative action and her interactions with Justice Thurgood Marshall. Initially, Justice O'Connor opposed affirmative action and had a states'-rights orientation that made her skeptical of federal court review of state criminal justice issues. However, by the time of her retirement in 2006, she had shifted her stance and wrote the majority opinion that preserved affirmative action in university admissions. The author suggests that while Justice Marshall's influence may not be the sole reason for O'Connor's change, it likely played a role.

The author argues that these policies have disproportionately affected Asian-American students, who are often high achievers. The author criticizes the shift towards prioritizing ""equity"" over merit-based achievement and suggests that this approach undermines the success of Asian-American students and their families who value education. The author also highlights instances where school officials have justified their actions by claiming to prioritize individual recognition over academic achievements, which has led to negative consequences for high-achieving students.

"The author argues that the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) should support a capital gains tax cut, despite the initial counterintuitive nature of the suggestion. The author believes that a capital gains tax cut would stimulate economic growth, create jobs for the black community, and potentially eliminate the need for affirmative action in the long run. The author emphasizes that increasing investment capital for black-owned businesses is crucial, especially as welfare reform puts pressure on disadvantaged blacks. Additionally, the author suggests specific initiatives to encourage investment in black-owned businesses, such as issuing interpretations to pension funds and getting the brokerage industry to raise money for black companies. The author believes that a capital gains tax cut would greatly benefit black-controlled businesses and increase job opportunities within the black community. Furthermore, the author highlights the potential benefits for the CBC in supporting a capital gains tax cut, including forming alliances with the Republican Congress and enhancing the value of the CBC vote.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that policies promoting economic growth and increasing investment in black-owned businesses could eventually render affirmative action unnecessary.

"The author discusses Jennifer Gratz's lawsuit against the University of Michigan challenging its affirmative action policies. The author presents both sides of the argument, highlighting that if Gratz wins, it could lead to dismantling affirmative action programs at the university. On the other hand, if Gratz loses, opponents of affirmative action may have the chance to challenge race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court. The author suggests that Gratz seems to have a strong case as the university's admissions guidelines appear to treat minority applicants differently from white applicants. However, the author also points out that it is complex to determine if any individual student was rejected solely based on race, as admissions decisions are influenced by various factors. The author questions whether the Bakke case, which allowed race to be a factor in admissions but not the sole determinant, is still applicable today. Despite recent court decisions narrowing the acceptable uses of affirmative action, the author argues that allowing universities to consider race in admissions for fostering diversity may still be a constitutional approach.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be nuanced. They acknowledge the complexities and potential issues with how affirmative action policies are implemented but also argue for the constitutional validity of considering race in admissions decisions in certain circumstances to promote diversity.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be cautious but leaning towards supporting it. The author mentions that opponents of the MAI treaty raise concerns about how it could affect affirmative action, among other things.

Bush, have embraced elite values and policies, such as tolerance, gun control, and affirmative action, over traditional populist grievances. The author suggests that the success of the U.S. economy and Clinton's strategic political moves, including using polling data to shape policies, have contributed to the rise of elite-driven politics.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it is part of the broader trend towards elite-driven politics. The text mentions Clinton's careful positioning on affirmative action, advocating to ""mend it, don't end it,"" as an example of how polling and strategic political moves have helped shape policies that accommodate populist sentiments in a surgical way. The author implies that affirmative action, along with other issues like gun control and tax cuts, has been co-opted by elites to align with prevailing majority support, rather than being driven solely by populist grievances."	0.0016449999999999998	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	2

In terms of affirmative action, the author raises questions about how the candidates' choices for their administration would reflect diversity and inclusion. The author suggests that voters, especially African Americans and other voters of color, may be concerned about the impact of the Democratic Leadership Council's influence on issues like affirmative action and urban policies in a potential Gore administration. The author advocates for early disclosure of key appointees to address these concerns and to allow voters to assess the qualifications and competence of those who would shape important policies.

Overall, the author's perspective leans towards the importance of transparency, diversity, and the need for candidates to reveal their potential governing teams to the public before Election Day."	0.001239	affirmative action	txt/408649107.xml.txt	2

Lieberman, the first Jew nominated by a major party for president or vice president, presented himself as a classic American success story, emphasizing values like faith, family, hard work, and equal opportunity. The author notes that Lieberman's reputation for integrity and bipartisanship could create tensions within the Democratic Party, as some of his past independent stances differ from traditional Democratic views. Lieberman highlighted areas of agreement with Al Gore, such as health care and the environment, while downplaying differences on issues like affirmative action, tort reform, and school vouchers. The author questions whether the Gore-Lieberman ticket can offer new ideas without straying too far from the Democratic Party's core constituents, emphasizing the importance of preserving openness and innovation within the party.

The author's perspective on affirmative action in this context appears to be somewhat critical of Lieberman's approach. While Lieberman has previously questioned affirmative action, he endorsed it in his speech to align with Democratic Party values. The author highlights this as an example of Lieberman downplaying his past independent stances to align with the party's traditional positions. The text suggests that the Democratic Party should maintain openness to new ideas and be willing to challenge traditional positions, including on issues like affirmative action."	0.001142	affirmative action	txt/408654746.xml.txt	2

"The author of the text expresses concerns about John Ashcroft's nomination as attorney general, focusing on the potential impact of his personal and ideological views on law enforcement policy. The author argues that merely stating Ashcroft would ""enforce the law fairly"" is insufficient, as the attorney general also shapes law enforcement policy decisions. The author highlights Ashcroft's conservative advocacy record and suggests that his strong ideological positions could influence his role as attorney general. The author questions whether it is unfair to oppose Ashcroft based on fears that his personal and religious views may impact his decisions in office, referencing Ashcroft's past opposition to Bill Lann Lee's appointment due to his beliefs on affirmative action. The text ultimately calls for a deeper examination of how Ashcroft's views could shape law enforcement policies and decisions at the Department of Justice."	0.0009295	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	2

"The author of the text discusses the concept of ""advice and consent"" in the context of judicial nominations and how conservatives interpret these terms when it comes to the Senate's role in approving judges. The author criticizes conservatives for selectively applying their preferred judicial ideology, such as ""strict construction"" and ""original intent,"" and argues that these concepts are not always clear-cut or universally applicable. The author suggests that senators should be allowed to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and reject them based on their views on specific legal issues. The author also highlights instances where conservative groups have opposed nominees based on ideological differences, particularly regarding issues like affirmative action. Overall, the author challenges the notion that conservative judicial philosophy is beyond legitimate dispute and argues for a more nuanced approach to evaluating judicial nominees based on their legal reasoning and views on specific issues."	0.00112	affirmative action	txt/409108213.xml.txt	2

The author compares Bush's approach to that of Bill Clinton, highlighting their similar strategies in handling core issues and appealing to swing voters.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is one of the core issues that Bush has addressed to satisfy his base while also making strategic moves to appeal to swing voters. The author sees Bush's support for ending racial profiling in law enforcement as a calculated political move that pleases swing voters, weakens his opposition, and does not alienate his core supporters. This analysis suggests that the author views affirmative action as a negotiable issue that can be leveraged for political advantage."	0.0010364999999999999	affirmative action	txt/409129544.xml.txt	2

2	The discussion on affirmative action is relevant to the broader context of the Supreme Court's decision-making process and the impact of individual justices' views on significant rulings.	neutral	The author's perspective is that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's pivotal role in upholding affirmative action in college admissions is highlighted, emphasizing the influence of her ideological shift on the court's decision.	"The text discusses the issue of how much information the Supreme Court owes the public about Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health, following the disclosure of his cancer diagnosis. The court's tradition of discretion regarding justices' personal lives is highlighted, with some arguing that in today's context of the court's significant role in policymaking, more transparency is needed. The debate includes perspectives from experts like Supreme Court historian David J. Garrow, who emphasizes the public's right to know, and others who defend the court's more secretive approach due to constitutional differences between the judiciary and other branches of government.

Regarding affirmative action, the author's perspective is that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor played a pivotal role in the Supreme Court's decision to uphold affirmative action in college admissions in 2003. Political science research shows that O'Connor's ideological shift towards the left influenced the court's decision, as she became the court's ""median voter.""

"The text discusses the increasing threats and attacks against judges in the United States, particularly in light of high-profile cases like Terri Schiavo's and the politicization of the judiciary. The author, Jeffrey Rosen, argues that judges are now being targeted personally and politically, with both liberals and conservatives attacking them when decisions do not align with their views. Rosen highlights the dangers this poses to judicial independence and the rule of law. He criticizes Congress and the president for attempting to influence judicial decisions and emphasizes the importance of judges adhering to the law and avoiding the spotlight.

Regarding affirmative action, Rosen mentions that the Rehnquist Court has supported the views of a narrow majority of Americans in controversial cases, including affirmative action.

The author examines specific examples such as Social Security, Medicaid, the Terri Schiavo case, and the debate over judicial nominees to illustrate how interest groups mobilize support, shape public opinion, and impact policy outcomes.

Regarding affirmative action, the author does not explicitly discuss this topic in the text provided. However, the author's perspective on interest groups influencing policy decisions could apply to the debate over affirmative action as well.

2	The discussion on shifting voter priorities in California and the historical context of Propositions 187 and 209 provide a basis for understanding the author's perspective on affirmative action.	neutral	The author, as represented by pollster Steve Kinney, views affirmative action as an issue that loses political traction once voters perceive progress in addressing it.	"The text discusses the shifting priorities of California voters in terms of political issues. The author, through the perspective of pollster Steve Kinney, suggests that education, which has been a key issue for politicians, is likely to lose its top spot as a voter concern. Kinney predicts that as politicians address education reform and voters see progress, they will shift their focus to new issues like health care and infrastructure. Kinney uses past examples such as illegal immigration and affirmative action, which lost political traction after certain propositions were passed, to support his theory.

Regarding affirmative action, the author's perspective, as conveyed through Kinney, is that once a problem is perceived to be talked about enough and being solved, voters move on to new issues. The passing of Propositions 187 and 209, which dealt with illegal immigration and affirmative action respectively, led to a decline in the intensity of these issues as voter concerns. This perspective suggests that voter interest in affirmative action wanes once they believe the problem is being addressed."	0.0011095	affirmative action	txt/421507153.xml.txt	2

"The author of the text is reflecting on his son's high school essay that criticizes affirmative action. The author, who had previously advocated for affirmative action, is taken aback by his son's stance. The author's son, Miguel, argues that affirmative action should be abolished because he believes it is unfair and amounts to reverse racism. However, the author acknowledges that Miguel, who comes from a privileged background, does not personally need affirmative action to succeed. The author then discusses the importance of affirmative action in helping less privileged students who face social disadvantages, such as those from poor areas with inadequate resources. The author suggests that affirmative action should be targeted towards students who truly need assistance and highlights the disparities in educational opportunities based on race and affluence. The author ultimately supports the idea of providing equal opportunity to all who work hard and pursue success, regardless of their background.

The author's perspective on affirmative action evolves throughout the text. Initially, the author is surprised and conflicted by his son's rejection of affirmative action.

"The author, Halford H. Fairchild, discusses the issues surrounding the use of the SAT as a criterion for college admissions. Fairchild argues that the SAT is a flawed test that perpetuates racial and economic inequalities, as it does not accurately measure students' potential for success in higher education. Fairchild criticizes the SAT for its biases and advocates for a more holistic approach to evaluating students based on motivation, effort, and critical thinking skills rather than standardized test scores. Fairchild also challenges the use of standardized tests like the SAT II, MCAT, LSAT, and GRE, suggesting that they too are biased and do not effectively assess merit in the context of diverse educational backgrounds. Fairchild ultimately calls for a shift away from standardized testing in admissions processes and towards creating more opportunities for students in higher education.

Fairchild's perspective on affirmative action is critical of those who support the use of the SAT as a way to maintain racial and economic advantages for privileged groups, suggesting that standardized tests like the SAT perpetuate these inequalities. Fairchild advocates for admissions procedures that eschew biased criteria and instead focus on qualities like critical thinking and intercultural awareness.

"The author expresses skepticism and criticism towards the newly recognized 57 multiethnic categories in the 2000 census.

"The text discusses the new admissions policies announced by the Board of Regents of the University of California, which will consider factors beyond academic qualifications like grades and test scores, such as athletic ability, artistic talent, and overcoming poverty. The author, Edwin A. Locke, criticizes these changes, arguing that they aim to eliminate fairness and objectivity from the admissions process. Locke believes that the new guidelines will lead to a subjective admissions process where hidden agendas can influence decisions. He also expresses concerns that the new policies may lead to politicization and the reintroduction of race as a factor in admissions, despite claims to the contrary.

Locke strongly opposes affirmative action and argues that the new admissions criteria are driven by egalitarian motives, aiming to undermine the concept of academic competence and create a subjective admissions process that could disadvantage high-achieving students. He criticizes the regents for de-emphasizing academics and suggests that the changes will harm both students and universities in the long run. Locke's perspective is clear in his belief that academic qualifications should be the primary criteria for college admissions, and he is critical of any deviation from this principle."	0.0010365	affirmative action	txt/421647247.xml.txt	2

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as reflected in the text, seems critical of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's stance. Rehnquist is portrayed as having a conservative and states' rights-oriented approach, which has led to the narrowing or reversal of protections for various groups, including criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities, and students. The author also criticizes Rehnquist for his opposition to abortion rights, his support for upholding laws against consensual sex among homosexuals, and his role in the controversial Bush vs. Gore ruling that essentially installed George W. Bush as president. The text suggests that Rehnquist's successor could potentially shift the court further to the right, impacting important precedents like Roe v.

"The text discusses Senator Charles Schumer's perspective on the political landscape in the United States, particularly focusing on the perceived shift in ideologies between the Democratic and Republican parties.

The author suggests that Democrats have become the party of reactionary liberalism, while Republicans are championing progress and change.

In terms of affirmative action, the author seems critical of the Democratic stance on the issue. The author questions whether racism, sexism, and ""class-ism"" still explain every societal ill and suggests that perhaps affirmative action has been in place for long enough.

The author highlights the hypocrisy of those who support affirmative action yet criticize Thomas for allegedly benefiting from it. The author argues that Thomas opposes racial preferences due to his personal beliefs and concerns about their impact on black Americans. The text also delves into the broader implications of affirmative action and its effects on individuals' achievements and perceptions. The author ultimately calls for a more respectful treatment of Clarence Thomas and emphasizes the importance of recognizing his individuality and humanity, rather than using him as a target for political agendas.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the double standards and hypocrisy surrounding the issue.

2	The analysis focuses on the author's stance on affirmative action in the context of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court.	neutral	The author's perspective is inferred from Kimberly West-Faulcon's comments on the Republican senators' emphasis on identity politics and affirmative action during the hearings.	"The text discusses the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination. Republicans focused on national security, fiscal responsibility, gun rights, and judicial activism, while legal analysts noted Sotomayor's moderate stance on legal issues. Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar, criticized Sotomayor for following a misleading script and downplaying the role of judges in making law. Ilya Shapiro from the Cato Institute expressed frustration with Sotomayor's responses during the hearings. Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor, highlighted the Republican senators' emphasis on identity politics and affirmative action during the hearings. She praised Sotomayor for appearing judicious and moderate.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as reflected through Kimberly West-Faulcon's comments, suggests that the Republican senators used the confirmation hearings as an opportunity to push their ideology and legal philosophy, particularly focusing on divisive issues like affirmative action. West-Faulcon sees this as a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge on the topic rather than focusing on vetting Sotomayor. However, she believes that Sotomayor successfully presented herself as a moderate and accomplished the goal of appearing judicious during the hearings."	0.0010825	affirmative action	txt/422316037.xml.txt	2

"The text discusses the aftermath of the Miami riot and challenges the idea that racial discrimination alone is the cause of such violence. The author argues that while discrimination played a role, the roots of racial violence in Miami are deeper and primarily stem from class conflict. The author highlights the widening class gap within urban black communities, where the black middle class has grown, but the lower class has seen little improvement. The text criticizes affirmative action as a solution, suggesting that it creates division among ethnic groups and working-class whites, and widens the class gap within the black community. The author calls for programs directed specifically towards disadvantaged blacks to address issues such as unemployment and reforming the welfare system.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, suggesting that it does not effectively address the needs of the most disadvantaged segments of the black community. The author argues that affirmative action programs primarily benefit a small portion of the community who can attend college and compete for desirable jobs, while leaving the most vulnerable groups essentially untouched. The author advocates for programs that directly target the needs of poor blacks, such as ensuring full employment and increasing employment opportunities for teenagers."	0.001143	affirmative action	txt/423943644.xml.txt	2

"The text discusses the author's perspective on the Reagan Administration's appointments to key positions, specifically Ronald Zumbrun to head the Legal Services Corporation and William Bell to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The author criticizes these appointments as being detrimental to the respective agencies due to the appointees' lack of relevant experience and potential conflicts of interest. Zumbrun is portrayed as being opposed to the legal services program he would be in charge of, while Bell is described as lacking accomplishments in civil rights and management. The author suggests that these appointments are part of a pattern where the Reagan Administration is undermining programs and agencies from within by appointing individuals who may not have the best interests of these programs at heart.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, as they highlight Zumbrun's preference for helping corporations that oppose affirmative action. This suggests that the author views affirmative action as a necessary and beneficial policy that should be supported, especially in the context of employment practices. The author implies that appointing individuals who are not supportive of affirmative action to key positions related to civil rights and equal employment opportunity is damaging and goes against the principles of promoting equality in the workforce."	0.0008879999999999999	affirmative action	txt/424224130.xml.txt	2

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as indicated by the mention of affirmative action consultants in the list of recipients, is not explicitly stated in the text.

The text also delves into the perspective of White House chief of staff John Sununu, who is portrayed as sharp but inexperienced, and discusses the administration's approach to issues like executive authority and the line-item veto.

In terms of affirmative action, the author suggests that the Bush Administration's approach involves seeking ways to enhance rescission, a process of getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations without requiring affirmative legislative action. The author seems critical of this approach, questioning whether it will be successful and implying that it may lead to a substantial giveback of executive authority. The author's perspective on affirmative action in this context appears skeptical of the administration's methods and the potential implications of their actions."	0.0011389999999999998	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	2

The authors are accused of echoing the views of William Shockley, who advocated for sterilization of individuals with low IQs. The text also mentions that the authors call for the abolition of affirmative action and welfare, and predict a future where the intelligent elite dominate society while the less intelligent are marginalized.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as presented in the text, is critical. They suggest that the arguments put forth in ""The Bell Curve"" against affirmative action are not based on original or sound scientific evidence but are instead part of a larger narrative that aims to perpetuate racial divisions and promote conservative policies.

He believes that diversity enhances education, prepares leaders from all segments of society, and promotes social and economic mobility.

Despite the passage of Proposition 209 in California, which prohibits preferences based on race or ethnicity, Carnesale notes that affirmative action is still used in admissions decisions to consider qualities beyond academic scores, such as unique backgrounds, talents, and personal achievements.

The author also questions the implications of policies on issues like affirmative action and criticism of Israel, pointing out the fine line between protected speech and impermissible conduct.

Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that it may potentially be at odds with policies aimed at preventing hate speech. He raises the question of whether advocating for affirmative action could be considered a violation of policies against hate speech, as it may be perceived as stigmatizing racial minorities. The author suggests that any policy should focus on reaffirming the importance of free expression while clearly defining what types of speech and conduct are not constitutionally protected, such as threats or harassment. Chemerinsky also stresses the importance of universities speaking out against inflammatory speech that targets members of the university community, aligning with the educational mission and principles of the 1st Amendment."	0.0011305	affirmative action	txt/1716194235.xml.txt	3
2	The author's perspective on affirmative action is crucial in understanding how moral framing impacts political discourse and governance.	neutral	The author discusses how political issues, including affirmative action, are framed in moral terms, leading to polarization and hindering compromise.	"The author discusses the concept of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals become politically engaged because it makes them feel better about themselves. The author uses Donald Trump's rise in popularity as an example, noting that his defiance of prevailing norms and moral superiority over the political establishment and mainstream media resonates with his supporters, providing them with ""psychic benefits."" The author suggests that in today's political landscape, issues framed in moral terms, such as affirmative action, have become more politically combustible than economic matters. The author points out that the pursuit of moral superiority in political debates can hinder compromise and governance, as individuals on both the right and left seek affirmation of their values rather than practical solutions.

In terms of the author's perspective on affirmative action, it is implied that the issue falls within the realm of moral questions that are difficult to compromise on due to the strong emotions and sense of moral superiority they evoke in supporters on both sides. The author seems to view affirmative action as part of the broader trend where political issues are increasingly framed in moral terms, leading to polarization and making governance more challenging."	0.00107	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	3

3	The text provides insights into the author's perspective on affirmative action and its potential application in college admissions to support low-income students.	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Harold O. Levy, advocates for a 'poverty preference' in college admissions to address disparities faced by low-income students, similar to affirmative action.	"In the provided text, Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, discusses the disparity in college admissions for low-income students compared to their wealthier counterparts. He highlights the findings of a study by the Cooke Foundation, which reveals that only a small percentage of students at selective colleges come from low-income families, despite the academic success of these students once admitted. Levy argues that the current system favors wealthy students through legacy preferences, athletic preferences, test preparation advantages, and early-admissions programs, which put low-income students at a significant disadvantage.

Levy advocates for a ""poverty preference"" in college admissions, akin to affirmative action, to level the playing field for academically qualified low-income students. He suggests that while standardized tests should not be reduced in importance, admissions officers should give more credit to low-income students for their achievements despite lacking the advantages of enrichment courses, internships, and travel experiences. Levy emphasizes the importance of providing fair opportunities for all students based on merit, rather than on their parents' financial status.

Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, as he believes that implementing a poverty preference in admissions could help address the existing disparities and provide equal opportunities for academically qualified low-income students to attend selective colleges and universities."	0.0011755	affirmative action	txt/1761271674.xml.txt	3
3	The text is highly relevant to the topic of affirmative action as it discusses expanding its scope beyond historical discrimination to include increasing diversity of viewpoints.	somewhat_in_favor	The author is advocating for new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia by addressing the underrepresentation of conservatives in the social sciences.	"The text discusses the underrepresentation of conservatives in academia, particularly in the social sciences, and argues for new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia. The authors present data showing the low percentage of professors who self-identify as Republicans in the social sciences compared to other fields. They argue that this imbalance can lead to a lack of diverse viewpoints and hinder civil discourse and the pursuit of truth in academic research. The authors suggest that universities should make efforts to welcome conservative voices, such as by not barring conservative speakers, questioning hiring biases, and offering visiting appointments in conservative thought.

The authors' perspective on affirmative action is that it should not only focus on historical discrimination but also on increasing diversity of viewpoints in academia. They argue that universities, which often prioritize diversity, should extend this principle to include conservatives who are underrepresented in certain academic fields. The authors believe that by making academia more inclusive of conservative perspectives, universities can foster a more balanced and intellectually diverse environment that benefits both students and the pursuit of knowledge."	0.0011845	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	3

"The text discusses the recent Supreme Court ruling in favor of the University of Texas at Austin's admissions process, which considers race as one of many factors in achieving a diverse student body. The author supports the decision, emphasizing the importance of universities being able to use a race-conscious approach to promote diversity and the educational benefits that come with it. The author highlights Justice Kennedy's opinion that universities have the right to define characteristics like student body diversity that are central to their mission. The text also mentions opposing views, such as Justice Thomas and Justice Alito's criticisms of affirmative action and the belief that race-conscious policies are unnecessary. Ultimately, the author agrees with Justice Kennedy that universities should have the autonomy to shape their student bodies in a way that reflects the diversity of society.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive, arguing that race-conscious admissions policies are essential for achieving a diverse and inclusive educational environment. They emphasize the benefits of diversity and the importance of universities being able to consider race as one of many factors in their admissions processes. The author also acknowledges and rebuts opposing views that argue against affirmative action, asserting that ending race-conscious policies would not lead to a colorblind society.

	The author's frustration with the controversy surrounding geographic diversity in awarding licenses to grow medical marijuana in Maryland highlights their perspective on the issue.	None	The author emphasizes the importance of prioritizing access to medical marijuana for those in need over other factors like economic development or affirmative action programs.	"The author expresses frustration over the controversy surrounding the geographic diversity in the awarding of licenses to grow medical marijuana in Maryland. The author, who has multiple sclerosis and would benefit from access to medical marijuana, emphasizes that the focus should be on making the drug available to those who need it, rather than on economic development initiatives or affirmative action programs. The author believes that politicians and regulators have lost sight of the medical program's purpose and should prioritize providing access to medical marijuana quickly.

In terms of affirmative action, the author's perspective is clear that medical marijuana should not be treated as an affirmative action program. The author argues that the primary focus should be on the medical aspect of the program and ensuring timely access for those in need, rather than on considerations such as geographic diversity or other non-medical factors."	0.0005794999999999999	affirmative action	txt/1823531226.xml.txt	3

"The text discusses the upcoming confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court. The author suggests that Senators should focus on engaging Gorsuch in a serious discussion about his views on the Constitution, precedent, and how the court should adapt to changing circumstances. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding Gorsuch's approach to interpreting the Constitution as an ""originalist"" and how that might impact various issues such as affirmative action, reproductive rights, and same-sex marriage.

The author seems to have a critical perspective on Gorsuch's originalist approach, particularly in relation to how it may affect progressive causes like affirmative action. The author raises questions about whether Gorsuch's originalism could hinder the court's ability to adapt to evolving societal norms and technologies. While acknowledging Gorsuch's qualifications, the author advocates for a thorough examination of Gorsuch's judicial philosophy to ensure that the Supreme Court can effectively address future challenges."	0.0011680000000000002	affirmative action	txt/1878508466.xml.txt	3

They provide examples where the wording of ballot initiatives was contested due to potential political implications.	"The text discusses the importance of the language used in ballot initiatives and how it can impact voter perception. The author highlights a recent case where Republicans sued California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, over the wording of a ballot initiative to repeal gas taxes. The author suggests that the language used in ballot titles and summaries should be clear, concise, and non-partisan to avoid political bias and manipulation. The author suggests that the responsibility of writing these titles and summaries should be given to a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office, to ensure fairness and neutrality.

Regarding affirmative action, the author mentions a historical example where former Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for not including the words ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209. This example implies that the choice of words in ballot initiatives, including the omission or inclusion of certain terms, can have political implications. The author suggests that a nonpartisan approach to writing ballot titles and summaries could help mitigate such issues and ensure transparency in the electoral process."	0.0010485	affirmative action	txt/1919844871.xml.txt	3

In the text provided, Bärí A. Williams discusses the concept of diversity, specifically focusing on the perspective of cognitive diversity in the tech industry. Williams criticizes the idea that cognitive diversity, which emphasizes differences in thoughts and ideas, could replace the need for racial and gender diversity in the workplace. She highlights the danger of diluting the definition of diversity to include only individual white men with unique viewpoints, rather than addressing the lack of representation of underrepresented groups such as women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals. Williams expresses concern that emphasizing cognitive diversity may serve as a distraction from the pressing need to increase racial and gender diversity in tech companies, which continue to have low percentages of black, Latino, and female employees in leadership roles. She argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the importance of identity diversity, which includes factors like race, gender, and socioeconomic background. Williams emphasizes the necessity of actively recruiting and hiring individuals from underrepresented communities to ensure true diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.	0.0016355	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	3

Kendi argues that denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism, and he criticizes both conservatives and white liberals for their denials of racism and attacks on identity politics. The author emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and confessing to racism rather than denying it.

Kendi's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in this text. However, based on his overall argument about the denial of racism and the need for acknowledgment, it can be inferred that he likely supports affirmative action as a means to address systemic racism and promote equality. Affirmative action is a policy aimed at increasing the representation of historically marginalized groups in areas such as education and employment, which aligns with Kendi's call for recognizing and confronting racism in American society."	0.0014320000000000001	affirmative action	txt/1987023512.xml.txt	3

"The author begins by discussing their initial belief that to pass gun restrictions, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue and separate some Republicans from the NRA's position. However, they observe that the push for gun restrictions has actually polarized the issue further. Despite recent legislative failures in implementing gun restrictions, the author acknowledges that progressives may be onto something bigger - the potential to win important victories through an aggressive cultural crusade rather than legislation. The author notes that conservatives have self-marginalized by aligning with Donald Trump, while progressives are becoming more effective at silencing dissenting opinions. The author warns that if progressives continue to use elite cultural intimidation to silence opposing views, it could lead to a political backlash. The author concludes by cautioning progressives to be careful in how they achieve their victories, as illiberalism can breed further illiberalism and potentially spark a significant political backlash.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical, as they mention opposition to it as one of the formerly popular ideas that can now end someone's career. The author seems to suggest that progressives are working towards delegitimizing opposing views, including those against affirmative action, by using cultural power to stigmatize and silence dissent.

"The text discusses the debate surrounding affirmative action in the context of New York City's elite high schools, particularly Stuyvesant High School. The author, Richard Cohen, expresses skepticism towards Mayor Bill de Blasio's efforts to increase diversity at these schools by changing the admissions process, which currently relies solely on an entrance exam. Cohen argues that the system, based on meritocracy, has helped propel many poor students, including Asian Americans, into the middle class and beyond. He highlights the hard work and sacrifices made by Asian American families to succeed in these schools and questions why they should be penalized based on their race or ethnicity. Cohen's perspective is critical of affirmative action in this specific case, arguing that it unfairly disadvantages hardworking students who have earned their place in these elite schools.

Cohen's perspective on affirmative action in this context is clear: he believes that merit-based admissions should be the sole criteria for entry into elite schools like Stuyvesant High School. He argues that the system has worked to uplift many poor students, particularly Asian Americans, and that changing it in the name of diversity would be unjust and counterproductive.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that while it is an issue that inspires liberal passion, it may not be the most strategic focus during a midterm campaign. The author suggests that Democrats should prioritize issues where they have a decisive advantage in public opinion, such as health insurance, taxation, corporate power, and the Trump administration's corruption. The author warns against Democrats assuming that the country is more left-leaning than it actually is, citing public opinion on issues like abortion.

He emphasizes the complexity of constitutional rights and the need for value judgments in issues like affirmative action.	"The author, Erwin Chemerinsky, criticizes the comparison made by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh between judges and umpires. Chemerinsky argues that justices are not like umpires because they have significant discretion in interpreting the law and their decisions are influenced by their ideologies and views. He points out that constitutional rights are not absolute and often involve balancing the government's interests against individual rights. Chemerinsky also highlights that questions regarding compelling government interests, such as affirmative action and same-sex marriage laws, require value judgments and cannot be solely determined by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding.

Chemerinsky's perspective on affirmative action suggests that he believes it is a complex issue that involves weighing the government's interest in promoting diversity against other considerations. He implies that determining whether diversity in college admissions is a compelling government interest requires a value choice rather than a clear answer from the Constitution. Overall, Chemerinsky emphasizes the importance of recognizing the influence of justices' ideologies and experiences in their decision-making process and criticizes Kavanaugh for presenting a misleading view of constitutional law during his confirmation hearings."	0.0011265	affirmative action	txt/2099964529.xml.txt	3

The first letter criticizes Mrs. Clinton for appearing to support policies contrary to human rights standards, despite her previous advocacy for human rights. The second letter praises Clinton for recognizing the impact of mass migration on right-wing movements in Europe, attributing the rise of the right to the left's failure to acknowledge cultural differences. The third letter argues that the immigration issue did not cause the rise of the far right but rather provided an excuse for promoting certain beliefs. The author suggests that addressing root causes like conflicts in the Middle East and climate change is crucial for managing immigration.

The authors' perspectives on affirmative action vary. The first letter seems critical of Mrs. Clinton's stance on immigration, suggesting that her support of affirmative actions towards refugees in Germany may not align with her current political motives. The second letter acknowledges the impact of mass migration on right-wing movements and seems to suggest that affirmative actions towards refugees have inadvertently fueled right-wing political power.

Riley also challenges the effectiveness of affirmative action in the U.S., citing examples where policies intended to help minorities have not necessarily led to the desired outcomes. He questions the justification for affirmative action, suggesting that it may exacerbate racial and ethnic tensions and hinder progress for those it aims to assist.

Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action is skeptical, emphasizing the need to evaluate the actual impact and effectiveness of such policies rather than relying on assumptions about their benefits.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical, as they mention that the right-leaning crowd at the Federalist Society used to grumble about affirmative action and the New Deal.

He emphasizes the importance of the president being able to work effectively with his cabinet members, suggesting that forcing appointments of individuals with conflicting ideologies may hinder the functionality of the government's balance of power.

In terms of affirmative action, Teachout seems to support a perspective that values the alignment of cabinet members' beliefs with those of the president for effective governance. He points out that General Colin L. Powell's views on affirmative action differ from Bush's, but that this diversity of thought can still be accommodated within the cabinet as long as it does not impede the president's ability to work with his team. This suggests a pragmatic approach to diversity in viewpoints within the administration, prioritizing functional working relationships over strict ideological alignment."	0.0006925	affirmative action	txt/2233007997.xml.txt	3

The text discusses the settlement of a lawsuit in Piscataway, N.J., where a white teacher was dismissed in 1989 to preserve a black teacher's job. The settlement was made possible by civil rights groups agreeing to pay a significant portion of the judgment awarded to the white teacher. The author's perspective on affirmative action is that avoiding a Supreme Court ruling in this case was a wise decision. The author acknowledges that the Piscataway case had unique circumstances with two equally qualified teachers, one white and one black, being laid off due to budget cuts, and the district choosing to keep the black teacher to maintain racial diversity. The author suggests that while the district's goal of diversity was commendable, the approach was clumsy. The author also mentions that at some point, the Supreme Court will likely address whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits considering race in employment decisions, except as a remedy for actual discrimination, but notes that the Piscataway case was not the ideal scenario for that legal debate.	0.000764	affirmative action	txt/2236625026.xml.txt	3

The Administration's brief to the Supreme Court acknowledges that the school board violated the civil rights of the white teacher but argues for a compromise to preserve some constitutional latitude for race-based public hiring. The text highlights the importance of affirmative action in achieving compelling public goals such as diversity in police departments and educational institutions.

The author argues that affirmative action is necessary not to address overt discrimination, as Matsuda and Lawrence suggest, but to correct the admissions process that leads to university classes not reflecting the diversity of society. The author implies that affirmative action is needed to ensure that racial representation in universities is more reflective of society's demographics, even if individuals from different racial groups are equally qualified for admission.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to focus on the importance of achieving diversity in university admissions to mirror the broader societal makeup. They suggest that affirmative action is necessary to address systemic issues in the admissions process that result in underrepresentation of certain racial groups, rather than solely as a response to overt discrimination."	0.000614	affirmative action	txt/2237777942.xml.txt	3

The author notes that if Gratz wins, it could lead to the dismantling of the program, potentially causing minority enrollments to drop. On the other hand, if Gratz loses, opponents of affirmative action could have an opportunity to challenge race-conscious admissions processes before the Supreme Court, which is seen as unfriendly to affirmative action.

The author suggests that Gratz's case appears strong on the surface, as the University of Michigan's admissions guidelines seem to handle minority applications differently from white applicants, potentially violating the Supreme Court's ruling in University of California Regents v. Bakke. The author acknowledges the complexity of admissions systems and the difficulty in proving that a student was rejected solely based on race.

1	The author's perspective on affirmative action is a significant aspect of their overall critique of Bradley and Gore's approaches to campaigning and addressing racial issues.	somewhat_against	The author criticizes both Bill Bradley and Al Gore for their approaches to racial issues and identity politics, suggesting that their focus on affirmative action and racial preferences may hinder progress towards a more unified society.	"The text discusses the political landscape surrounding Bill Bradley and Al Gore, focusing on their approaches to campaigning and their perspectives on issues like race and environmental policies.

"The text discusses the shift in American politics away from populism towards a more elite-driven political landscape during the Clinton era. The author argues that both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush, as front-runners in the 2000 presidential race, are well-positioned to benefit from this shift. The text highlights how issues like gun control, foreign interventionism, and affirmative action have become more accepted and supported by the majority, signaling a move towards elite values in national politics. The author also mentions how the success of the U.S. economy and various other factors have contributed to the decline of populism in American politics.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it is one of the issues that has transitioned from being a source of populist grievance to becoming more widely accepted in the political mainstream. The author discusses Clinton's approach to affirmative action as ""mend it, don't end it,"" which reflects a more moderate stance aimed at accommodating public opinion while not completely dismantling the policy. The author suggests that polling has played a role in shaping politicians' positions on affirmative action and other issues, allowing them to navigate and address populist sentiments in a strategic manner."	0.0016285	affirmative action	txt/408523809.xml.txt	3

The author reflects on the ability of white voters to look beyond a black candidate's race, highlighting examples like the support for David Dinkins, Doug Wilder, Ed Brooke, J. C. Watts, Colin Powell, and Clarence Thomas. The author questions whether white conservatives can support black candidates based on their views rather than race, and ponders if this demonstrates a disregard for the opinions of black voters. The author ultimately suggests that there may be hope for progress in racial attitudes if conservatives can move beyond race to consider character and philosophy.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on the discussion of race and the consideration of character and philosophy over race, it can be inferred that the author may have a nuanced view on affirmative action. The author seems to be advocating for a shift towards judging individuals based on their merits and beliefs rather than solely on their race, which could imply a more individualistic approach to issues like affirmative action."	0.0010505	affirmative action	txt/408580425.xml.txt	3

"The text discusses Joseph Lieberman's speech at the Democratic National Convention where he portrayed himself as a classic American success story, emphasizing values like faith, family, hard work, and equal opportunity. Lieberman's selection as Al Gore's running mate raised some tensions due to his independent stances on issues like ethics, fundraising, and policies that differ from traditional Democratic views. Despite his past questioning of affirmative action, Lieberman endorsed it in his speech to align with Democratic principles. The text also highlights Lieberman's avoidance of controversial topics like tort reform and school vouchers, focusing instead on areas of agreement with Gore, such as health care and the environment. The text raises questions about whether the Gore-Lieberman ticket can introduce new ideas while staying within the Democratic Party's core beliefs and pleasing its key constituents. It emphasizes the importance for Democrats to maintain openness to change and innovation to remain relevant and appealing to voters.

The author's perspective on affirmative action in this text is somewhat critical of Lieberman's shift in stance.

The author expresses concern that Ashcroft's conservative views and advocacy could influence his decisions on law enforcement policies, particularly in areas like drug laws, gun control, abortion, and affirmative action. The author questions whether it is fair to oppose Ashcroft based on fears that his personal and religious beliefs might impact his role as attorney general, citing Ashcroft's past opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination due to Lee's views on affirmative action.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical of Ashcroft's opposition to Bill Lann Lee's nomination based on Lee's beliefs on affirmative action. The author questions the consistency in Ashcroft's reasoning, suggesting that if concerns about someone's beliefs affecting their ability to make balanced judgments apply to a division head, it should also apply to the attorney general. The author appears to view Ashcroft's stance on affirmative action as a factor that should be considered in assessing his suitability for the role of attorney general."	0.0011315	affirmative action	txt/409060590.xml.txt	3

The author criticizes conservatives for their selective interpretation of the Constitution, especially when it comes to scrutinizing judicial nominees based on their ideologies. The author argues that conservatives often present their preferred judicial ideology as beyond dispute, using phrases like ""judicial restraint,"" ""strict construction,"" and ""original intent"" to support their views. However, the author challenges this perspective by pointing out inconsistencies in conservative arguments, such as their stance on affirmative action and the limitations of relying solely on buzzwords for judicial decision-making.

The author believes that the Senate should have the right to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and reject them based on their views, as long as the scrutiny is fair and reasonable.

"The author discusses President Bush's rise in public opinion and attributes it to several factors, including low expectations, a charming demeanor, and a focused agenda. The author acknowledges that while Bush may not excel in verbal intelligence, he possesses political intelligence, which enables him to understand and manipulate people and situations effectively. The author contrasts verbal intelligence with political intelligence and argues that Bush's success lies in his ability to grasp the dynamics of politics, particularly the concept of triangulation, which involves satisfying the core supporters, blunting the anti-core opposition, and appealing to swing voters.

The author also compares Bush's approach to politics with that of Bill Clinton, highlighting their strategies in handling core supporters, anti-core opposition, and swing voters. The author praises both Bush and Clinton for their understanding of the importance of addressing core supporters' nonnegotiable demands while also appealing to swing voters by making strategic concessions on contentious issues.

Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action in the context of Bush's political intelligence suggests that Bush's support for ending racial profiling in law enforcement was a calculated move to weaken the anti-core opposition, please swing voters, and maintain support from his core supporters.

He argues that judges should uphold the law impartially, resist political pressures, and avoid seeking the spotlight to maintain the integrity of the judicial system.

Rosen's perspective on affirmative action is mentioned briefly in the text. He references Mark Tushnet's argument that the Rehnquist court, in cases involving controversial issues like affirmative action, gay rights, and access to early-term abortions, has actually reflected the views of a narrow majority of the American people. This suggests that, in some instances, judicial decisions align with the constitutional views of national majorities, despite accusations of judges being anti-democratic elitists. The mention of affirmative action in this context implies that judicial decisions on such contentious issues may not always be as divisive as they are portrayed, and that judges may be more in tune with public sentiment than commonly believed."	0.001532	affirmative action	txt/409790149.xml.txt	3

The author suggests that the focus should be on improving the academic preparation of black and Hispanic students in elementary and secondary schools rather than lowering standards or blaming the SAT for disparities in college admissions and retention rates.

The author's perspective on affirmative action leans towards the idea that addressing the root causes of educational disparities, such as inadequate academic preparation in earlier schooling, is more important than implementing measures like eliminating the SAT or lowering standards to increase diversity in higher education.

The study found that while the percentages of both black and white women participating in job training programs doubled over the two decades, white women were more likely to participate in managerial and professional training compared to black women. In the 1980s, participation in job training programs among black women decreased, leading to a decline in equality of access to such programs between white and black women. However, the study also highlighted that the intensity of job training experiences resulted in higher wages for women, regardless of the program's duration, education level, or work history.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that there is a need to increase the accessibility of job training programs for black working women. They suggest that businesses should invest in on-the-job training as a way to attract diverse and qualified personnel, which in turn leads to tangible rewards for employees and increased bottom-line benefits for employers.

The author believes that the convoluted data from these categories makes it difficult to monitor and legislate affirmative action and other race-based programs. They question the purpose and implications of these categories, particularly in how they impact different ethnic communities and voting blocs. The author suggests that focusing on socio-economic factors rather than race could provide more valuable information without perpetuating racial divisions.

The author challenges Abram's viewpoint by advocating for the consideration of race to address racism and the need for treating individuals differently to achieve equality.	The text discusses the perspective on affirmative action, particularly focusing on the views of Morris Abram, a nominee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The author highlights Abram's belief that affirmative action should be neutral and that any form of discrimination, whether in favor of or against any person, is morally and legally wrong. Abram opposes governmentally enforced quotas and argues that giving preference to one group today could lead to demands for special treatment from other minorities in the future, potentially leading to conflict. However, the author challenges Abram's stance by emphasizing the importance of taking race into account to address racism and the need to treat some individuals differently in order to achieve equality. The author also references President Lyndon Johnson's perspective on affirmative action, which emphasized the necessity of going beyond mere freedom and equal opportunity to address the systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups. Ultimately, the author suggests that while Abram is entitled to his viewpoint, his stance of neutrality may not fully align with the historical context and principles of affirmative action advocated by figures like Johnson.	0.001122	affirmative action	txt/424669038.xml.txt	3

"The text provides a satirical account of the Bush Administration's perceived lack of urgency and complacency in governance. The narrative involves a scenario where the President is unconscious for three and a half years, waking up in 1992 to a White House that seems to be running smoothly. The author, while interviewing White House chief of staff John Sununu, discusses the administration's approach to governance and its differences from the Reagan era. Sununu uses metaphors to explain the shift in leadership style under Bush, emphasizing a focus on conciliation over confrontation. The text also touches on potential changes in executive authority, particularly in budgeting processes, and speculates on the administration's effectiveness in achieving its goals.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as discussed in the text, relates to the potential enhancement of rescission as an alternative to the line-item veto. This approach would involve getting Congress to agree to rescind parts of appropriations without requiring affirmative legislative action, thus potentially giving back executive authority. The author seems skeptical about the success of Sununu and Darman in achieving this goal for President Bush, questioning the effectiveness of their strategy and expressing doubts about its outcome."	0.0011775	affirmative action	txt/427163446.xml.txt	3

The memo suggests focusing on divisive issues within the black community, highlighting disagreements rather than common ground. It also encourages portraying the N.A.A.C.P. as only serving the black middle class and suggests using arguments against affirmative action to undermine its effectiveness.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical, as they suggest finding individuals, including black individuals, who argue that affirmative action has negative effects on its beneficiaries.

"The text discusses Bob Dole's approach to challenging Bill Clinton during the presidential campaign, particularly focusing on his indecisiveness and wavering on various issues. The author criticizes Dole for his lack of firmness in confronting Clinton on ethical matters, suggesting that his pattern of equivocating and reversing himself raises doubts about his leadership capabilities. The author points out Dole's inconsistencies on issues such as challenging Pat Buchanan, addressing campaign staff errors, and his abrupt reversal on affirmative action and supply-side economics to align himself with Ronald Reagan. The author concludes that Dole's character failings make it difficult for him to present himself as a credible presidential alternative, as his indecisiveness and avoidance of confrontations contribute to voter skepticism about his ability to lead effectively.

3	The discussion of contrasting approaches in California and Texas, as well as the positive outcomes of the 10 percent plan in Texas, are key points that highlight the author's stance on affirmative action.	somewhat_in_favor	The author's perspective on affirmative action is analyzed based on their support for inclusive policies that promote diversity and equal opportunities in education.	"The text discusses the contrasting approaches to affirmative action in California and Texas, as seen through the perspectives of Lani Guinier. In California, a ban on considering race and ethnicity in public college admissions led to a significant drop in the admission rates of black, Hispanic, and American Indian students, raising concerns about resegregation in higher education. On the other hand, Texas implemented the 10 percent plan, which automatically admitted students in the top 10 percent of their high school class to selective public schools, without considering race. This plan led to increased diversity in admissions and improved access to education for students from various backgrounds. The author, through the lens of the Texas example, supports a more inclusive and equitable approach to college admissions, emphasizing the importance of focusing on classroom performance in high school rather than standardized test scores.

Overall, the author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be in favor of policies that promote diversity and equal opportunities in education, as demonstrated by the positive outcomes of the 10 percent plan in Texas. The author highlights the benefits of such inclusive policies in improving access to education for underrepresented groups and narrowing the achievement gap, ultimately advocating for a broader public discussion on education that values diversity and excellence simultaneously."	0.0010755	affirmative action	txt/430957877.xml.txt	3

It highlights the high level of agreement among the three most liberal justices on the court: Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, who voted together at least 93 percent of the time. The author emphasizes that their alignment is based on ideology rather than gender. The text also mentions Justice Stephen G. Breyer's rightward drift and the fractured nature of the conservative justices' voting patterns in the term.

Regarding affirmative action, the author mentions that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor had differing opinions on the issue, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case related to the University of Texas's affirmative action plan. Despite this disagreement, the author notes that these three female justices are the most liberal on the court and tend to vote together due to their ideological similarity."	0.001246	affirmative action	txt/1372854272.xml.txt	4

"The text discusses the affirmative action program at the University of Texas at Austin and the recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which upheld the university's admissions policies as constitutional. The author presents the perspective that the university's modest affirmative-action program, which complements the state policy of admitting students in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, should be allowed to continue. The text highlights the argument that the affirmative action program is necessary to further enhance diversity on campus beyond what the top 10 percent scheme achieves, especially considering ongoing racial segregation in Texas schools. The author also calls for clearer guidance from the Supreme Court on what constitutes constitutionally acceptable affirmative-action policies for public universities.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is supportive of UT Austin's program, emphasizing the need for diversity and the university's efforts to achieve it through a carefully designed affirmative-action policy. The author acknowledges the complexities and challenges surrounding affirmative action cases but argues that UT's program is a cautious and permissible way to promote diversity and consider race as one factor among many in the admissions process."	0.0009315	affirmative action	txt/1548604795.xml.txt	4
2	The discussion of due process and fairness in handling campus rape cases can provide insights into the author's potential stance on affirmative action, as both issues involve questions of justice and equity in institutional policies.	neutral	The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly discussed in the text, so we must infer their stance based on their broader concerns and values.	"The text discusses the complex issue of campus rape allegations and the challenges faced by universities in handling these cases. The author questions the effectiveness and fairness of the current system for adjudicating sexual assault cases on college campuses, particularly due to the pressure exerted by the United States government, which mandates that universities handle these cases internally. The author argues that these guidelines have led to a lack of due process for the accused, with schools being pushed to prioritize the rights of the accuser over those of the accused. The author suggests that universities should push back against these guidelines, seek clarification on definitions of sexual misconduct, and implement a ""reasonable-person test"" to determine guilt or innocence. Additionally, the author proposes that universities should collaborate more with local law enforcement agencies to address sexual violence cases more effectively.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is not explicitly addressed in the text. However, the author's focus on due process and fairness in handling campus rape cases may suggest a broader concern for justice and equity in institutional policies and procedures."	0.0012735000000000001	affirmative action	txt/1652232593.xml.txt	4

However, based on the arguments presented regarding universities engaging with social issues and the importance of focusing on educational outcomes, it can be inferred that the author may have a nuanced stance on affirmative action.	"The text discusses the rising campaigns for colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuel companies and the arguments for and against divestment. The author, William G. Bowen, expresses skepticism towards divestment as a tactic, highlighting concerns about the practical difficulties of divesting, the potential adverse effects on endowments, and the effectiveness of divestment in bringing about desired changes in corporate practices. Bowen argues against the notion that universities are obligated to take a stand on every issue of broad social importance, emphasizing the importance of maintaining focus on the educational mission of universities. He also criticizes the moral perils of divestment, including hypocrisy, honoring donor intent, and the risk of diverting attention from more pressing educational issues.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that it directly affects educational processes and outcomes, making it a more legitimate issue for academia to engage with compared to other political issues. He emphasizes the importance of universities remaining open to diverse viewpoints and avoiding prioritizing partisan or political stances. Bowen cautions against institutions getting involved in extramural battles that could detract from addressing fundamental educational and social issues.

The author highlights the difficulty in balancing freedom of speech with preventing racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic speech. They mention the complexities of defining hate speech and the potential conflicts with the 1st Amendment, citing past unconstitutional rulings on vague speech rules.

Regarding affirmative action, the author raises questions about how advocating for affirmative action could potentially violate hate speech policies by stigmatizing racial minorities. They also discuss the challenges of defining criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic and the importance of distinguishing between protected speech and impermissible conduct.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be cautious, emphasizing the need for clear policies that reaffirm free expression while also addressing conduct that is not constitutionally protected. They suggest focusing on defining what types of speech and conduct cross the line without inhibiting protected speech.

2	The discussion of moral issues like affirmative action as part of the broader political landscape sheds light on the challenges faced in navigating divisive topics.	neutral	The author presents a nuanced analysis of the concept of 'the politics of self-esteem' and its impact on contemporary politics, using Donald Trump's rise as a case study.	"The author discusses the concept of ""the politics of self-esteem,"" where individuals become politically engaged to boost their own self-esteem. The author uses Donald Trump's rise in popularity despite controversial statements as an example of this phenomenon. The author suggests that politics has shifted from primarily economic issues to moral issues, such as affirmative action, abortion, and immigration, which are more divisive and less amenable to compromise. Supporters of these moral crusades often feel morally superior to their opponents and seek validation for their beliefs. Trump's appeal lies in his defiance of traditional norms and his ability to make his supporters feel morally superior by association. The author highlights the challenges faced by the political establishment and mainstream media in responding to Trump's rhetoric, as criticism often backfires and boosts his popularity further. The author concludes by noting that the politics of self-esteem hinder political accommodation and compromise, making governance more difficult.

Regarding affirmative action, the author does not explicitly state a clear stance on the issue. However, the discussion of moral issues like affirmative action being politically combustible suggests that the author recognizes the divisiveness of the topic. The author implies that issues like affirmative action contribute to the polarization in politics, where individuals on both sides feel morally justified in their positions, making compromise challenging."	0.0011545	affirmative action	txt/1750369183.xml.txt	4

"In the text provided by the user, Harold O. Levy, the executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, discusses the inequality in college admissions for low-income students compared to their wealthier peers. He highlights that despite being academically successful, students from low-income families face significant barriers in accessing selective colleges. Levy argues that there is a form of affirmative action for the wealthy in college admissions, with legacy preferences, athletic preferences, test preparation advantages, and early admissions programs favoring affluent students. He calls for a ""poverty preference"" in admissions to elite colleges to level the playing field for high-achieving low-income students. Levy emphasizes the importance of providing opportunities based on merit rather than financial background and advocates for recognizing the achievements of low-income students who have succeeded despite facing significant obstacles.

Levy's perspective on affirmative action is focused on addressing the systemic disadvantages faced by low-income students in the college admissions process. He believes that a poverty preference in admissions is necessary to ensure that academically qualified students from underprivileged backgrounds have equal opportunities to attend selective colleges.

"The text discusses the underrepresentation of conservatives in academia, particularly in the social sciences, and argues for new affirmative efforts to increase political pluralism in academia. The authors present data showing the significant lack of conservative professors in social science fields compared to other disciplines and highlight the challenges and biases conservatives face in academic settings. They suggest that universities should strive for diversity of thought, including conservative perspectives, to enhance civil discourse and the pursuit of truth within academia.

The authors' perspective on affirmative action is nuanced. They argue that while universities have traditionally emphasized diversity over remedial justice in their affirmative action policies, increasing political diversity, including conservative viewpoints, could benefit academia by fostering a broader range of research interests and interpretations. They advocate for modest reforms to make conservatives feel more welcome in academia, such as ending the exclusion of conservative speakers, questioning hiring biases towards like-minded colleagues, and offering visiting appointments in conservative thought. Ultimately, the authors stress the importance of practicing what universities preach about diversity and inclusivity to deepen their public legitimacy in a polarized age."	0.0012055	affirmative action	txt/1774364135.xml.txt	4

The author supports the decision, emphasizing the importance of universities being able to achieve diversity through a race-conscious approach. The text highlights the court's recognition of the benefits of a racially and ethnically diverse student body and the need for universities to have the autonomy to shape their student bodies accordingly. Justice Kennedy's opinion is particularly noted for upholding the university's holistic approach to admissions and rejecting arguments against affirmative action. The author criticizes dissenting justices who reject race considerations in admissions and argues against the idea of a colorblind society, supporting the notion that affirmative action is necessary to reflect the diversity of today's America.	0.0009255	affirmative action	txt/1799136984.xml.txt	4

The author highlights a recent lawsuit by Republicans against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, claiming that the title given to their initiative on repealing gas taxes was intentionally vague and misleading. The author suggests that using a nonpartisan third party, such as the Legislative Analyst's Office, to write ballot titles and summaries could help ensure neutrality and clarity in the language used.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the way former Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican, was sued for not including the words ""affirmative action"" in the summary of Proposition 209, which ended state affirmative action programs in 1996.

The author critiques the idea that cognitive diversity alone can address the lack of racial and gender diversity in tech companies, highlighting concerns that it may serve as a distraction from efforts to increase representation of marginalized communities. The author argues that while cognitive diversity is important, it should not overshadow the importance of identity diversity, such as race and gender, in creating inclusive workplaces.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of the potential dilution of the concept of diversity in tech companies, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a focus on increasing racial and gender diversity rather than solely prioritizing cognitive diversity. The author highlights the historical context of affirmative action and warns against using cognitive diversity as a way to avoid addressing the lack of diversity in terms of race and gender."	0.001568	affirmative action	txt/1951409635.xml.txt	4

1	The author's perspective on affirmative action is central to their broader discussion on the cultural and political polarization surrounding issues like gun control.	somewhat_against	The author critiques the progressive approach of delegitimizing opposition to affirmative action and using elite cultural intimidation to silence dissenting opinions.	"The author begins by discussing their initial belief that in order to pass moderate gun restrictions, it would be necessary to depolarize the issue and separate some Republicans from the NRA's position. However, they observe that the push for gun restrictions has instead polarized the issue further, with the involvement of left-wing groups and extreme rhetoric. Despite this, the author acknowledges that progressives may be onto something bigger, as they seem to be delegitimizing their foes through an aggressive cultural crusade rather than legislation. The author notes that conservatives have self-marginalized by aligning with Donald Trump, while progressives are becoming more effective at silencing dissenting opinions, including opposition to affirmative action. The author warns that if progressives continue to use elite cultural intimidation to win victories, it could lead to a backlash. They caution that conservatives may mount a political backlash if they are exiled from respectable society.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be critical of the progressive approach of deeming opposition to affirmative action as morally illegitimate and socially unacceptable. They caution against using elite power to silence dissenting opinions, as it could lead to illiberalism and a potential backlash.

"The author discusses the issue of affirmative action in the context of New York City's elite high schools, particularly Stuyvesant High School. The author criticizes Mayor Bill de Blasio's efforts to change the admissions system at these schools to increase the representation of black and Hispanic students, arguing that this would unfairly disadvantage Asian American students who have gained admission based on merit through a standardized entrance exam. The author highlights the hard work and sacrifices made by many Asian American families to secure admission to these prestigious schools and questions the fairness of prioritizing race or ethnicity over merit in admissions decisions. The author expresses a strong opposition to affirmative action in this case, arguing that it would undermine the American dream and the principles of fairness and meritocracy.

In summary, the author's perspective on affirmative action in this context is that it is unjust and detrimental to hardworking Asian American students who have earned their places in elite schools through merit-based admissions processes.

The second writer, Lorna Salzman, praises Clinton for acknowledging the impact of uncontrolled mass migration on right-wing political movements in Europe. Salzman criticizes the left for not recognizing cultural differences between Europeans and refugees, which she believes contributed to the rise of the right wing. The third writer, Jane Carey, argues that the immigration issue did not cause the rise of the far right but rather provided them with a platform to push their beliefs. Carey suggests that addressing the root causes of immigration, such as conflicts in the Middle East and climate change, is essential.

The authors' perspectives on affirmative action vary. While Bertrand seems to support affirmative actions towards refugees, Salzman and Carey focus more on the implications of immigration on right-wing political movements and the need to address underlying issues causing migration."	0.0009705	affirmative action	txt/2138443158.xml.txt	4

In Malaysia, race-based policies were implemented to give preferential treatment to the majority Muslim Malay population over the ethnic Chinese population. These policies were meant to help Malays catch up with the generally wealthier ethnic Chinese but have been criticized for benefiting the well-off within the Malay group and exacerbating ethnic tensions. The text draws parallels between the affirmative action debate in the U.S. and Malaysia, highlighting concerns about the effectiveness of such policies and their impact on racial and ethnic relations.

The author, Jason L. Riley, presents a critical perspective on affirmative action. He argues that these policies often end up benefiting those who are already well-off rather than the intended underprivileged groups. Riley questions the effectiveness of affirmative action in achieving its goals, citing examples where groups have progressed economically without such policies. He also highlights instances where affirmative action has been linked to discrimination and tensions, both in Malaysia and the U.S. Overall, the author seems to be skeptical about the efficacy and fairness of affirmative action policies."	0.0010585	affirmative action	txt/2154417607.xml.txt	4

The author also highlights the potential benefits of a capital gains tax cut for the CBC, such as enabling them to replace targeted tax incentives and form alliances with the Republican Congress.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be that policies promoting investment in black businesses, such as a capital gains tax cut, could eventually eliminate the need for affirmative action by creating more opportunities for black entrepreneurs and workers.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that Clinton's approach of ""mend it, don't end it"" reflects a carefully calibrated response to public opinion, guided by polling data.

The author argues against the idea that the test is culturally biased or solely reflects family income, pointing out that Asian-Americans outscore whites on the SAT. The author suggests that the focus should be on improving the academic preparation of minority students rather than lowering standards or blaming the SAT for disparities in admissions.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is critical of efforts to eliminate standardized tests like the SAT as a means to increase diversity in universities.

In the 1980s, participation in job training programs among black women decreased, leading to a disparity in access to training programs between white and black women. The study also highlighted that the intensity of job training experiences led to higher wages for women, regardless of the duration of the program, educational level, or work history.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is that businesses should increase the accessibility of job training programs for black working women to address historical disparities and increase diversity. They advocate for expanding job training opportunities for all individuals rather than denying access to some.

The text argues that the economic disparities faced by black farmers are rooted in a history of government-approved racial bias, justifying reparations as a means to redress this legacy. The author supports the idea of reparations as a form of compensation for historical injustices and contrasts it with the contentious debates around affirmative action.

The author, who had advocated for affirmative action in his youth, is initially upset with his son's stance but eventually comes to see his point of view. The author acknowledges that his son, coming from a privileged background, may not need affirmative action, but argues that it is still necessary to help less privileged students who face social disadvantages. The author suggests that while affirmative action may have been necessary in the past to address racial disparities, it can now be more targeted towards students who truly need assistance. The author's perspective is that affirmative action should continue to exist to provide equal opportunities to all students, especially those facing adversity.

The author's perspective on affirmative action is one of nuanced understanding, recognizing the need for assistance for those facing social disadvantages while also acknowledging that the program should be refined to target those who truly need help.

"The author reflects on their experience growing up in a black Republican family and their father's loyalty to the Republican Party despite the party's stance on civil rights issues. The author discusses how their father and other black Republicans in the past, such as Art Fletcher, were committed to advancing opportunities for minorities through initiatives like the Philadelphia Plan, which was an early form of affirmative action. However, the author notes that in more recent times, some black Republicans seem to be motivated by different reasons, such as enjoying unsettling people or avoiding competition within the Democratic Party. The author ultimately shares their journey of shifting political values and leaving the Republican Party to become a Democrat, feeling that the era of black Republicans like their father had passed.

The author's perspective on affirmative action seems to be positive, as they highlight the efforts of historical figures like Art Fletcher in creating opportunities for minorities through initiatives like the Philadelphia Plan.

The author expresses skepticism and criticism towards the newly recognized 57 multiethnic categories of the 2000 census, suggesting that the U.S. is not genuinely concerned about rectifying past racial injustices. The author argues that the collection of this convoluted ethnic data serves conservative political motivations rather than promoting cultural pluralism. They believe that this complex data makes it challenging to monitor and legislate affirmative action and other race-based programs, benefiting Eurocentric Americans who oppose reparations for historically oppressed groups. The author questions the validity and purpose of these new categories, advocating for a focus on socio-economic factors rather than race identification in modern political and economic forecasting. They suggest that until the government clarifies the necessity of these 57 categories, ethnic groups should continue to identify with traditional race categories and that minority groups should not be unfairly burdened with dividing into multiple subgroups while whites are not asked to do the same.	0.0008515	affirmative action	txt/421609713.xml.txt	4

"The text discusses the University of California's new admissions policies, which will now consider factors beyond academic qualifications, such as athletic or artistic ability, and a student's struggle against poverty. The author, Edwin A. Locke, criticizes these changes, arguing that they aim to eliminate the concepts of fairness and objectivity from the admissions process. Locke is particularly critical of the subjective nature of the new guidelines, suggesting that they may lead to hidden agendas and politicization in the admissions process. He also expresses concerns about the potential reintroduction of race as a factor in admissions despite explicit disclaimers against it. Locke believes that the new criteria will disadvantage academically qualified students and undermine the concept of academic competence in favor of egalitarianism.

Locke's perspective on affirmative action is clear: he opposes it and sees it as a means to promote a subjective admissions process that undermines academic excellence and fairness. He argues that affirmative action may lead to discrimination against academically qualified students and suggests that the new admissions criteria are a way to circumvent legal challenges related to discrimination based on race.

The author, David Whitman, discusses the aftermath of the Miami riot and challenges the prevailing perspective that racial discrimination is the sole cause of race riots. Whitman argues that while discrimination was a factor in igniting the riot, the roots of racial violence in Miami are deeper and primarily stem from class conflict. He highlights the widening class gap within urban black communities, where the growth of the black middle class has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack access to higher education and better job opportunities. Whitman criticizes affirmative action as a strategy to address these issues, suggesting that it creates division among ethnic groups and working-class whites, while failing to effectively help the most disadvantaged segments of the black community. He advocates for programs directed specifically towards poor blacks to ensure full employment, increase job opportunities for teenagers, and reform the welfare system.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as discussed in the text, seems to be critical of the Bush Administration's approach.

"The text discusses the controversial book ""The Bell Curve"" by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which focuses on the relationship between race, IQ scores, and societal outcomes. The authors argue that there is a significant IQ gap between blacks and whites, which they claim has implications for social policy, including advocating for the abolition of affirmative action and welfare programs. The text criticizes the authors for rehashing old ideas, drawing parallels to the views of William Shockley who advocated for sterilization of individuals with low IQs.

The author's perspective on affirmative action, as reflected in Dole's reversal on the issue, is critical. The author sees Dole's change in stance on affirmative action as a sign of lacking principle and consistency, suggesting that it was a self-serving move to align himself with a popular figure rather than standing by his own beliefs.

Carnesale acknowledges the challenges posed by recent policies in California that limit the use of race or ethnicity in admissions decisions, leading to a decrease in the number of Hispanic and black students admitted to UCLA Law School. He emphasizes the need to maintain diversity by encouraging eligible minority students to apply and enroll, engaging with high schools to increase minority eligibility, and striving for equal opportunity in education for all children. Carnesale also clarifies that while Proposition 209 prohibits preferential treatment based on race or ethnicity, universities still consider qualities beyond academic scores in admissions, such as unique talents, experiences, and backgrounds.

The author praises Clinton for his courage, skill, and persistence in addressing the complex issue of race. The discussion lacked focus and energy until Clinton raised the topic of affirmative action, particularly referencing the Army's successful strategies for promoting minority soldiers. The author suggests that a more structured and planned approach to future town meetings could lead to more fruitful discussions on race-related issues.

Regarding affirmative action, the author seems to view it as a nuanced issue that warrants thoughtful discussion. The author highlights the success of affirmative action in the Army in promoting diversity, contrasting it with the need for a deeper exploration of the differences between affirmative action and racial preferences.

The text discusses the author's perspective on affirmative action, focusing on contrasting outcomes in California and Texas regarding college admissions policies. Lani Guinier highlights the negative impact of eliminating affirmative action in California, leading to a decrease in the admission of black, Hispanic, and American Indian students and concerns about resegregation in higher education. In contrast, Texas implemented the 10 percent plan after the ban on considering race in admissions, which led to increased diversity and access to public education. Guinier praises Texas for its approach, emphasizing that the plan treats all groups equally and has resulted in improved opportunities for minority students and rural white students. The author argues that Texas's inclusive policies and focus on education have led to closing the achievement gap and improving overall student performance, contrasting this with California's struggles in education due to divisive politics.

3	The discussion is relevant as it highlights the importance of considering group subordination in constitutional protections against discrimination and the impact of misinterpretations of past cases on current laws and policies.	somewhat_in_favor	The author, Ian Haney Lopez, argues that Hernandez v. Texas set a precedent for constitutional protection for groups facing systematic oppression by focusing on group subordination rather than just racial distinctions.

The author suggests that Hernandez should be given more prominence alongside Brown in shaping a robust 14th Amendment law aimed at ending racial subordination. Lopez believes that revisiting Hernandez's emphasis on group subordination could help correct the distortions in constitutional antidiscrimination law and provide a more nuanced understanding of when affirmative action and other race-conscious measures are necessary to address systemic inequalities."	0.001257	affirmative action	txt/432763623.xml.txt	4
