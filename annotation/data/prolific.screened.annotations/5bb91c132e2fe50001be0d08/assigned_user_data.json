But they might open the way for efforts to work out the larger issues, most urgently arms control, next year.  One negative principle is important. This is not a time - if there ever is a time - when either side should undertake to put the other to a test.  At a minimum the two countries do not want the tensions between them to become more dangerous.

That is to ease up on the repression of dissidents. The potent symbolic step would be to release the three most prominent victims of the repression: Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Shcharansky.  Andrei Sakharov, the great physicist exiled to Gorky and harassed there by the K.G.B., wrote a letter to scientific colleagues in the Soviet Union and abroad that is published in the current New York Review of Books. It is a heart-rending document.  The Sakharov letter appeals for help in getting the Soviet authorities to let his wife, Elena Bonner, go abroad for medical treatment. She has had several heart attacks and has no way of getting proper care. In a further message dated Jan. 12, Mr. Sakharov said: ''Only a trip to receive medical treatment abroad can save her life, and mine as well, since her death would mean my death.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yuri Orlov, another physicist, was arrested seven years ago for setting up a committee to monitor Soviet compliance with the Helsinki agreements. He has reportedly been treated with special harshness in a labor camp at Perm. He was due for release from there this past Friday - but some experts fear that his term will be extended.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anatoly Shcharansky, an activist in both the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, has been in prison in Chistopol for nearly six years now.

Those on the right want to impose state-level bans on teaching critical race theory in public schools. Some also want to remove particular books from libraries and curriculums. On the left, people want to teach about America's history of racism and contemporary systemic racism but from only one perspective, with little if any room for debate. They deny CRT is being taught. I don't believe these are really the only options. Schools can and should teach about race and racism while upholding this nation's liberal values of free inquiry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know firsthand that American public schools are suffering from highly ideological instruction. I recently received an email from Maryland's Montgomery County Public Schools, where I have two children enrolled in 11th grade, updating parents on an \"Antiracist Audit\" the school system is undertaking. The report describes a new proposed social-studies curriculum, which \"strengthens students' sense of racial, ethnic, and tribal identities, helps students understand and resist systems of oppression, and empowers students to see themselves as change agents.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I don't know if this technically constitutes CRT, and I don't care. What I do know is that this sort of teaching is highly prescriptive. It doesn't sound open in the least to alternative interpretation or debate. It doesn't invite inquiry or encourage critical thinking. It imparts opinion\u2014that the American system currently oppresses specific people in specific ways\u2014as fact. While there is certainly racism in America, how much of it, where it exists and doesn't exist, and what it explains and doesn't explain about the lives of black Americans and other people of color aren't settled questions and should be open to discussion and debate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish I could say I was shocked by the audit report's announcement. But the sort of opinion-laden pedagogy it proposed adding to the social-studies curriculum is already a big part of my kids' education. My 16-year-old son has complained bitterly about the discussion of racism at his high school. It's not that he doesn't want to discuss race or racism\u2014he does\u2014but that he doesn't want to be told precisely what to think about every social issue. So saturated has the discussion become about race in school, he told me, that his physics class devoted time to it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His English teacher recently asked him point-blank what he thinks the black American experience is in America today. \"I wanted to say that I think black people are as different from each other as white people are, but I could never say that in class,\" he told me. Instead, he kept silent. Kids are expected to parrot back only one answer: To be black in America is to suffer continuous discrimination and indignation. There is nothing wrong with holding this view, but it clearly isn't shared by everyone in the black community.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In my son's weekly current-events class, which discusses contemporary social issues, something he normally loves to do, every single issue\u2014from sexuality to crime to immigration\u2014is discussed through \"a racial equity lens,\" with no room for alternative interpretations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least in college he should get some reprieve. He's ruled out going to a small liberal-arts school, so he won't be stuck in a hermetically sealed ideological bubble forever.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My son's experience is far from unique. There is a reason significant numbers of Virginians who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 went on in 2021 to vote in a Republican governor who pledged to push back on CRT instruction. They saw the assignments their children brought home and overheard the Zoom classroom discussions and were rightly horrified.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the new governor, in response to these encroachments on American liberal values, signed an executive order aimed at ending the use of \"divisive concepts\" in Virginia schools. While some of the examples the order uses to define these concepts are truly violative of existing civil-rights law, it is not always so narrowly tailored. It also seeks to stop curriculum or other education-related policy from including the idea that \"members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex or faith.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That example is so vaguely worded that it could conceivably be interpreted as a prohibition against teaching various sides of the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> debate or even about Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences, which would normally be part of a social-studies curriculum. It could certainly make teachers more reluctant to hold discussions on such matters. The executive order's ban is also \"not limited\" to the specific examples it raises and could theoretically deter other important classroom conversations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my high-school-age children to learn about the history of this country, including the \"1619\" version. I want them to understand America's legacy of race and racism, chattel slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and red lining. I want them to know that there is still racism in this nation today and about the troubling disparities in various institutions, especially the criminal-justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But students like my son should also be exposed to more than one opinion on why there are still racial disparities in America. There's no shortage of rigorous scholarship on the matter. Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has written several books about the complex role of both systemic and cultural factors in inner-city communities. Columbia linguist John McWhorter, while acknowledging the continuing role of systemic racism, similarly sees other variables at work, including family structure. Brown University economist Glenn Loury has questioned many of the left's pieties on systemic oppression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teaching multiple perspectives and the \"1619\" and \"1776\" versions of American history would be the best way to encourage open inquiry. Students could read Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller \"How to Be an Antiracist\" alongside one of the many articles or books by writers like Messrs. Loury, McWhorter and Patterson. Kids would hear theories about \"systems of oppression,\" but they would also hear about the role that class and cultural differences play in disparity. In short, they would receive multiple narratives and explanations about why America is the way it is today and decide for themselves what to think and do about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I want my kids to get a good education.

And I\u2019m not the only one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than two decades, I've tried to make sense of political currents in both parties, often to the consternation of readers on both sides. I've been called a corporatist and Republican apologist; more often, I'm called an elitist who pumps out Democratic talking points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all that time, I have not felt as utterly repulsed from the mainstream of both parties as I do right now. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job \u2014 a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich \u2014 who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote \u2014 that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did.

And I\u2019m not the only one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than two decades, I've tried to make sense of political currents in both parties, often to the consternation of readers on both sides. I've been called a corporatist and Republican apologist; more often, I'm called an elitist who pumps out Democratic talking points.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all that time, I have not felt as utterly repulsed from the mainstream of both parties as I do right now. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like most kids who grew up politically engaged in the Northeast, I started political life as a registered Democrat, casting my first presidential vote for Michael Dukakis. In my mid-20s, while a city desk reporter at the Boston Globe, I changed my registration to independent, and I've never gone back.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For many years, when I told curious politicos or readers that I was an independent, they would nod knowingly, as if we both understood this was a necessity of the job \u2014 a veneer covering my obviously leftist sensibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, I never thought party registration had anything to do with my credibility as a reporter. I chose to be an independent because, temperamentally and intellectually, that's how I'm wired.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wasn't comfortable with the increasing tribalism of party politics. And once you've covered cops, courts and housing projects in cities such as Boston and New York, it's hard to maintain a belief that government has all the answers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through six presidential campaigns and counting, I have found much to disdain in both parties but also plenty to admire. I like politicians generally, and I've written positively about both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Barack Obama, Mark R. Warner, Chris Christie, John Kasich \u2014 who had the courage to rethink old orthodoxies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have never bought into the idea that journalists shouldn't vote \u2014 that refraining from the exercise of citizenship somehow made us any less biased. I've voted Democratic in most elections, if not always enthusiastically, and I've cast ballots for Republicans and third-party candidates, too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which is to say that, like a growing number of Americans who eschew party affiliations, I leaned in one direction more often than not, but I wasn't a loyalist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lately, however, I find myself feeling not so much ambivalent about the parties as alienated. I'm confronted with two extreme interpretations of what it means to be American, and I emphatically reject them both.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems self-evident that the Republican Party \u2014 more a celebrity fan club than a political organization at this point \u2014 would, if left to its own devices, destroy the foundation of the republic. I never thought I'd write those words about any U.S. political party, but here we are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Donald Trump and his imitators would blow up the integrity of our elections, or that they have expressly countenanced a violent insurrection against the federal government, or that they basically admit to having no governing agenda beyond the reclamation of some mythical White heritage.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's also that the Trumpist GOP advances the notion, in all kinds of ways, that citizenship alone doesn't mean you belong here \u2014 that your race or ethnicity, the language that you speak, or the identity you choose can somehow make you less American than your neighbor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen this interpretation of Americanism before \u2014 in segregated schools and diners, in the internment of Japanese Americans, in populist disdain for Catholics and Jews. No patriotic American should entertain it, and no politician with an ounce of integrity would excuse it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You might think, given this Republican calamity, that any political alternative would be sufficient. And, yes, a party that doesn't seek to limit ballot access and install an autocrat is definitely a step up.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that doesn't mean a lot of us who consider ourselves liberal feel kinship with today's Democratic Party \u2014 or that we'd even be welcome if we did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rather than focus on traditional American ideals of citizenship over race or origin, the left is in thrall to its own misguided cultural revolution (yes, I use the term deliberately), embracing a vision of the United States that lays waste to the 20th-century liberalism of its greatest icons.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've always liked and respected President Biden, and in most ways he has governed well. His $1.2 trillion infrastructure package was a major achievement. His efforts to counter the pandemic have been steady. He seems poised to make a historic addition to the Supreme Court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of his successes, though, there's a fire raging in his party that Biden hasn't even tried to control \u2014 and probably couldn't extinguish if he did.

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue.

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise.

Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . .

But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts. But the only time they utter the words \"left wing\" is when they're talking about an airplane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives must be identified because the audience needs to know these are people with axes to grind. But liberals don't need to be identified because their views on all the big social issues -- from abortion and gun control to the death penalty and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> -- aren't liberal views at all. They're simply reasonable views, shared by all the reasonable people the media elites mingle with at all their reasonable dinner parties in Manhattan and Georgetown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reporters pride themselves on their skepticism. Yet many uncritically pass along the views of liberal activists in a way they would never do with conservatives. The homeless lobby tells the media there are five million homeless and 10 minutes later it's on the evening news.

Board of Education tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Supreme Court to adopt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 1954 case was a great victory for the civil-rights movement and especially for the NAACP where Mr. Marshall worked. The justices finally declared that separate but equal facilities were unconstitutional. A filibuster in the Senate perpetuated Jim Crow segregation, so it was appropriate that the court struck down these racist laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that Brown is a classic example of a correct result reached by lousy reasoning. The opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren was based almost entirely on dubious sociological data on how much better black students supposedly learn when they study in the same classrooms as whites. A famous footnote cites behavior studies in publications such as the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research. It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal,\" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing \"Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court missed the forest for the trees. \"The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,\" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the \"first principles of equality and liberty\" would \"lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. \"The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,\" the brief said. \"Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, \"Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,\" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is \"not without some good points,\" he said, adding that \"if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>On Brown v.

It's now clear that this case was the beginning of an era of judicial activism that substituted shadows, penumbras and judicial social engineering for adherence to constitutional text and original intent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are nearly identical arguments about what the Brown opinion should have said in Mr. Marshall's legal briefs in the case and Judge Thomas's recent speeches and law-review articles. They agreed that the court should have based its decision on legal and constitutional sources, not sociologists. They both referred to the Declaration of Independence's self-evident truth that \"all men are created equal,\" which finally applied to blacks after the Civil War through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's brief and Judge Thomas's writings both cited Justice Harlan's dissent from the 1896 case that established the doctrine of separate but equal, Plessy v. Ferguson. Justice Harlan would instead have given the Fourteenth Amendment its commonsense reading, which is that it was intended to replace slavery with equality by forbidding the government from treating people differently by race. The amendment promised blacks all the privileges and immunities of citizenship and equal protection of the laws.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Thomas wrote that if the opinion in Brown had adopted this broader view of the Fourteenth Amendment, separate but equal could have been invalidated without citing \"Kenneth Clark's controversial doll studies, which could just as easily have been used in support of segregation as against it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The court missed the forest for the trees. \"The Brown focus on environment overlooks the real problem with segregation, its origin in slavery, which was at fundamental odds with the founding principles. Had Brown done so, it would have been forced to talk about slavery, which it never mentions,\" Judge Thomas wrote. He said that a better understanding of the \"first principles of equality and liberty\" would \"lead us above petty squabbling over `quotas,' `<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>' and race-conscious remedies of social ills.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once on the Supreme Court, Mr. Marshall supported quotas, but he made some of the same points about a colorblind Constitution in his brief in Brown. \"The roots of our American egalitarian ideal extend deep into the history of the Western world,\" the brief said. \"Philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced an intellectual climate in which the equality of man was a central concept. Their beliefs rested upon the basic proposition that all man are endowed with certain natural rights.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Marshall's reference to natural rights is important because Judge Thomas's critics accuse him of weirdness for using similar terms. For different reasons, it's important reassurance for both liberals and conservatives to understand why Judge Thomas wrote about natural rights. The reason was his search as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for a more enduring guarantee of equality than the fleeting legal standards in Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Liberals should know that Judge Thomas is not on a goose chase for penumbras or emanations from the Constitution into which he can insert his conservative policy preferences-as Justice Marshall too often did to enact his liberal views. Conservatives should know that he invokes natural rights in the service of original-intent jurisprudence. His law review article, \"Toward a `Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation,\" stressed that terms must be read according to their original meaning. Individual liberty is constitutionally protected, but group rights are not; discrimination must be punished, but not by mandating quotas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The NAACP's Mr. Hooks recently noted this distinction. Judge Thomas is \"not without some good points,\" he said, adding that \"if a black or a woman has been individually discriminated against or mistreated he'll go to the ends of the earth to correct it.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it turns out there's not much difference between Justice Marshall and Judge Thomas on the broadest issues of civil rights. It will be fascinating to see if the NAACP has the courage to abandon its usual liberal allies who hope to do to Judge Thomas what they did to Robert Bork.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1014285656.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1014285656.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>A Little Bit Indian</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I still have a picture on my mantel and it is a picture my mother had before that -- a picture of my grandfather.

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "displayed_text": "<p>TESTING THE WATERS DROPPING THE SAT WOULD MEAN FAILING STUDENTS</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Got a weight problem? Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college.
