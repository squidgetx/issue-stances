Every word, that is, except two: \"advice\" and \"consent.\" The plain meaning of these words is not hard to fathom, nor is their authors' intent. Senatorial \"advice and consent\" on the president's judicial nominations was a compromise between those who thought the president should appoint judges and those who thought Congress should do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least when the White House is Republican and the Senate is Democratic, however, conservatives discover all sorts of doctrines in the word \"consent\" that are far from clear to the naked eye. Senators musn't consider the nominee's ideology. They must never ask or consider how the nominee might vote on specific issues or cases. As for the word \"advice,\" fuggedabadit. At Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Tuesday about standards for approving judicial nominations, all the energy on the conservative side was about piling limitations on the Senate's power of consent. Only a liberal suggested that maybe the Constitution is trying to tell us that presidents should seek the Senate's advice in choosing his nominees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's straighten out a few concepts here. Ideology can mean the sum of your views on all political issues: welfare, taxes, trade with China, etc. Yes, of course, senators should not consider a would-be judge's politics -- except to ensure as best they can that the judge won't consider them either in his or her rulings. But ideology can also mean your specific philosophy on judicial matters: the role of precedent, the meaning of the 14th Amendment, and so on. And senators of course can and should inquire about this kind of ideology and vote yea or nea on that basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives generally accept this distinction. But they muddle it by presenting their own preferred judicial ideology -- a flurry of bromidic phrases: \"judicial restraint,\" \"strict construction,\" \"original intent\" -- as a piety beyond legitimate dispute. So any liberal challenge to a conservative nominee is automatically \"ideological\" in the bad sense, while every conservative challenge to a liberal nominee is based on philosophical principle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conservatives' judicial philosophy is not beyond legitimate dispute. First of all, they themselves happily overlook it when it is inconvenient. \"Advice and consent\" is a ripe example. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is another: Conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn policies of the elected branches. They sincerely believe, no doubt, that this is a case where the Constitution speaks clearly and judicial restraint is inappropriate. But that's the point: Their buzzwords don't provide an unfailing guide even for them, let alone a beacon of truth so bright that the path it illuminates is the only one worth taking. Waving a wand called \"strict construction\" can't fully illuminate purposely vague phrases like \"cruel and unusual.\" Invoking \"original intent\" won't tell you what the authors' original intent was about dealing with changing circumstances.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If \"advice and consent\" is entitled to anything close to its plain, original meaning, the Senate is perfectly entitled to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject some on that basis. Scrutiny includes asking nominees their views and their reasoning about fairly specific legal issues, if not actual pending cases. Why not? After all, sitting judges write long opinions day after day telling us what they think about many issues that will come up again, but no one regards that as a problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Needless to say, it would be wrong for Senate Democrats to let considerations of sauce for the gander influence their thinking on this issue. President Bush would never let political considerations influence his judicial choices. When he campaigned last fall on a promise to nominate justices like Scalia and Thomas, he must have had in mind some other way in which those two gentlemen are alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for eight years of Republican harassment and blocking of President Clinton's nominees, Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed at Tuesday's hearing that this is entirely a figment of your imagination. That's right -- it never happened!

Bolick noted that his organization didn't oppose any of Clinton's Supreme Court nominees. He did not mention his ferocious campaign against Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's nominee for head of civil rights at the Justice Department. Ordinarily, a president's choices for his own administration are thought to deserve more deference, not less, than his nominations for lifetime appointments to the independent judiciary. But an Institute of Justice press release at the time (1997 again) argued that the advice and consent clause actually obliges senators to oppose nominees with erroneous views \"when the stakes are high enough.\" The stakes in this case were in essence that Bolick's group favored judicial activism -- judges overthrowing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> plans -- and Lee did not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Institute of Justice Web site describes it as dedicated to opposing \"racial preferences\" and \"the welfare state\" and as a \"courtroom champion\" for \"free market solutions and limited government.\" But Bolick testified Tuesday that \"mere philosophical differences\" shouldn't play a role in the Senate's approval of judges -- and, what's more, they never had.

Ronald Reagan summoned UC President Clark Kerr to a private meeting in a UC Berkeley conference room. Six hours later, the popular and effective Kerr was fired as punishment for his soft stance on the Free Speech Movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, a shocked Faculty Senate decried the \"repressive political atmosphere\" and worried about its effects on the quality of higher education in California. Students felt betrayed by what they considered Reagan's bald political aspirations. The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper, went so far as to ask: \"Just who runs this university, anyway?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost 30 years later, the UC system faces the same question. This time around, the cause of the trouble is not student protests or a war in Vietnam, but <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Again, politics has reared its disruptive head in the realm of education, with consequences as troubling as those surrounding Kerr's ouster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tug-o'-war began last July, when the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring. Regents were immediately accused of using the UC system to further the political ambitions of Gov. Pete Wilson. After all, Wilson and his Republican predecessors had appointed many of their closest allies to the board and his presidential campaign was in need of a boost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The controversial change in policy sent the nine UC campuses into a frenzy. All nine chancellors opposed the resolution, as did every student government. Activists called for non-compliance, culminating in a huge systemwide walkout on Oct. 12. Most important, the Faculty Senate called for the regents to reverse course, contending that their decision violated the concept of \"shared governance,\" in which regents, UC president, chancellors and faculty strive for consensus before major policy changes are set in motion. Enter Richard C. Atkinson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five months ago, in the midst of the furor spawned by the regents' <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> decision and accusations of political pandering, Atkinson was chosen the new UC president. His first big job was to implement the new policy and draft guidelines that would replace race and gender preferences with socioeconomic criteria.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most introductory political science professors know that if a bureaucracy opposes a new policy directive, that policy will most likely go nowhere. Thus, it wasn't all that surprising when Atkinson announced that he was delaying full implementation of the regents' policy, until fall 1998 for undergraduates, to allow his bureaucracy to come up with suitable alternative guidelines.

Ronald Reagan summoned UC President Clark Kerr to a private meeting in a UC Berkeley conference room. Six hours later, the popular and effective Kerr was fired as punishment for his soft stance on the Free Speech Movement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, a shocked Faculty Senate decried the \"repressive political atmosphere\" and worried about its effects on the quality of higher education in California. Students felt betrayed by what they considered Reagan's bald political aspirations. The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper, went so far as to ask: \"Just who runs this university, anyway?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost 30 years later, the UC system faces the same question. This time around, the cause of the trouble is not student protests or a war in Vietnam, but <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Again, politics has reared its disruptive head in the realm of education, with consequences as troubling as those surrounding Kerr's ouster.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tug-o'-war began last July, when the UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate race and gender preferences in admissions and hiring. Regents were immediately accused of using the UC system to further the political ambitions of Gov. Pete Wilson. After all, Wilson and his Republican predecessors had appointed many of their closest allies to the board and his presidential campaign was in need of a boost.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The controversial change in policy sent the nine UC campuses into a frenzy. All nine chancellors opposed the resolution, as did every student government. Activists called for non-compliance, culminating in a huge systemwide walkout on Oct. 12. Most important, the Faculty Senate called for the regents to reverse course, contending that their decision violated the concept of \"shared governance,\" in which regents, UC president, chancellors and faculty strive for consensus before major policy changes are set in motion. Enter Richard C. Atkinson.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Five months ago, in the midst of the furor spawned by the regents' <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> decision and accusations of political pandering, Atkinson was chosen the new UC president. His first big job was to implement the new policy and draft guidelines that would replace race and gender preferences with socioeconomic criteria.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most introductory political science professors know that if a bureaucracy opposes a new policy directive, that policy will most likely go nowhere. Thus, it wasn't all that surprising when Atkinson announced that he was delaying full implementation of the regents' policy, until fall 1998 for undergraduates, to allow his bureaucracy to come up with suitable alternative guidelines.

For example, among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 annually, more than 33 percent of whites own computers, compared with only 19 percent of African-Americans -- a gap that has widened 64 percent over the past five years despite declining computer prices.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The implications go far beyond on-line trading and chat rooms.

In a process that the sociologist Orlando Patterson calls ''social death,'' slavery sought to sever blacks from their history and culture, from family ties and a sense of community. And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors.

And, of course, de jure segregation after the Civil War was intended to disconnect blacks from equal economic opportunity, from the network of social contacts that enable upward mobility and, indeed, from the broader world of ideas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the dramatic growth of the black middle class since <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs were started in the late 60's, new forms of disconnectedness have afflicted black America. Middle-class professionals often feel socially and culturally isolated from their white peers at work and in the neighborhood and from their black peers left behind in the underclass. The children of the black underclass, in turn, often lack middle-class role models to help them connect to a history of achievement and develop their analytical skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a sad irony if the most diverse and decentralized electronic medium yet invented should fail to achieve ethnic diversity among its users. And yet the Commerce Department study suggests that the solution will require more than cheap PC's. It will involve content.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until recently, the African-American presence on the Internet was minimal, reflecting the chicken-and-egg nature of Internet economics. Few investors have been willing to finance sites appealing to a PC-scarce community. Few African-Americans have been compelled to sign on to a medium that offers little to interest them. And educators interested in diversity have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of minority-oriented educational software.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the birth of the recording industry in the 1920's. Blacks began to respond to this new medium only when mainstream companies like Columbia Records introduced so-called race records, blues and jazz discs aimed at a nascent African-American market. Blacks who would never have dreamed of spending hard-earned funds for a record by Rudy Vallee or Kate Smith would stand in lines several blocks long to purchase the new Bessie Smith or Duke Ellington hit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New content made the new medium attractive. And the growth of Web sites dedicated to the interests and needs of black Americans can play the same role for the Internet that race records did for the music industry.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even making sites that will appeal to a black audience can only go so far. The causes of poverty are both structural and behavioral. And it is the behavioral aspect of this cybersegregation that blacks themselves are best able to address. Drawing on corporate and foundation support, we can transform the legion of churches, mosques and community centers in our inner cities into after-school centers that focus on redressing the digital divide and teaching black history. We can draw on the many examples of black achievement in structured classes to re-establish a sense of social connection.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Internet is the 21st century's talking drum, the very kind of grass-roots communication tool that has been such a powerful source of education and culture for our people since slavery. But this talking drum we have not yet learned to play. Unless we master the new information technology to build and deepen the forms of social connection that a tragic history has eroded, African-Americans will face a form of cybersegregation in the next century as devastating to our aspirations as Jim Crow segregation was to those of our ancestors. But this time, the fault will be our own.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illustration (Stephen Doyle)</p></div>"}, "test_question_pro_testing_1": {"id": "test_question_pro_testing_1", "text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds.

Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants.

When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty.

The right thinks he's an unapologetic liberal who slants the news leftward -- not because he is, but because his critics are so hopelessly biased themselves that they wouldn't know straight news when they saw it. As another evening star, Peter Jennings, told Larry King recently, bias often is in the eye of the beholder. And since Tom Brokaw also has publicly denied a liberal bias, it's official.

Messrs. Rather, Brokaw and Jennings don't even know what liberal bias is. I concede this is hard to believe, but I'm convinced it's why we keep getting these ridiculous denials, such as Mr. Rather's response to Geraldo Rivera the other night. Geraldo said, \"What I can't figure out is why you rub the right so wrong.\" Dan thought it was because some people \"subscribe to the idea either you report the news the way we want you to report it, or we're gonna tag . . .

But real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack. Liberal bias is the result of how they see the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this: In 1996 after I wrote about liberal bias on this very page, Dan was furious and during a phone conversation he indicated that picking The Wall Street Journal to air my views was especially appalling given the conservative views of the paper's editorial page. \"What do you consider the New York Times?\" I asked him, since he had written op-eds for that paper. \"Middle of the road,\" he said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I couldn't believe he was serious. The Times is a newspaper that has taken the liberal side of every important social issue of our time, which is fine with me. But if you see the New York Times editorial page as middle of the road, one thing is clear: You don't have a clue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it is this inability to see liberal views as liberal that is at the heart of the entire problem. This is why Phyllis Schlafly is the conservative woman who heads that conservative organization but Patricia Ireland is merely the head of NOW. No liberal labels necessary. Robert Bork is the conservative judge. Laurence Tribe is the noted Harvard law professor. Rush Limbaugh is the conservative talk show host. Rosie O'Donnell is simply Rosie O'Donnell, no matter how many liberal opinions she shares with her audience.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's why the media stars can so easily talk about \"right wing\" Republicans and \"right wing\" Christians and \"right wing\" Miami Cubans and \"right wing\" radio talk-show hosts.
