Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced recently that he is worried about the \"hard, hard right\" of the Republican Party, people whose goal is to turn \"the clock back to the 1930s or the 1890s.\" I've never met one myself. There is no such Republican in the president's Cabinet, none in the Senate, and Schumer is talking nonsense. He wants to conceal the Big Switch that has transformed American politics. Today the Democrats are the party of reactionary liberalism. Republicans are the true progressives.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet if Schumer is mostly wrong, he is also unintentionally revealing. He seems to believe that \"hard right\" Republicans pine for the 1930s -- when statesmen like FDR and his disciples dominated the scene. He's right: Many Republicans do admire FDR. Republicans, after all, are his spiritual heirs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is serious business. If you agree that President Bush has no automatic right to call himself Lincoln's successor just because they are both \"Republicans,\" then Democrats have no automatic right to FDR's mantle either. The Democrats and Republicans switched roles while no one was looking.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schumer is a main man for the Dems, architect of a fine new way of holding a knife to the Senate's throat. Democrats threaten to filibuster Bush judicial nominees; one touch of Schumer's magic wand and they can no longer be confirmed by majorities, only landslides. (How many Democratic senators won by landslides?) If Republicans change the rules to disallow such vindictiveness, Democrats promise to throw a fit and bring Senate business to a halt.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The filibuster scheme perfectly epitomizes modern Democrats. Republicans want to move forward, confirm some judges. The Democrats' response: Freeze! Or we talk you to death. Democrats are the Stand Still party. They adore the status quo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives won't settle for the status quo. They want this nation to champion justice, humanity, democracy. Democrats want America to tip-toe around the globe minding its own business, upsetting no one, venerating the Earth, etc. Why did Democrats leap to label Afghanistan and Iraq \"new Vietnams\"? Vietnam was 30-plus years ago! But for Democrats it is always 1974. Things change -- but Democrats don't.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans want better schools: Why not try vouchers on a serious scale? Democrats' response: Hands off! Republicans want to knock the chip off the U.N.'s shoulder and retune Social Security so that even the poor can leave assets to their children. Democrats' response: Hands off! Conservatives wonder, why not let the people's representatives in state legislatures determine the nation's abortion policy? Democrats' response: Are you crazy? The smelly masses? Why is it their business?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today's Democrats dislike democracy on principle, like Russian nobility circa 1905. Should Bush be allowed to pick federal judges merely because Republicans won the presidency, the Senate, the House, the country? No way! And why let the people decide about homosexual marriage when left-wing judges can make the law? Connecticut's governor just signed a law approving civil unions for gays and also stipulating that \"marriage\" means a man and a woman. Whatever you think of the outcome, this is democracy -- Schumerite Democrats should check it out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the nation's universities, an occasional conservative wonders whether just maybe racism, sexism and \"class-ism\" no longer explain every bad thing in the world. Could 30 years of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> be enough? There are tenured professors who can't even remember a world without it. The Democrats' response: Hands off <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people have noticed that today's political scene is confusing, hard to read -- Republicans wanting to save the world, Dems shouting \"mind your own business.\" Republicans worrying about poor people's stake in society, Dems muttering \"wake me up when it's over.\" Republicans sticking up for Israel, left-wing anti-Bush rallies toying with anti-Semitism. It's all terribly confusing, until you notice that you are looking at the picture upside down. Once you understand the Big Switch, everything starts to make sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Yale professor David Gelernter is a senior fellow at the Shalem Center, Jerusalem.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}

Have you been dieting but finding that the scale doesn't register any loss of poundage? Then let me make a suggestion: Get a hammer and smash the scale.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you think that sounds like a reasonable remedy, then you may qualify for membership on the Latino Eligibility Task Force for the University of California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month, the committee expressed alarm that once racial preferences are eliminated in undergraduate admissions and students are judged on their academic records and test scores, the number of Latinos enrolled in the University of California system will drop sharply. The task force's solution was not to find ways to improve the performance of Hispanic applicants. It was to get rid of the test on which Hispanics score low.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending use of the Scholastic Assessment Test would double the number of Hispanics who would qualify for admission to the University of California system. It would also increase the number of eligible blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no doubt that Hispanics and blacks do worse on the SAT than whites. Nationally, the average score for whites is 1,052, compared to an average of 909 for Mexican-Americans and 857 for African-Americans. If a selective school like the University of California at Berkeley or UCLA measures applicants partly by this yardstick, fewer Latinos and blacks will be admitted than under the old system of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics conclude this proves the malignant nature of the test. They say 1) that it is culturally biased, favoring whites over minorities, 2) that scores are related not to academic ability but, more than anything else, to family income and 3) that it doesn't predict performance in college, as it is supposed to.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The facts, regrettably, don't support the critics. If the test is culturally biased, why is it that Asian-Americans not only do better on the test than other minorities but also outscore whites? It's hard to imagine how the College Board could devise an exam that simultaneously favors kids whose parents left England on the Mayflower in 1620 and kids whose parents fled Vietnam as boat people in 1975. But if you believe the cultural bias theory, that's exactly what it has done.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FairTest, an anti-SAT group based in Cambridge, Mass., claims that scores merely reflect family income. Sure enough, its chart shows that the higher the family income, the better the score. What does this prove? Apparently, it has never occurred to the people at FairTest that rich people are smarter, on average, than poor people and that intelligence may actually come in handy if you want to make money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But dollars don't automatically translate into SAT points. Black students from the highest income category score about the same, on average, as the poorest whites. They also do worse on the math portion of the test than Asian-American students from the lowest income bracket.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The College Board doesn't deny that, in general, high school grades are a slightly better predictor of college success than the SAT. But together, the two measures tell more than either does by itself. And sometimes, grades are simply not very informative. Getting straight A's from a lousy school is easier than getting straight A's from an outstanding one. To compare graduates of the two schools, a different measure is needed--and that is where the SAT comes in.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let the critics have their way, and grades will be even less helpful. Grade inflation is already a problem in the nation's high schools, and if high school transcripts become the main basis for selecting University of California students, teachers will hand out even more A's than now.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expected decline in the number of blacks and Latinos in the University of California is the result of the poor academic preparation they get in elementary and secondary institutions--not from the unfairness of the SAT. The opponents of the test act as though the only tough part of college is getting in. But kids who are not ready for rigorous colleges won't gain much from being admitted.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In their new book, <i>America in Black and White</i>, Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom point out that 42 percent of black undergraduates drop out of Berkeley, compared to 16 percent of whites. Nationally, African-Americans are 50 percent more likely to quit college than whites--possibly because racial preferences funnel them into schools that are more demanding than many of them can handle. Unless the University of California lowers its academic expectations, measures to arbitrarily boost black and Latino enrollment will mean taking a lot of applicants who are likely to fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these students need is not lower standards but better grade schools and high schools, so that they are prepared for the demanding requirements of college. If the SAT shows that the schools are failing black and Hispanic kids, we shouldn't blame the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Steve Ansul.</p>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Strongly In Favor": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 57s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/398299761.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Blacks and Whites on Common Ground</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty-eight years after the Civil Rights Act, racial polarization continues to frustrate consensus on some of the most important issues facing our nation. But recent survey findings may foster mutual understanding by debunking one of the most pernicious myths underlying racial division: that blacks and whites have fundamentally different views and aspirations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This myth has fueled demagogues on both sides of the racial divide, especially in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. But poll results just released by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political Studies reveal that most blacks aspire like other Americans to safe streets, good schools and home ownership.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of equal import, the survey demonstrates that mainstream black Americans are far more conservative than most of the politicians and organizations that purport to speak for them. This philosophical gulf perhaps was most pronounced near the end of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, when national groups like the NAACP stridently opposed the Supreme Court nominee while blacks in general approved by a three-to-one ratio (along with some local NAACP chapters).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center study found that more blacks label themselves conservative (33%) than either liberal (28%) or moderate (31%). Young blacks 18 to 34 years old are more conservative, with 38% describing themselves as such.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But conservative blacks have not yet found a hospitable political home. A minuscule 5% of those surveyed are Republicans. The GOP's failure to attract like-minded blacks offers vivid testimony to years of hostility or neglect by Republicans toward matters of concern to black Americans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Poll findings on specific issues highlight common ground between whites and blacks. Despite opposition by establishment civil rights groups to capital punishment as racially discriminatory, the survey found most blacks favor the death penalty. This finding reflects serious concern about crime. More than half the blacks surveyed live within a few blocks of places they're afraid to walk in at night, and nearly half live in neighborhoods where young men carry guns.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Education is the number one election issue for black Americans, the survey found, and 75% support a \"back-to-basics\" direction. In sharp contrast to politicians and establishment civil rights leaders, an amazing 88% support a \"voucher\" system that would allow parents to choose the schools their children attend.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many other Americans, most blacks are skeptical about current welfare policies. Some 57% believe government should not increase aid when single mothers have more children, and 75% think such a policy change would encourage single women to have fewer children. The poll found 91% of blacks support opportunities for low-income people to become homeowners by buying their public housing, a centerpiece of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp's \"empowerment\" agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Joint Center poll echoes an earlier survey by Linda Lichter, which found a gulf over major issues between leaders of black organizations and randomly selected blacks. The survey found 77% of black leaders believed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be the most important factor in hiring and education decisions; indeed, National Urban League President John Jacob called this \"the one constant that must be shared by anyone who presumes to hold a leadership position in the black community.\" But the survey found most blacks would flunk this ideological litmus test. Some 77% believe ability rather than race should be the determining factor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, the Lichter survey found 68% of black leaders favoring forced busing for integration, while 53% of mainstream blacks opposed busing. Two-thirds of black leaders opposed the death penalty for murder, compared with 55% of all blacks who favored it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These findings contain powerful messages for both sides of the policy debate. They explain why liberal groups like the NAACP have lost thousands of members in recent years, particularly among younger blacks. By focusing on social engineering schemes such as racial quotas and set-asides that have little relevance to the real problems facing many blacks, the civil rights leadership elite is growing increasingly out of touch with its constituency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this regard, the leadership elite's problems are twofold. Racial preferences don't much aid a black underclass beset with ravaging crime, economic stagnation and inadequate schools. Likewise, the growing number of blacks who have joined the economic mainstream may have more in common with other middle class Americans than with those whose agenda remains rooted in the battles of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For conservatives, opportunities are apparent. But instead of partisan efforts, they should concentrate on specific issues in which common cause exists with mainstream blacks. Groups such as the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and the Institute for Justice have built potent coalitions with low-income people on such empowerment issues as school choice, tenant management of public housing, and challenges to regulatory barriers to entry-level entrepreneurial opportunities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If only by default, Bill Clinton likely will win the majority of black votes this November, and he mouthed the rhetoric of empowerment at the Democratic National Convention. But to the extent he caves into special interest groups -- he promised teachers unions he'd oppose school choice that includes private schools -- it could create openings for George Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush has fumbled on the race issue, capitulating on a divisive civil rights bill that means little to most blacks while failing to forcefully articulate a positive alternative. Mr. Bush needs to take his case directly to black Americans, presenting a clear agenda to create tangible opportunities for upward mobility.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus far he has not done so. Bush proposals on urban enterprise zones, tenant management, school choice and tax relief are pitched separately and dispassionately, rather than as a comprehensive package the Democrats can't match. The administration some time ago banished the \"E\" word -- empowerment -- from its official lexicon to keep Jack Kemp's star from shining too brightly. So long as it lacks a credible vision and messenger, the GOP richly deserves cynicism from blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regardless of its political or policy implications, the survey's most significant impact is to undermine the stereotype that all blacks think alike -- a stereotype perpetuated by establishment civil rights groups who punish those who dissent from establishment orthodoxy. Federal Appeals Court Judge Leon Higginbotham, for instance, recently scolded Justice Thomas in print for supposedly betraying his race by committing various perceived philosophical heresies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet it was the Thomas nomination itself that disproved this patronizing stereotype once and for all. For Justice Thomas personifies the American Dream of achievement based on merit and hard work. His rise from poverty and segregation marked a vindication of the ideas of equality and opportunity -- ideals to which blacks and whites alike are committed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Martin Luther King Jr. was perhaps the last civil rights leader to understand that. Instead of emphasizing differences among people the way contemporary civil rights leaders often do, he drew constantly upon the principles and aspirations that unite us as Americans, black and white, rich and poor. Indeed, the remaining task of the civil rights struggle is not to redistribute opportunities through a divisive and counterproductive racial spoils system, but to empower those who have been denied opportunities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is on the basis of these traditional American ideas that the problems facing the most disadvantaged members of our society can be surmounted -- and the sometimes seemingly insurmountable chasm between blacks and whites can be bridged.    ---    Mr. Bolick is litigation director at the Institute for Justice in Washington and author of \"Unfinished Business: A Civil Rights Strategy for America's Third Century\" (Pacific Research Institute, 1990).</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}

By offering an alarmist interpretation of the fact that blacks as a group score 15 points lower than whites in I.Q. tests, the book's authors are, in their words, bravely tackling \"a taboo issue\" or, as their critics have it, recklessly fanning the flames of racial division in a nation already at the brink.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But isn't it also possible that a publisher is simply hawking a book?  The incendiary \"science\" in \"The Bell Curve\" is not new; its policy prescriptions are conservative boilerplate. Had the authors compared the I.Q. scores of men and women, that might have been a cry of \"Fire!\" in a societal tinderbox. As \"The Bell Curve\" stands, however, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein might be more accurately charged with rehashing the work of others (and sometimes their own) for financial and political profit.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of those others is William Shockley, a memorable nut who argued a quarter-century ago in favor of sterilizing those with low I.Q.'s.  Shockley receives only one guarded paragraph in the 845 pages of \"The Bell Curve.\" Yet his old pronouncements are everywhere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shockley attributed the lower income and higher crime rates of blacks to the same 15-point I.Q. test differential. He concluded that \"a major cause of American Negroes' intellectual and social deficit is hereditary and racially genetic\" and \"not remediable to a major degree by practical improvement in environment.\" He bemoaned welfare for encouraging the procreation of the population's \"least effective elements,\" black and white.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more elegantly written \"Bell Curve\" has the same drift. Shockley bequeathed its authors their self-congratulatory tone as well: He boasted about raising \"questions that are usually swept under the rug\" as they do about breaking taboos. Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein also emulate Shockley by asserting expertise in academic disciplines (like genetics) outside their own and by protesting too much against those who might accuse them of making a fetish of race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the \"Bell Curve\" authors cannot add to the science and pseudo-science they selectively cull from their primary sources, they update Shockley's politics for the 1990's (<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should be abolished along with welfare) and tack on apocalyptic predictions of the sort found in best sellers heralding the next economic crash. \"The Bell Curve\" imagines a polarized, totalitarian Futureworld where the I.Q. elite will confine the dumb poor to a high-tech \"Indian reservation.\" And how could this be prevented? Rather than provide answers requiring original thought, the authors fade off into a nostalgic paean to old-fashioned, self-governing neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone looking for fresh, specific ideas about overhauling welfare -- and who isn't? -- will not find them in \"The Bell Curve.\" Instead there is padding: enough equivocating disclaimers for another \"Hamlet,\" and a mother lode of graphs designed to lend the book an air of unimpeachable authority, much as all those radar maps impart meteorological gravity to Willard Scott.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the authors concede their bell curves can be ignored. Lest they lose a single low-I.Q. customer, they announce in a revealingly caste-obsessed preface that their book is \"only about 30 pages long\" if read \"at the simplest level,\" since there are italicized Cliffs Notes throughout. The graph-packed main text is \"accessible to anyone who enjoys reading, for example, the science section of the news magazines,\" but the appendices that follow are suitable for only the very smartest -- no doubt the Asians who perform highest on I.Q. tests.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such clever merchandising may make \"The Bell Curve\" the best-selling unread book since the last novel by Umberto Eco. Then again, Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein may have outsmarted themselves. A book that blames low I.Q.'s for what ails America may have tough sledding in a culture where even conservatives have been rushing to deify the 75 I.Q. of Forrest Gump.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 52s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1750369183.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>How Trump does it (Posted 2015-12-21 02:11:42)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to what I've called \"the politics of self-esteem.\" By this, I mean that increasing numbers of people, on both the right and left, and most with good intentions, have become politically engaged because it makes them feel better. It raises their self-esteem. This phenomenon predates Donald Trump's candidacy, but it helps explain a Trump puzzle that baffles many observers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, the puzzle is familiar. Trump repeatedly says things that seem (by conventional wisdom) hateful, offensive, stupid or simply wrong. But instead of these apparent missteps backfiring -- sowing doubt about his competence and moral values -- just the opposite happens. The more Trump flouts prevailing norms, the more popular he becomes among Republicans. The latest example: After proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which was widely criticized, his support among Republicans jumped to 38 percent in December from 32 percent in November, according to a Washington Post-ABC News survey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has not redefined politics, but he has exploited a fundamental change of recent decades. Since World War II, much of national politics has involved a struggle for economic benefits. In 1940, the government transferred about 7 percent of national income from some groups to others. Now, that share is nearly 20 percent. This remains a huge part of politics, as debates over highway spending, farm subsidies, taxes and so much more remind us. But spending decisions are incremental; sweeping shifts are unlikely. We're not going to abolish Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against this backdrop, politics is increasingly shaped by issues that are cast in moral terms: abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay rights, global warming, guns, immigration and health care -- to name a few. Compared with most economic matters, these issues are much more combustible politically. On many economic questions, you can negotiate compromises that please, or displease, almost everyone equally. There's room for give-and-take. By contrast, compromises on moral questions are usually hard and often impossible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people who support these various moral crusades -- again, right and left -- are generally sincere. Liberals pledge to save the planet; conservatives vow to end illegal immigration. But their very passion suggests that they feel morally superior to their opponents and crave anything that strengthens their sense of superiority. They receive what I call \"psychic benefits,\" just as Social Security beneficiaries receive economic benefits. Significantly, these psychic benefits do not require the enactment of legislative agendas. Anything that makes your side look good or the other side look bad will suffice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What his supporters most like about Trump, even if they disagree with some of his policies (as some inevitably do), is that he defines himself -- he does not let others do it for him, and this rubs off on them. It's liberating. As he asserts his moral superiority over the judgments of the \"political establishment\" and \"mainstream media,\" so can his supporters defy others' hostile judgments of their values. In the contest for the high moral ground, they have a champion and a spokesman. They feel better about themselves. These are the psychic benefits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the \"political establishment\" and \"mainstream media\" -- admittedly ambiguous groups -- this poses a dilemma. When Trump makes proposals that strike them as simplistic, unworkable, undesirable or, worse, racist, they have two choices, both bad. If they decide not to react, their silence may seem to condone policies that they abhor. The second choice is to denounce many of Trump's ideas, but this plays into his hands because the more he is attacked by despised outsiders, the more popular and admired he becomes among supporters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What results is a bizarre, though fascinating, spectacle. Trump proposes. His opponents (pundits, politicians, \"experts\") pounce -- criticizing and fulminating. And Trump's popularity rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not inevitable that this cycle continue indefinitely. Trump may stumble. Some other candidate -- or candidates -- may soar. The avalanche of criticism may reach a critical mass, raising fresh doubts among some followers. Or Trump's outsize ego may begin to offend onetime allies. Politics is a fickle business. Still, Trump's success has so far stunned many veteran reporters and election observers who have underestimated his political skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more durable lesson here concerns the politics of self-esteem. Our system of governance is increasingly infused with a sanctimony all along the ideological spectrum that makes political accommodation and compromise harder to achieve. Well-intentioned people often act in rigid ways that maximize their self-esteem while perversely making it harder for the country to govern itself.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}

Funded by the Joyce Foundation, Chicago-based Boeing Co. and The Chicago Community Trust, the program, called IMPACT, ended in December after 13 of the city's 25 largest institutions agreed to consider nominees from outside \"the usual suspects\" -- not from their immediate social network, said Peter Kuntz, the executive director of the Arts & Business Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many of the city's civic boards relied on a very small number of minority leaders who were well known by the establishment -- Valerie Jarrett, Desiree Rogers, Tina Tchen,\" said Adele Simmons, the former president of the MacArthur Foundation. \"When they went to Washington (to serve in the Obama administration), they left a lot of vacancies.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz said that these large institutions frequently reported, \"We just don't know how to find these people.\" Searching for \"a whole new group hiding in plain sight,\" Kuntz says, takes time. Furthermore, white men dominate corporate board rooms, which are the most fruitful recruiting ground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A dream board is to have the CEO of every large corporation in Chicago,\" said Maureen Smith, one of the city's most active philanthropists. \"Because what we want are people with such seniority in their company that they can make a giving decision on their own, and don't have to ask someone up the ladder.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the IMPACT candidates were required to meet annual giving requirements, which ranged from $3,000 to $25,000. But it is never that simple, insiders say. Is there an unspoken, higher standard? Some minorities have departed boards, bitterly, after organizations abruptly enforced what previously were flexible standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid such conflicts, Ellen Alberding, the CEO of the Joyce Foundation, turned to Tribbett. Tribbett, who is black, says that \"seasoned\" minorities like himself -- he serves on at least four civic boards -- \"are all almost tapped out. There is a need for a new generation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tribbett agreed to take on the project pro bono and assigned one of his employees, Lyndon Taylor, to help oversee the process. Taylor ultimately became a participant in the program, joining the board of Hubbard Street Dance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Everyone we placed was a peer,\" Taylor said. \"There was no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz justifies spending a large amount of money to find nine people by saying that he expects a snowball effect. These nine will be able to recruit more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the search began, the Arts & Business Council spent a year trying to persuade the institutions to join the program. More than half declined. Some said they were doing fine on their own; others didn't have any board openings. The recession forced a handful of recruits to withdraw, but of those who remained, all were voted onto six boards. The group includes seven blacks, one Hispanic and one Native American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I kind of worked under the operating sense that Russell Reynolds and others wouldn't go to all this effort if we just looked at it as sort of a shopping list and said, 'Eh, I don't think so,' \" said Charles Katzenmeyer, vice president for external affairs at the Adler Planetarium, which added Kathy Hannan, a national managing partner at KPMG, and Lockett to its board through the program. \"As for fundraising, it can't be ignored because that person turns into a token.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Melissa Harris, who wishes diversity didn't need a special program, can be reached at mmharris@tribune.com or 312-222-4582.

Historically, it celebrates a lone Mexican victory in a war that Mexico lost: On May 5, 1862, in Puebla, Mexico, an indigent indigenous force under Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza (who was born in Texas when that state was part of Mexico) defeated a French expeditionary force, at that time part of the most powerful army in the world.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, Cinco de Mayo has become a colorful springtime fiesta that is fast spreading throughout the country with all the commercial trimmings of other U.S. holidays.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, in light of Mexico's financial and political agonies, the anti-immigration Proposition 187 and the anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> initiative, it's ironic or painful to be celebrating a Mexican holiday.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, it should serve to jog our memories of how close we are to Mexico. From San Ysidro on the border to Santa Rosa in the north, from Santa Cruz on the coast to San Bernardino in the desert, California claims 57 towns and cities named after santos. To paraphrase a popular aphorism: Poor California, with so many santos and so far from God! Gov. Wilson would probably add, \"And so close to Mexico.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California is my adopted state, by virtue of a mixed marriage. I'm from Texas, she's from California. This remarkable state has grown on me the way I outgrew Texas, years layered one over the other. I now admit a love for California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Texas, it was a love-hate relationship. Relations between Texans and Texanos were pitched with overt racism, not the subtle style I found here 20 years ago.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, Proposition 187 and the anti-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> initiative make me feel like I'm right back in Texas. There's a vigilante mood here not unlike that of a century ago. Even Texans are surprised at California's vehemence and, being more experienced, are wooing Mexican business away from Califas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, my attachment to California is so strong that I feel magnetized. I feel it through a melancholic sadness, an enchanting nostalgia for the California that has always been there, through the cities and towns named after spiritual ghosts, through the floods, earthquakes, fires and riots.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a mysterious energy that drives California to lead the nation in spiritual and temporal fashions, in sensational crimes, lifestyles, inventions and discoveries. Some believe it is the massive fields of energy from the ocean, from the deep blue sky or the energy that seeps up through the faults in the earth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My California dreams began in the late 1940s in west Texas. Our home was on a street that turned into the highway that led beyond the New Mexico sunsets. We were always waving goodby to family friends and their kids, piled into ancient cars on their way to the golden state of opportunity, to California. A year or two later, some would return from California to culture-shock us. I had never seen Mexican women in hip-hugging pedal-pushers. The kids no longer spoke Spanish. The men showed off their late-model station wagons boasting California license plates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California was the coolest. During the '50s, a time of adolescent innocence, everything from California was cool.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Texas, you could spot a California short-sleeve shirt a block away by the color and design. \"California threads?\" we would ask any proud vato wearing a snappy camisa. We would rub the cloth between our fingers. From there, our fingers would walk up to the shirt pocket, pull out a cigarette from his pack, and say \"Nice shirt, man! California?\" It became a way to bum cigarettes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Texanos had always identified as Mexicanos, Mexican Americans; in the barrios and the military, it was always Chicanos. When the Chicano movement exploded in California, many of us ridiculed those psuedo-\"Dons\" with dark Indian faces asserting their \"Spanish\" heritage. But it wasn't long before I was swept by the crusading likes of modern Californios such as Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Ernesto Galarza, Ignacio Lopez, Luisa Moreno and Bert Corona. Other crusaders came along: Vilma Martinez, Antonia Hernandez, Herman Gallegos, Alurista and Jose Montoya, farm workers, attorneys, union activists, artists, poets-all migrants and immigrants, not one of these leaders born in California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They reckoned this had to be their land after working its soil. They had grown to love the campos and the towns named after the santos their mothers and grandmothers lit votive candles and prayed to when their children migrated to California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now it's ours. We are Californians. And in this state that would rank as the third-most-populated Spanish-speaking country in the world, we can say, proudly and happily, Viva el Cinco de Mayo!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: JOSE ANTONIO BURCIAGA</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jose Antonio Burciaga is a Northern California writer, the author of \"Drink Cultura\" and \"Spilling the Beans,\" to be published in June by Joshua Odell Editions, Santa Barbara.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat In Favor": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}

We hunger for purpose at a moment when faith, patriotism and hard work are on the decline. We embrace secular religions like climatism, Covidism and gender ideology to satisfy our need for meaning, yet we can't answer what it means to be an American.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican Party's top priority should be to fill this void with an inspiring national identity that dilutes the woke agenda to irrelevance. Instead, many top Republicans recite slogans they memorized in 1980 or criticize left-wing culture without offering an alternative. To put America first, we need to rediscover what America is. That's why I am running for president. I am launching not only a political campaign but a cultural movement to create a new American Dream -- one that is not only about money but about the unapologetic pursuit of excellence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may seem presumptuous for a 37-year-old political outsider to pursue the highest office in the land, but I am running on a vision for our nation -- one that revives merit in every sphere of American life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit for who gets to come to America. My parents entered this country legally, worked hard and raised two kids who went on to create businesses that improved the lives of thousands of Americans. We need more immigrants like them, instead of those who break the law when they enter our country. That means securing the border unapologetically and eliminating lottery-based immigration in favor of meritocratic admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must embrace merit in who gets to succeed in America. The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn racial preferences in college admissions. As president I will eliminate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> across the American economy. Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 mandates that federal contractors -- which employ approximately 20% of the U.S. workforce -- adopt race-based hiring preferences. Top companies now regularly disfavor qualified applicants who happen to be white or Asian-American, which spawns resentment and condescension toward black and Hispanic hires. I will rescind this executive order and direct the Justice Department to prosecute illegal race-based preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must revive merit in who gets to govern in America. Democracy depends on a simple principle: The people we elect to run the government must be the people who actually run the government. The next time unelected bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci or Merrick Garland reach beyond their legal scope, I commit to doing what the president is constitutionally empowered to do: fire them. I will repeal civil-service protections for federal employees, by executive order if necessary, and replace these managerial protections with sunset clauses. If the president can't hold his position for more than eight years, neither should most bureaucrats. I will call on Congress to repeal or amend the 1974 Impoundment Control Act and will stop funding agencies that waste money or have outlived their purpose. I will shut down agencies that can't be reformed and create new ones built from scratch to replace them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must restore merit in determining which ideas win in America. The best ideas are born when no ideas are censored. Yet our government pressures technology companies to censor disfavored political speech and gives them special protections to carry it out. Internet companies are bound by the First Amendment when they act in concert with state actors. As Elon Musk did at Twitter, I will release the \"state action files\" from the federal government -- publicly exposing every known instance in which bureaucrats have wrongfully pressured companies to take constitutionally prohibited actions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Viewpoint censorship extends beyond the internet and pervades our economy. If you can't fire someone for being black, gay or Muslim, you shouldn't be able to fire someone for his political speech. I will work with Congress to enshrine political expression as an American civil right, and I will enforce existing civil-rights laws to protect workers from invidious viewpoint discrimination. The federal prohibition on religious discrimination forbids employers from forcing employees to bow down to any religion, including secular ones as defined by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Seeger (1965) and Torcaso v. Watkins (1961). The modern woke agenda in much of corporate America fits that bill.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once we revive our national identity around shared principles, we can muster the fortitude needed to defeat the greatest external threat to America: the rise of communist China. Unlike the Soviet Union in 1980, China today powers the modern American way of life. We must declare economic independence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must reclaim global energy leadership by rejecting the demands of a new climate religion that shackles the U.S. and leaves China untouched. We must achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency while vigorously protecting Taiwan. We should prohibit kids under 16 from using TikTok. We must use financial levers to hold China accountable for spawning the Covid-19 pandemic. We must even be willing to bar U.S. companies from expanding into China until its government abandons theft and other mercantilist tactics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can rise to this occasion if we rediscover who we really are. America's strength isn't our diversity but the ideals that unify us across our differences. These ideals won the American Revolution, reunited us after the Civil War, won two World Wars and the Cold War. They still give hope to the free world. If we can revive them, nothing will defeat us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ramaswamy is a co-founder of Strive Asset Management and author, most recently, of \"Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence\" and \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Ramaswamy for President?

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409108213.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Two Little Words: (1) Advice, (2) Consent</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives believe that every word of the Constitution should be \"strictly construed\" according to its \"plain meaning\" and the \"original intent\" of the men who wrote it. Every word, that is, except two: \"advice\" and \"consent.\" The plain meaning of these words is not hard to fathom, nor is their authors' intent. Senatorial \"advice and consent\" on the president's judicial nominations was a compromise between those who thought the president should appoint judges and those who thought Congress should do it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least when the White House is Republican and the Senate is Democratic, however, conservatives discover all sorts of doctrines in the word \"consent\" that are far from clear to the naked eye. Senators musn't consider the nominee's ideology. They must never ask or consider how the nominee might vote on specific issues or cases. As for the word \"advice,\" fuggedabadit. At Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Tuesday about standards for approving judicial nominations, all the energy on the conservative side was about piling limitations on the Senate's power of consent. Only a liberal suggested that maybe the Constitution is trying to tell us that presidents should seek the Senate's advice in choosing his nominees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's straighten out a few concepts here. Ideology can mean the sum of your views on all political issues: welfare, taxes, trade with China, etc. Yes, of course, senators should not consider a would-be judge's politics -- except to ensure as best they can that the judge won't consider them either in his or her rulings. But ideology can also mean your specific philosophy on judicial matters: the role of precedent, the meaning of the 14th Amendment, and so on. And senators of course can and should inquire about this kind of ideology and vote yea or nea on that basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives generally accept this distinction. But they muddle it by presenting their own preferred judicial ideology -- a flurry of bromidic phrases: \"judicial restraint,\" \"strict construction,\" \"original intent\" -- as a piety beyond legitimate dispute. So any liberal challenge to a conservative nominee is automatically \"ideological\" in the bad sense, while every conservative challenge to a liberal nominee is based on philosophical principle.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The conservatives' judicial philosophy is not beyond legitimate dispute. First of all, they themselves happily overlook it when it is inconvenient. \"Advice and consent\" is a ripe example. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span> is another: Conservatives want judges to use the Constitution to overturn policies of the elected branches. They sincerely believe, no doubt, that this is a case where the Constitution speaks clearly and judicial restraint is inappropriate. But that's the point: Their buzzwords don't provide an unfailing guide even for them, let alone a beacon of truth so bright that the path it illuminates is the only one worth taking. Waving a wand called \"strict construction\" can't fully illuminate purposely vague phrases like \"cruel and unusual.\" Invoking \"original intent\" won't tell you what the authors' original intent was about dealing with changing circumstances.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If \"advice and consent\" is entitled to anything close to its plain, original meaning, the Senate is perfectly entitled to scrutinize nominees' judicial philosophies and to reject some on that basis. Scrutiny includes asking nominees their views and their reasoning about fairly specific legal issues, if not actual pending cases. Why not? After all, sitting judges write long opinions day after day telling us what they think about many issues that will come up again, but no one regards that as a problem.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Needless to say, it would be wrong for Senate Democrats to let considerations of sauce for the gander influence their thinking on this issue. President Bush would never let political considerations influence his judicial choices. When he campaigned last fall on a promise to nominate justices like Scalia and Thomas, he must have had in mind some other way in which those two gentlemen are alike.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for eight years of Republican harassment and blocking of President Clinton's nominees, Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed at Tuesday's hearing that this is entirely a figment of your imagination. That's right -- it never happened! His \"proof\": almost as many Clinton nominees as Reagan nominees ultimately got confirmed. Of course this says nothing one way or another about how many were blocked and had to be replaced.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clint Bolick, director of legal affairs for the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy and head of the so-called Institute for Justice, also testified on Tuesday. Bolick noted that his organization didn't oppose any of Clinton's Supreme Court nominees. He did not mention his ferocious campaign against Bill Lann Lee, Clinton's nominee for head of civil rights at the Justice Department. Ordinarily, a president's choices for his own administration are thought to deserve more deference, not less, than his nominations for lifetime appointments to the independent judiciary. But an Institute of Justice press release at the time (1997 again) argued that the advice and consent clause actually obliges senators to oppose nominees with erroneous views \"when the stakes are high enough.\" The stakes in this case were in essence that Bolick's group favored judicial activism -- judges overthrowing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> plans -- and Lee did not.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Institute of Justice Web site describes it as dedicated to opposing \"racial preferences\" and \"the welfare state\" and as a \"courtroom champion\" for \"free market solutions and limited government.\" But Bolick testified Tuesday that \"mere philosophical differences\" shouldn't play a role in the Senate's approval of judges -- and, what's more, they never had. To start now would be \"a sea change,\" he said. Bolick quoted Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy in 1997 denouncing the practice of \"blue slipping\" -- individual senators blocking judicial nominees from their state. He didn't explain why Leahy should be so upset about something that didn't exist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate (www.slate.com), writes a weekly column for The Post.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}

Once a certain threshold is achieved, for much of their history colleges gave \u201cextra points\u201d to certain students, because their family members were alums, because a student excelled at a niche sport, because their wealthy parents made a significant donation or because they hailed from an underrepresented state.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact that these legacies, scions, athletes and geographic admissions were almost always of the same race and similar socioeconomic classes was deemed unremarkable. In the late 1960s, in pursuit of a more diverse higher education experience, and to redress prior unexamined biases, schools began shifting some of these extra points toward students of color and students who were economically disadvantaged. Occasionally, students who excelled in tiny towns or at different sports were recognized.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For generations a wide array of students has benefited from \u201c<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\u201d Yet today, for some reason, it\u2019s only the black and brown students who get labeled as such.

What's the ABA doing supporting abortion rights, endorsing <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and now calling for a death penalty moratorium? Congressman Chris Cox wrote a trenchant article for the Weekly Standard recently exposing in detail how the ABA's liberal agenda skews its evaluations of judicial nominees. But another area where the nation's largest organization of lawyers has gone off the tracks hasn't gotten nearly enough attention -- the ABA is actively promoting an anti-business agenda.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same meeting earlier this month where the ABA adopted the anti-death penalty plank, its House of Delegates also endorsed a resolution on class actions. The resolution favors making it easier to certify class actions for settlement purposes, and opposes a proposal to rein in \"coupon\" settlements unless the \"litigation's probable deterrence value\" is taken into account. In other words the ABA thinks the public is being well-served by settlements -- such as those in the notorious Ford Bronco II and airline price-fixing cases -- where the plaintiffs' lawyers reap millions while their ostensible clients collect coupons worth almost nothing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nobody should be surprised, since the ABA has a long record of opposing any effort to improve the tort system. According to a summary compiled by the Federalist Society, the ABA opposes a loser pays rule; opposes any limits on pain and suffering awards; opposes a \"ceiling\" on medical malpractice damages; and opposes product liability reform. In effect, then, the ABA wants to let plaintiffs' lawyers continue extorting billions from American companies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As if to add insult to (personal) injury, the ABA has also gone on record  favoring a long list of government mandates on business: universal health care, protection from discrimination for HIV patients, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the like. The group has even called for the creation of \"a federal agency to advocate the views of consumers,\" a long-standing Naderite pipe dream. Is there any pro-business idea that finds favor with the pooh-bahs of the ABA? Oh yes, there is one: The ABA supported Nafta.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ABA resolutions aren't just empty words. The ABA has a corps of paid lobbyists who are authorized to support the stances taken by its House of Delegates. And these lobbyists were active in opposing Republican efforts to pass civil justice reform as part of the \"Contract with America.\" Who can forget the ABA president describing the new GOP Congressional majority in 1995 as \"reptilian bastards.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some will no doubt say: Well what do you expect from a bunch of lawyers? They want to preserve their honey pot, so they don't want to change the tort system. A realistic, if cynical, assessment. But the ABA itself claims that it's not merely a special pleader for lawyers; after all, it somehow finds the moral authority to instruct the rest of America on how to run foreign and social policy. The group even has a quasi-governmental function: It certifies lawyers and law schools, and regulates their conduct. The ABA also formally advises the President and Senate on judicial nominations. By backing the plaintiffs' bar, the ABA is not only casting doubt on its ability to carry out these functions fairly and impartially, but it's also sticking it to a large portion of its membership: lawyers who work for businesses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bunch of Fortune 500 general counsels were sufficiently alarmed about the ABA's drift that they convened a summit meeting last year with the organization's leaders. The powwow didn't accomplish much. The ABA, for instance, still refuses to adopt a proposal limiting contingency fees endorsed by heavyweights ranging from Robert Bork to Robert Pitofsky. This group wants the ABA, which already bars \"unreasonable\" fees, to stipulate that it's unethical for a lawyer to take one-third of a plaintiff's award if the case was so simple that he didn't have to do much work or take much risk. No dice. Apparently the ABA is more interested in opposing nuclear weapons than contingency fees, which happen to be the engine driving much of the liability explosion of recent decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But then the ABA doesn't believe there is a liability explosion. Not long ago, the group put out a lengthy pamphlet of \"Facts About the Civil Justice System,\" which claims there hasn't been an increase in personal injury suits. As evidence, the pamphlet points out that tort litigation has slightly decreased since 1990. The brochure doesn't bother to mention another fact: tort filings have increased dramatically since 1984.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such selective use of evidence reveals the ABA's deep and abiding bias in favor of runaway litigation. Given that slant, it's hard for us to see why anybody should take seriously the ABA's opinions on judges or any other subject.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: ABA's Solid Stand On Business Issues\" -- WSJ March 19, 1997)</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 47s "}}
