{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/408523809.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Goodbye Pork Rinds, Hello Penthouse</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the day last month when Vice President Gore formally announced his presidential campaign, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson gave reporters a tour of what he called the real Gore homestead: the penthouse suite of a luxury Washington hotel.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nicholson's stunt was clever. It was also outdated--better suited to an era of politics that is receding rapidly into the past. In 2000, Gore should not have to worry much about disguising his establishment credentials and upbringing; neither should Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who probably enjoys pork rinds no more than his father did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both these front-runners are superbly well-positioned to benefit from one of the realities of Clinton-era politics: the triumph of the elites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The messiness of Bill Clinton's personal life, and the anger he elicits from opponents, have helped obscure one of his principal legacies: He closed a three-decade chapter during which populism-- fueled by the grievances of average citizens toward establishment institutions and establishment values--was a dominant force in American politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the late 1960s, nearly all important political movements have drawn their power from this source. Liberals succeeded in mobilizing voters in a wave of populist grievance against the establishment's prosecution of the Vietnam War. But most populist causes were distinctly conservative in origin: anger at courts for promoting racial preferences and inventing a right to abortion; anger at politicians for high taxes and lenient crime and welfare policies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The early machinations of 2000 politics highlight vividly how these movements have been drained of energy during the Clinton years. Polls show the tax-cutting issue spinning with none of its old traction, to the frustration of many GOP lawmakers. Tolerance, meanwhile, has replaced grievance as the new ethos of national politics--as shown by the efforts of presidential candidates like Bush and Elizabeth Dole to mute traditional Republican opposition to abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And look what happened to the most recent populist sensation to roil national politics: term limits. Many of the throw-the-bums-out candidates elected to Congress on three-term pledges in 1994 are now busy concocting rationales for sticking around after all.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Populism has been dethroned by a directly opposite phenomenon: a rough national consensus that the people who are running America, in the national government and in other public institutions, may actually be doing an acceptable job.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Who are the elites of the Clinton era? In the most literal sense, they are the collection of investment bankers, moderately progressive policy experts and political consultants who run this administration day to day. More broadly, they are the community of liberal special- interest advocates, lawyers and foreign policy interventionists whose political values--based on the premise that an educated cadre of experts generally knows what's best for the country--have gained primacy in national life in recent years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is irony here. Clinton first ran for president with a campaign that saw itself as a populist cause. His advisers dressed in denim. His mission was to evict a president allegedly oblivious to the concerns of ordinary voters. Yet after six and a half years in office, the Man from Hope (who was also the Man from Yale Law School) has made American politics safe for Volvo drivers and pointy heads of all stripes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No sensible politician, of course, would choose to present himself or herself to voters next year as the candidate of the elite. But plenty of these politicians are supporting--or at least trying to reconcile their views with--the elite premises that are shaping this year's politics. That's because many of these premises now have clear majority support. Just look at two issues that have dominated Washington's agenda since the end of Clinton's impeachment trial in February: gun control and Kosovo.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gun control and foreign interventionism are both elite enthusiasms of long-standing. And both ideas run against the grain of even older populist traditions. Indeed, both are capable of exciting intense antagonism among people who think elites have no business interfering with gun ownership or risking American lives and treasure abroad except when national interests are directly threatened.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet congressional Democrats, many of whom were punished by voters for gun-control votes in 1994, are pushing the issue anew--secure in the knowledge that it now enjoys overwhelming majority support, even in many conservative districts. Clinton's Kosovo intervention, likewise, enjoyed majority support--even though it was a humanitarian mission in a place most Americans had never heard of before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Budget policy, the other issue that will dominate Washington's attention this year, illustrates how Clinton himself is tugged by competing populist and elitist impulses. In 1993, he famously complained to his staff that they had become virtual \"Eisenhower Republicans,\" as he had to give up the domestic spending he wanted in order to convince Wall Street he was doing enough to lower the deficit. Six years later, he regards the elimination of that deficit as a paramount achievement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several reasons for populism's rout. The most important may be the most obvious: the surging U.S. economy. So much money is being made that nearly everyone is reaping the benefits. The preoccupation of 2000 politics will be keeping the golden goose on her nest.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A vivid sign that the Age of Elites is upon us came earlier this year when Time magazine ran an idolizing cover story on the \"Committee to Save the World.\" The supposed saviors were Alan Greenspan, the unelected Federal Reserve chairman; then-Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street tycoon; and his successor, Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But a soaring Dow is only one manifestation of a larger trend. Crime is down. So are most indexes of poverty. The federal government has tamed its chronic budget deficits. The U.S. military has performed with impressive competence in wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By no means is Bill Clinton responsible for all or even most of this good news, but it is no surprise that he should be the beneficiary of it. Decades of ostentatious failures--from Vietnam to Watergate to a series of recessions--were quite naturally going to produce populist backlash. Success, on the other hand, empowers elites: The Gallup organization reports 55 percent of the country is \"satisfied\" with the direction of the country, compared with just 14 percent seven years ago this month.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The defeat of populism also reflects a deliberate political strategy of the Clinton White House. With actions ranging from his signing of a GOP-drafted welfare reform bill in 1996 to his consistent focus on anti-crime measures, Clinton has co-opted issues that Republicans for decades used effectively to tap populist resentment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That strategy has been aided by a powerful tool that Clinton uses more aggressively than virtually any other politician: polling. No previous White House has integrated polling so thoroughly into the policy-making process as this one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At first blush, obsessive polling of the public seems like the most populist politics of all. The paradox, however, is that polling can actually help defeat populist fervors by letting elites know precisely how to accommodate them in the most surgical way possible. Clinton's careful positioning on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>--\"mend it, don't end it\"--is one example.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax cuts are another. No doubt Clinton the Wonk would prefer that the government keep all the money it can. Clinton the Politician, however, knows acutely the dangers of ignoring the popularity of tax cuts. In 1996, he and then-consultant Dick Morris used polling to create a strategy of targeted tax deductions and credits, used to subsidize education and other favored goals. Genuine tax-cut proponents correctly identify the elitist premise of this approach: Why should the government be directing the ways you can spend your own money? To their frustration, however, these critics have seen Clinton's maneuvering deplete the tax issue of its potency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, even Clinton's sex scandal ended up as a ratification of elite values. For decades, going back to FDR's time, it had been a populist theme that the people running Washington were secretly libertines and hypocrites. Then last year came proof that at least some of those suspicions were true. The public responded, not with populist moralism, but with cosmopolitan tolerance about weaknesses of the flesh.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Polls suggest that many people, exhausted by seven years of the Clinton psychodrama, are ready to see him go. But the anti-populist brand of politics he represents stays behind. If Gore and Bush retain their front-runner status, next year's presidential race will feature two charmed children of the establishment, however much they drape themselves in down-home airs. (That statement would be equally true of Bill Bradley and Elizabeth Dole.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore, who graduated from Harvard in 1969 and is the son of a senator, hopes to be nominated in an unusually orderly process as the chosen candidate of his party's elite. Bush, who graduated from Yale in 1968 and is the son of a president, hopes to be nominated in an unusually orderly process as the chosen candidate of his party's elite. Gore preaches centrism and tolerance. Bush preaches centrism and compassion. If Gore gets elected, he will no doubt surround himself with moderately liberal veterans of Washington's policy establishment who will try above all not to let prosperity wane. If Bush gets elected, he will surround himself with moderately conservative veterans of Washington's policy establishment who will try above all not to let prosperity wane.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Either way, the era of pork-rind politics is over.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Harris covers the White House for The Washington Post.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 48s "}}
{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_2", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/421647247.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Commentary; UC Regents Inject Race Into Admissions, Yet Again</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With great fanfare the Board of Regents of the University of California has announced new admissions policies. These policies will downgrade academic qualifications (grades and test scores) and will include factors such as the students' athletic or artistic ability or struggle against poverty. The supporters of these changes say they will not use the new rules to promote raced-based admissions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real goal of the new guidelines is the elimination of the concepts of fairness and objectivity from the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is no accident that most colleges use the SAT and high school grades as the main criteria for admissions. These have been shown for decades to be the best predictors of scholastic performance. The SAT has the added advantage over grades in that everyone takes the same test and the test is scored the same way for everyone. The SAT is objective. It is blind to race, gender, age, politics, religion, national origin and sexual orientation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is precisely why the regents oppose it. They want the admissions process to be subjective. This means that hidden agendas can be brought into the admissions process.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe that the new guidelines will not be politicized? UC Berkeley is one of the most left-wing schools in the country. Ability aside, who is more likely to get admitted there under the new \"flexible\" guidelines--the high school radical who claims that the attack on the World Trade Center was our fault or the conservative student who supports our right to self-defense?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does anyone believe, despite explicit disclaimers to the contrary, that race will not be brought back as a factor in admissions?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May the regents voted to drop a 6-year-old ban on <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Because state law prohibits <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in public hiring and admissions, the regents clearly were sending a message by their vote.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new criteria will serve to protect the university system against discrimination charges by academically qualified students of the wrong race. Previously, students who were discriminated against because of race could show that they should have been admitted because their test scores and grades were better than those who were admitted. If they took the case to court, they usually won. Now the university can say, \"We used a holistic procedure based on numerous factors that vary from student to student, and we decided that student X had a special combination of qualities that we wanted and student Y did not.\" Such subjective guidelines offer a rejected student no chance of winning in a court of law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The regents claim that the new guidelines will allow the admission of people with athletic ability. Whom are they trying to fool? For better or for worse, good athletes have been given preference in admissions to colleges and universities for decades.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And how does a struggle against poverty, as admirable as that is, qualify one for college admission?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>UC President Richard C. Atkinson says that high school students can gain admittance if they work hard and take tough courses. But how can he promise such a thing if the new guidelines specifically de-emphasize academics? Under the new procedures, it is impossible for a student to know what to do to prepare for college. The new \"flexible\" criteria can be anything the admissions office wants. The ones to suffer the most will be precisely the intelligent, hard- working, high-achieving students who most deserve admission.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real motive for the new admissions criteria is egalitarianism. The regents cannot accept the fact that some people are more academically qualified than others so their solution is to undermine the concept of academic competence. If they succeed, both students and universities will be the worse for it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Edwin A.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1750369183.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>How Trump does it (Posted 2015-12-21 02:11:42)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Welcome to what I've called \"the politics of self-esteem.\" By this, I mean that increasing numbers of people, on both the right and left, and most with good intentions, have become politically engaged because it makes them feel better. It raises their self-esteem. This phenomenon predates Donald Trump's candidacy, but it helps explain a Trump puzzle that baffles many observers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, the puzzle is familiar. Trump repeatedly says things that seem (by conventional wisdom) hateful, offensive, stupid or simply wrong. But instead of these apparent missteps backfiring -- sowing doubt about his competence and moral values -- just the opposite happens. The more Trump flouts prevailing norms, the more popular he becomes among Republicans. The latest example: After proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the country, which was widely criticized, his support among Republicans jumped to 38 percent in December from 32 percent in November, according to a Washington Post-ABC News survey.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has not redefined politics, but he has exploited a fundamental change of recent decades. Since World War II, much of national politics has involved a struggle for economic benefits. In 1940, the government transferred about 7 percent of national income from some groups to others. Now, that share is nearly 20 percent. This remains a huge part of politics, as debates over highway spending, farm subsidies, taxes and so much more remind us. But spending decisions are incremental; sweeping shifts are unlikely. We're not going to abolish Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against this backdrop, politics is increasingly shaped by issues that are cast in moral terms: abortion, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, gay rights, global warming, guns, immigration and health care -- to name a few. Compared with most economic matters, these issues are much more combustible politically. On many economic questions, you can negotiate compromises that please, or displease, almost everyone equally. There's room for give-and-take. By contrast, compromises on moral questions are usually hard and often impossible.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The people who support these various moral crusades -- again, right and left -- are generally sincere. Liberals pledge to save the planet; conservatives vow to end illegal immigration. But their very passion suggests that they feel morally superior to their opponents and crave anything that strengthens their sense of superiority. They receive what I call \"psychic benefits,\" just as Social Security beneficiaries receive economic benefits. Significantly, these psychic benefits do not require the enactment of legislative agendas. Anything that makes your side look good or the other side look bad will suffice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What his supporters most like about Trump, even if they disagree with some of his policies (as some inevitably do), is that he defines himself -- he does not let others do it for him, and this rubs off on them. It's liberating. As he asserts his moral superiority over the judgments of the \"political establishment\" and \"mainstream media,\" so can his supporters defy others' hostile judgments of their values. In the contest for the high moral ground, they have a champion and a spokesman. They feel better about themselves. These are the psychic benefits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the \"political establishment\" and \"mainstream media\" -- admittedly ambiguous groups -- this poses a dilemma. When Trump makes proposals that strike them as simplistic, unworkable, undesirable or, worse, racist, they have two choices, both bad. If they decide not to react, their silence may seem to condone policies that they abhor. The second choice is to denounce many of Trump's ideas, but this plays into his hands because the more he is attacked by despised outsiders, the more popular and admired he becomes among supporters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What results is a bizarre, though fascinating, spectacle. Trump proposes. His opponents (pundits, politicians, \"experts\") pounce -- criticizing and fulminating. And Trump's popularity rises.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not inevitable that this cycle continue indefinitely. Trump may stumble. Some other candidate -- or candidates -- may soar. The avalanche of criticism may reach a critical mass, raising fresh doubts among some followers. Or Trump's outsize ego may begin to offend onetime allies. Politics is a fickle business. Still, Trump's success has so far stunned many veteran reporters and election observers who have underestimated his political skills.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The more durable lesson here concerns the politics of self-esteem. Our system of governance is increasingly infused with a sanctimony all along the ideological spectrum that makes political accommodation and compromise harder to achieve. Well-intentioned people often act in rigid ways that maximize their self-esteem while perversely making it harder for the country to govern itself.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Neutral": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 32s "}}

Lockett knew that's why Tribbett, a respected civic leader and executive at search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, was vetting her to join the board of one of the city's largest cultural institutions, and she had no qualms about it.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I thought it was wonderful, because when you look at the composition of board membership across our most treasured institutions, the diversity is abysmal,\" Lockett said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Chicago's nonprofits it's been an issue for a long time: How to recruit more (and different) minority representatives to boards when the pool of candidates who have the big job titles and wealth is still too small.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So for the last three years, about $400,000 has been spent placing nine highly qualified minorities, including Lockett, on the boards of Chicago's largest nonprofits. Funded by the Joyce Foundation, Chicago-based Boeing Co. and The Chicago Community Trust, the program, called IMPACT, ended in December after 13 of the city's 25 largest institutions agreed to consider nominees from outside \"the usual suspects\" -- not from their immediate social network, said Peter Kuntz, the executive director of the Arts & Business Council.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many of the city's civic boards relied on a very small number of minority leaders who were well known by the establishment -- Valerie Jarrett, Desiree Rogers, Tina Tchen,\" said Adele Simmons, the former president of the MacArthur Foundation. \"When they went to Washington (to serve in the Obama administration), they left a lot of vacancies.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz said that these large institutions frequently reported, \"We just don't know how to find these people.\" Searching for \"a whole new group hiding in plain sight,\" Kuntz says, takes time. Furthermore, white men dominate corporate board rooms, which are the most fruitful recruiting ground.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A dream board is to have the CEO of every large corporation in Chicago,\" said Maureen Smith, one of the city's most active philanthropists. \"Because what we want are people with such seniority in their company that they can make a giving decision on their own, and don't have to ask someone up the ladder.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of the IMPACT candidates were required to meet annual giving requirements, which ranged from $3,000 to $25,000. But it is never that simple, insiders say. Is there an unspoken, higher standard? Some minorities have departed boards, bitterly, after organizations abruptly enforced what previously were flexible standards.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid such conflicts, Ellen Alberding, the CEO of the Joyce Foundation, turned to Tribbett. Tribbett, who is black, says that \"seasoned\" minorities like himself -- he serves on at least four civic boards -- \"are all almost tapped out. There is a need for a new generation.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tribbett agreed to take on the project pro bono and assigned one of his employees, Lyndon Taylor, to help oversee the process. Taylor ultimately became a participant in the program, joining the board of Hubbard Street Dance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Everyone we placed was a peer,\" Taylor said. \"There was no <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kuntz justifies spending a large amount of money to find nine people by saying that he expects a snowball effect. These nine will be able to recruit more.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the search began, the Arts & Business Council spent a year trying to persuade the institutions to join the program.

Democrat Bill Clinton continues to appeal to about the same 43% of the electorate that voted for him in 1992. On the Republican side, Sens. Bob Dole and Phil Gramm are running hard, along with a roomful of hopefuls struggling for national recognition. But so far none of these candidacies is drawing many oohs and ahs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This lack of excitement about what the two major parties have to offer is not new to U.S. presidential politics; today as before, the disenchantment has something to do with the personalities of the candidates. But on a more fundamental level it reflects a darkening mood among Americans. The growing distrust of the professional political class, the frustration with the simplistic nostrums peddled by the ideological left and right alike, the feeling that the political procedure has gone awry--all have left many voters unhappy with both the governing process and the choices they sense will be presented next year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings us to Colin Powell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>LOOK OF A LEADER: The retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has begun a multi-city tour to promote his newly published memoirs. Inescapably, this commercial enterprise bodes to become indistinguishable from a national political progression. For at this stage in his life, Powell--articulate, intelligent, experienced in Washington politics and in global affairs, a true American success story--can accurately be called charismatic. Ready or not, he is about to become an object of the closest political scrutiny. In our current political culture, with its deficit of leadership, Powell has the look of a leader about him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He says he will make a decision on his future in the next few months. Only now is he beginning to outline his views on domestic issues. He prefers adoption to abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. A gun owner, he favors gun control. He supports some <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. He opposes mandatory prayer in the schools but supports moments of silence. All this seems to place him in the broad, moderate middle--not an ideal place for anyone hoping to get the nomination at the 1996 GOP convention. If Powell is truly thinking about presidential politics, that thinking may well lie outside the two-party system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TWO KEY FACTORS: The huge difficulty in running for the presidency without the support of a national party organization doesn't necessarily mean that such a campaign is impossible. Two things right now promote a Powell candidacy. The first is voter interest in having another choice, an alternative to what the two parties may offer. The other is the perceived strength of Powell's character.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's always possible the Powell bubble will burst in a few months.

He was still steamed about what an unforgivably lousy negotiator his president had been on the debt ceiling agreement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One particular Obama move he found appalling above all the rest. \u201cThere is a provision in our Constitution that speaks to making sure that the United States meets its obligations,\u201d the president had said, referring to Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, \u201cand there have been some suggestions\u201d \u2014 by Bill Clinton and various legal scholars \u2014 \u201cthat a president could use that language to basically ignore that debt ceiling rule.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my Hollywood supernegotiator friend, Obama should\u2019ve stopped right there \u2014 or, even better, followed up with that standard ambiguous saber-rattling line: \u201cNo option is off the table.\u201d Raising the possibility of unilateral executive action would\u2019ve strengthened his hand against the Republicans. Instead, Mr. Transparent and Reasonable instantly ruled it out in the weakest way possible: \u201cI have talked to my lawyers. They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My friend recited the president\u2019s surrender sentence incredulously, slipping an obscene seven-letter gerund in front of lawyers. Since the Republicans were threatening to go nuclear in unprecedented fashion, why didn\u2019t the president at least threaten to use his unprecedented nuclear option to stop them?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, it\u2019s a pity Barack Obama isn\u2019t more like Richard Nixon. I think of Nixon every year around now, as another anniversary of his resignation (Tuesday the 9th) rolls around. President Nixon famously tried convincing the Communists that he might literally go nuclear if they didn\u2019t behave. \u201cI call it the Madman Theory,\u201d he explained to his chief of staff. \u201cI want the North Vietnamese to believe that I\u2019ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, a lot of us swooned over Obama partly because he seemed so prudent, straightforward and even-keeled. But now, with Republicans spectacularly applying the Madman Theory for the first time in domestic politics, Obama\u2019s nonconfrontational reasonableness isn\u2019t looking like such a virtue.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s frustrating. We\u2019ve had presidents who were intelligent and progressive but also cynical and ruthless when necessary. Effective, tough-minded, visionary liberals such as F.D.R., Clinton ... and Nixon.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In popular imagination, Nixon remains nothing but a great goblin \u2014 scowling bomber of Southeast Asia, panderer to fear and racism, paranoid anti-Semite, dispatcher of burglars \u2014 but the truth is, he governed further to the left than any president who followed him. The overreaching Euro-socialist nanny state that today\u2019s Republicans despise? That blossomed in the Nixon administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Spending on social services doubled, and military budgets actually decreased. He oversaw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. His administration was the first to encourage and enable American Indian tribal autonomy. He quadrupled the staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, almost tripled federal outlays for civil rights and began <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in federal hiring. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment and signed Title IX, the law granting equality to female student athletes. One of his Supreme Court appointees wrote the Roe v. Wade decision.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nixon made Social Security cost-of-living increases automatic, expanded food stamps and started Supplemental Security Income for the disabled and elderly poor. It helped, of course, that Democrats controlled the House and Senate. But it was the president, not Congress, who proposed a universal health insurance plan and a transformation of welfare that would have set a guaranteed minimum income and allowed men to remain with their welfare-recipient families. It was Nixon who radically intervened in the free market by imposing wage and price controls, launched d\u00e9tente with the Soviets, normalized relations with Mao\u2019s China and let the Communists win in Vietnam.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, for good measure,\u00a0the\u00a0budget for the National Endowment for the Arts grew sixfold, by far the biggest increase by any president.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of Nixon \u2014 Nixon?  \u2014 as a de facto liberal provokes cognitive dissonance, especially among people over 50. Facts notwithstanding, they refuse to buy it, as if they\u2019ve been fooled by a parlor trick. But the only trick involved is judging Nixon circa 1970 by the ideological standards of 2011.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My late mother, who voted for every Republican presidential candidate from Wendell Willkie through George H.W.

Nothing they say shocks me anymore.\u201d She voted five times for Nixon, whose Madman Theory was a tactical posturing to make the Communists think he was an unhinged, reckless fanatic itching to wreak havoc.

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1652232593.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>The Best Way to Address Campus Rape</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE campus rape debate took another hairpin turn last week when The Daily Beast published an interview with Paul Nungesser, the Columbia student accused of raping a fellow student, Emma Sulkowicz. She has been carrying a mattress around the campus to raise awareness about sexual assault and to protest the school's failure to expel Mr. Nungesser, who was cleared by a campus tribunal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The article raised questions about her story; among other things, it included screen shots from Mr. Nungesser's Facebook account showing that he and Ms. Sulkowicz had traded mutually affectionate messages for weeks after the incident in question.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response, the Columbia Daily Spectator published two columns wondering whether the paper had been too quick to assume Mr. Nungesser's guilt. Ms. Sulkowicz's supporters and some bloggers denounced The Daily Beast for conducting a trial by media and for posting the Facebook pages, which they said added nothing to the story unless you believed that a rape survivor who didn't behave like the perfect victim had to be a liar.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the media has reason to retry the case. Ms. Sulkowicz herself sought out the media when Columbia exonerated Mr. Nungesser. And the media made Ms. Sulkowicz so well known as a rape survivor that Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, invited her to the State of the Union address and publicly declared that she had received \"no justice.\" Very few people, and almost no one in the media, thought to question that assertion, because everyone knows, just knows, that you can't trust a campus sexual assault proceeding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What explains the nearly universal lack of confidence in these proceedings? Universities share some of the blame, but there's another culprit too: the United States government. People often wonder why college administrators try to adjudicate these fiendishly difficult cases, rather than putting them in the hands of the criminal justice system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason is that the Department of Education has very forcefully told schools to handle sexual grievances themselves and given them very detailed instructions about how to do so. A report last year from a White House task force on campus sexual assault underscored the importance to a university of following that advice. Even though the D.O.E.'s instructions are presented as recommendations rather than law, its Office for Civil Rights can put any school that fails to follow them on the list of colleges under investigation and even take away its federal funding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no doubt that on many occasions colleges have not treated sexual-assault accusations as seriously as they should have. Nor did they do enough to ensure that women felt completely safe on campus. But in the past half-decade, the civil rights office has tried so hard to correct that problem that it is now forcing schools to go too far in the other direction, which has made campus procedures seem even less credible. Schools are being told to disregard what most Americans think of as the basic civil rights of a person accused of a heinous act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other things, schools have to determine guilt on the basis of a \"preponderance of\" rather than \"clear and convincing\" evidence -- that is, on a 51 percent likelihood that the man did it, rather than a 75 percent one. (In these cases, the accused is almost always a man, although the accuser is by no means always a woman.) Neither party is allowed to cross-examine the other, lest direct questioning re-traumatize a victim. Schools must resolve cases swiftly -- the original requirement was 60 days, though the latest guidelines leave out the number and simply stress the need for a prompt resolution -- even if a criminal investigation is going forward at a slower pace.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That puts a student who wants to defend himself at risk of saying things that could later be used against him in court -- and at many schools, he's not even allowed to let a lawyer speak for him. At least 30 male students, some of whom were suspended or expelled for sexual misconduct, have filed suits against their universities, claiming that the process was unfair.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should universities do to convince the world that they're fit to deal with campus rape? First, they should band together and demand that the government rethink its guidelines, especially those that flout the key tenets of due process. Second, they should ask the Office for Civil Rights to clarify its notion of sexual misconduct, now left to each school to define. Is it rape if a man fails to get affirmative consent at every stage of a sexual interaction, or only if he ignores a spoken objection? If a man and a woman are equally drunk, should he be found guilty of assaulting her because she was too intoxicated to agree to sex, even though he himself may have been too drunk to know that? (Right now, at most schools, he would be considered guilty.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, universities should insist that determinations of guilt or innocence rely on a \"reasonable-person test,\" according to which the accused is only culpable if a reasonable person would have considered his actions to be wrong. Without that standard, his fate may rest on her subjective judgment -- if she feels that he imposed unwanted sexual contact on her, no matter what he actually did, then he can be found to have harassed or raped her. (Harvard's controversial new policy leaves out the reasonable-person standard, which is partly why 28 of its law professors have publicly objected to it.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth step, however, may be the most important. Though schools have the right to uphold their own standards of conduct, the government is currently scaring them into creating big, expensive bureaucracies and designing unduly cumbersome policies. Meanwhile, there are many more 18- to 25-year-old rape victims outside the walls of colleges than inside them. The smarter and more public-spirited thing for schools to do would be to divert at least some of their time and energy to forming partnerships with local law enforcement agencies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is widely believed that the police are insensitive to rape victims. Universities, on the whole, have a great deal of clout in their communities; they also possess considerable intellectual resources. They could be helping policemen and prosecutors do a better job with sexual violence cases instead of squandering money and good will on their own all-too-easily second-guessed shadow justice systems.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JUDITH SHULEVITZ   Judith Shulevitz is the author of \"The Sabbath World: Glimpses of a Different Order of Time.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Columbia University, On Friday.

That's nonsense and he knows it</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again a Supreme Court nominee has insulted the intelligence of the American public by likening justices to \u201cumpires.\u201d Echoing the language used by John Roberts at his confirmation hearings in 2005, Brett Kavanaugh declared Tuesday before the Senate: \u201cA good judge must be an umpire \u2014 a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.\u2026 I don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.\u201d</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But justices are not umpires at all. Umpires apply rules and have little leeway in determining how those rules should be interpreted. The Supreme Court creates the rules and justices have enormous discretion how to interpret the law. By likening himself to an umpire, Kavanaugh was contending that his views don\u2019t matter at all. That is false.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How a justice votes is very much a result of his or her ideology and views. Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor disagree in virtually every major case entirely because of their differing ideologies. This is not new; Supreme Court decisions have always been a product of those sitting on the bench.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Constitution was written \u00ad\u2014 intentionally \u2014 in broad, open-ended language that rarely provides guidance for issues that must be resolved by the Supreme Court. Justices are obligated to give meaning to ambiguous words written almost 230 years ago. What is \u201cspeech\u201d? For example, should spending money in an election campaign be regarded as a form of speech? This is the issue at the heart of whether campaign spending limits violate the 1st Amendment. The text of the Constitution cannot answer the question of whether spending money is speech. Nor did the founders think about this in 1789, when campaign spending did not exist as it does today.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the most controversial parts of the Constitution, the 2nd Amendment reads: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Is this a right to have guns only for militia service or does it create a more general right of individuals to possess firearms? On this question, the court split 5-4 exactly along ideological lines in District of Columbia vs. Heller in 2008 and declared unconstitutional a 32-year-old ordinance prohibiting ownership or possession of handguns. The conservative majority chose to read the 2nd Amendment as a right of individuals to possess handguns in their homes for the sake of security, while the liberals argued that the 2nd Amendment is a right to have guns solely for the purpose of militia service. Either is a plausible reading of the text supportable by the amendment\u2019s history.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No constitutional right is absolute and constitutional cases constantly involve balancing of the government\u2019s interest against the claim of a right. A justice\u2019s own ideology and life experiences inevitably determine how he or she strikes the balance.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To pick an easy example, the 4th Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and arrests. But what is reasonable or unreasonable cannot be answered from the text of the Constitution or any original understanding. When the court considered whether the police can take a DNA sample from a person arrested for a serious crime to see if it matches DNA from an unsolved crime in a police database, the court explicitly balanced the benefit to law enforcement of obtaining the information against the intrusion to privacy and ruled, 5-4, in favor of the government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion \u00bb</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under constitutional law, the court frequently weighs whether the government has a \u201ccompelling\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d or a \u201clegitimate\u201d interest. For example, in cases involving <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in college admissions, the central question is whether diversity in the classroom is a compelling government interest. In deciding the constitutionality of laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, the court had to decide, at a minimum, whether they serve a legitimate interest. But whether something is a \u201ccompelling\u201d or an \u201cimportant\u201d or a \u201clegitimate\u201d government interest demands a value choice. It never can be answered by the text of the Constitution or its original understanding.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump, senators and the public all know that justices are not like umpires, which is exactly why the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees are so contentious. Kavanaugh obviously knows this, too, and should not have presented such a misleading sense of constitutional law to the Senate Judiciary Committee or the American public.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Erwin Chemerinsky is dean and Jesse H.

These essays, accumulated from 1946 to 1961, offer a vivid, stimulating challenge to that \"age of conformity.\" If variety is a charm of essay collections, their bane can be a random unevenness -- here overcome by a furiously cool, contrarian intelligence, which unifies this assortment of pieces about politics, literature, sex, theater and fashion. Questioning with aphoristic zingers the Kinsey Reports' mechanistic approach to the female orgasm, the journalistic pieties of John Hersey's \"Hiroshima,\" the upwardly mobile aspirations of women's fashion magazines, the genius of Tennessee Williams, the anti-American tourist reports of Simone de Beauvoir, the outrages of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Mary McCarthy spares neither the right nor the left -- nor herself. In \"My Confession,\" she describes how, starting out from the wrong motives -- ignorance, shallowness, vanity, social snobbery -- she arrived at a coherent liberal anticommunist position. \"I realized, with a certain wistfulness, that it was too late for me to become a Marxist. Marxism, I saw, from the learned young men I listened to at Committee meetings, was something you had to take up young, like ballet dancing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Essays of Leonard Michaels</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edited by Katharine Ogden Michaels (2009)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. A master of the short story, whose tales conveyed high anxiety, urban violence and exuberant intellectual analysis, Leonard Michaels was also an extraordinarily fine essayist. This collection, assembled posthumously by his widow, is divided between critical and autobiographical essays, though everything Michaels wrote was deeply personal. Whether seeing as a boy the movie \"Gilda,\" where the heroine marries a sadist played by George Macready (\"I didn't want Macready to unzipper Rita Hayworth's dress\"), or his father offering him some money before his date (\"He gave. I took.\"), Michaels gets to feelings of vulnerability and shame with astonishing speed. Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by Jewish immigrant parents, speaking only Yiddish until he was 5, he perfected a terse English sentence that carries traces of Yiddish's ironic, singsong, questioning shrug. \"Paradox as a cognitive mode is everywhere in Yiddish. It's probably in the genes and may explain the Jewish love of jokes.\" His humor is both hilarious and dark, issuing from an evolved persona that had elements of the street-savvy hipster, academic and Talmudist. Above all, he was a storyteller -- proof positive that good essays are at bottom stories about the mind at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speak, Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Vladimir Nabokov (1951)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. A series of linked autobiographical essays by one of the masters of modern prose, this marvel of a memoir begins with the rather dire sentiment: \"The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our true existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.\" That crack of light becomes suffused with sunshine, as Vladimir Nabokov recollects his enchanted boyhood, the pampered son of aristocratic parents, surrounded by 50 servants in their St. Petersburg townhouse and country estate. In dreamy, nostalgic, prismatic sentences colored with sensuous detail, the author conjures up a way of life soon to become extinct, erased by the Bolsheviks' takeover. Nabokov takes the narrative further into his darker years of exile, loss, poverty and literary apprenticeship, meanwhile conversing with his tender ghosts. There is a loving portrait of his liberal, witty jurist father, who passed on to Vladimir a butterfly-hunting obsession, as well as his mother, relatives and tutors. But the gem of the collection is a portrait of his portly Swiss-French governess, Mademoiselle, who specialized in feeling proud and miserable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hunger of Memory</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Richard Rodriguez (1982)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Subtitled \"The Education of Richard Rodriguez,\" this brilliant debut announced an author who would go on to write captivating essays for decades to come. Ignoring an editor's advice that he write \"in stories -- not a series of essays. Let's have more Grandma,\" Mr. Rodriguez chose the essay form because it allowed him to pursue a political argument via his personal experience. At the time, his opposition to bilingual education and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> raised hackles, yet so effectively was he able to portray the distance between the intimate Spanish of his home and the public English of his schooling that his position made perfect sense, at least to himself. \"I remember what was so grievously lost to define what was necessarily gained.\" The son of working-class parents who spoke broken English, he excelled at schoolwork and became a \"scholarship boy\" whose immersion in a cultivated, moneyed world drew him unavoidably if guiltily away from his loving family. Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates, with alarming frankness and elegant prose, a singular perspective, deeply moral, fusing sardonic detachment and affective longing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Sign of Saturn</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By Susan Sontag (1980)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. After her first two essay books, \"Against Interpretation\" and \"Styles of Radical Will,\" established Susan Sontag as our exigent queen of cultural criticism, she allowed herself to relax some of that cerebral severity, bringing a more generous warmth to her third collection. She began \"Under the Sign of Saturn\" with a touching tribute to a writer she greatly admired: \"The grief I feel at Paul Goodman's death is sharper because we were not friends, though we co-inhabited several of the same worlds. . . . I disliked him -- the reason being, as I often explained plaintively during his lifetime, that I felt he didn't like me.\" This honest piece was followed by the magnificent title essay, a deeply insightful portrait of Walter Benjamin, the brainy, depressive writer with whom Sontag felt a kinship, as well as superb appreciations of Antonin Artaud, Elias Canetti and Sontag's friend and mentor, Roland Barthes. The collection also features Sontag's celebrated takedown of Leni Riefenstahl, \"Fascinating Fascism,\" but for the most part Sontag gives herself over here to her love of various heroes of the life of the mind.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Phillip Lopate</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"relevance": {"It is discussed briefly.": "2"}, "stance": {"Somewhat Against ": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}
