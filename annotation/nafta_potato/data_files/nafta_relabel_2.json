{"id": "1661212339.xml", "text": "<h2>Will the GOP deliver Obama's best legacy?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Froman received from a Harvard Law School classmate, Barack Obama, a job that validates the axiom that the unlikelihood of any negotiation reaching agreement grows by the square of the number of parties involved. In <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, even one's own country is troublesome, as the catfish conundrum illustrates. And the degree of difficulty in achieving a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact is proportional to the number of Democrats in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Froman's goal is completion and ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific nations, from Chile to South Korea, that generate 37 percent of the world's economic product. The TPP aims not just to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but also to reform some of these nations' domestic policies, particularly concerning labor and environmental issues, partly to entice certain Democratic constituencies to soften their opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some developing nations, such as Vietnam, welcome some compulsory rationality - being required by trading rules to limit subsidies to sclerotic state-owned enterprises. But beware of ostensibly altruistic protectionism - protectionism with moral pretensions. Sometimes poorer nations want higher standards forced on them. Other times rich nations use higher standards to raise production costs in, and thereby lower the competitiveness of, poorer countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Negotiation and ratification of the TPP will be easier if Congress gives Obama what prior presidents have received - \"fast-track\" authority guaranteeing an up-or-down vote on the agreement without amendments. But Obama's aggressive aggrandizement of executive power through unilateral actions (regarding the Affordable Care Act, immigration, etc.) has been unprecedented in its sweep and undisguised in its disdain for Congress. This has produced the much-praised but elusive joy of bipartisanship: Conservative Republicans, eager to express separation-of-powers rectitude, are joining liberal Democrats, eager to derail any agreement, in opposing fast track.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immersed in this political equivalent of three- dimensional chess, the administration is serenely confident that enough Democratic votes will join with large majorities of Republicans to ratify what is negotiated, even without fast track. Even if Republicans representing Southern catfish farmers must be mollified by restricting imports of Asian catfish that are processed in American plants in blue states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two largest achievements during Bill Clinton's presidency occurred in spite of Democrats. Welfare reform was forced upon him by a Republican-controlled Congress (he vetoed it twice before relenting), and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was ratified in spite of congressional Democrats (a majority of whom voted against it). Now, the TPP - potentially the best result of the Obama years - depends on Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are plucking up the protectionist banner unfurled by 19th-century Republicans, who were tireless defenders of the strong (manufacturers) against consumers. Today, many Democrats agree with Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who says that the United States \"has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Notice the slippery language (\"since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\"), and remember the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy: The rooster crows and then the sun rises, therefore the crowing caused the sunrise. Manufacturing jobs have been declining as a share of total employment since 1950 and in actual number since 1979. But because of productivity improvements, manufacturing production and exports are near all-time highs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Froman says, some imports substitute for domestic products. But many imports are \"intermediate goods\" that go into the production of domestic goods, some of which are exported. And, he says, 50 percent of imports from Canada and Mexico, our first- and third-largest trading partners, are used as inputs in the manufacturing of American products. Furthermore, Froman says, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is progressive in the sense that lower-income Americans spend a larger portion of their disposable income than more affluent Americans spend on such imports such as food and clothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You who are reading this column probably have a chronic, indeed incurable <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with your barber or hairdresser. You regularly buy what he or she sells, yet he or she never buys anything from you. But things somehow work out. As they do between nations, because as the late Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, once wrote, \"International transactions are always in balance, by definition.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Protectionism,\" said Clinton during the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, \"is just a fancy word for giving up; we want to compete and win.\" But now, even more than then, Democrats are the party of a United States in a defensive crouch, flinching from globalization's challenges. Besides, progressivism's constant agenda is to expand the role of government and contract the role of markets in allocating wealth and opportunity. Republicans rescuing Obama's best idea would be an interesting coda to his presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: George F.

{"id": "1783212944.xml", "text": "<h2>Five Big Truths About Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is, once again, a hot-button political issue, making this an unpropitious time for rational discourse about the subject. Nonetheless, here are five issues on which the overwhelming majority of economists, liberal and conservative, agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1. Most job losses are not due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Every month roughly five million new jobs are created in the U.S. and almost that many are destroyed, leaving a small net increment. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accounts for only a minor share of that staggering job churn. Vastly more derives from the hurly-burly of competition and from technological change, which literally creates and destroys entire industries. Competition and technology are widely and correctly applauded -- international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not so fortunate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is more about efficiency -- and hence wages -- than about the number of jobs. You probably don't sew your own clothes or grow your own food. Instead, you buy these things from others, using the wages you earn doing something you do better. Imagine how much lower your standard of living would be if you had to sew your own clothes, grow your own food . . . and a thousand other things.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is no different. It's not mainly about creating or destroying jobs. It's about using labor more efficiently, which is one key to higher wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is a catch: Whenever <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns change, some people will gain (either jobs or wages) but others will lose. The federal government could and should help them more, but it doesn't. So Americans who do lose their jobs due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have a legitimate gripe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. Bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalances are inevitable and mostly uninteresting. Each month I run a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Public Service Electric & Gas. They sell me gas and electricity; I sell them nothing. But I run a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Princeton University, to which I sell teaching services but from which I buy little. Should I seek balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with PSE&G or Princeton? Of course not. Neither should countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Running an overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit does not make us \"losers.\" The U.S. multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance -- its balance with all of its trading partners -- has been in deficit for decades. Does that mean that our country is in some sort of trouble? Probably not. For example, people who claim that our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit kills jobs need to explain how the U.S. managed to achieve 4% unemployment in 2000, when our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was larger, as a share of GDP, than it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit means that foreigners send us more goods and services than we send them. To balance the books, they get our IOUs, which means they wind up holding paper -- U.S. Treasury bills, corporate bonds or other private debt instruments. That doesn't sound so terrible for us, does it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exceptional country -- the U.S. -- is the source of the world's major international reserve currency, the U.S. dollar. Since ever-expanding world commerce requires ever more dollars, the U.S. must run <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits regularly. That's sometimes called our \"exorbitant privilege,\" since we get to import more than we export.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements barely affect a nation's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. Much of the political angst is directed not at <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in general, but at specific international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement allegedly shipped U.S. jobs to Mexico; the Trans-Pacific Partnership will allegedly ship U.S. jobs abroad as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a grain of truth here. Some U.S. jobs were indeed destroyed when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico -- and those people deserved better treatment from the government than they got. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also created a number of new jobs in the U.S. (See No. 2.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's more. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>\" and \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements\" are not synonyms. We <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d with Mexico long before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was growing. Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China has burgeoned in recent decades without a succession of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most fundamentally, but least understood, a nation's overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance is determined by its domestic decisions, not by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Think about the accounting involved here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As noted above, borrowing from abroad is the bookkeeping counterpart of running a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. One implies the other. The amount we borrow from abroad must equal the gap between our total spending as a nation (including government spending) and our total income (including the government's income from taxation). Spendthrift nations like the U.S. have <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits because we don't save much. But these saving decisions are domestic; they do not derive from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits stem from the dollar's international role and from Americans' decisions not to save much, not from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits are not a major cause of either job losses or job gains. But some people do lose their jobs from shifting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns; and the government should do more to help them. Importantly, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes American workers more productive and, presumably, better paid.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, would someone please tell this to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Look at the Darker Side of Free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Policy\" -- WSJ May. 3, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Alan S.

{"id": "1825355946.xml", "text": "<h2>No Painless Way to Undo Nafta, and Few Rewards for the Trouble</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When you buy an \"American-made\" car, you are probably buying a car that has an immensely complicated mix of components that were also made in Mexico and Canada. The same is true for many electronics, and advanced textiles like carpeting. The beef in your grocery store might be from a cow that was fattened and slaughtered in the United States, but that was very likely born across the border in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the world that has evolved in the almost 23 years since the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was enacted. These deep economic interconnections show why trying to unravel what Donald J. Trump, in last week's debate, called \"the single worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever approved in this country\" would be no easy feat. It would risk disrupting the very underpinnings of industries that employ millions of Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The view among mainstream economists is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, over all, has raised incomes in the United States while also costing it thousands of manufacturing jobs. But whether you view the agreement as a net positive or a net negative for the country, the reality is that the United States, Canada and Mexico are now for all practical purposes a single integrated economy. That has wide-ranging consequences -- especially if the next president tries to reshape or abandon the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the border between Santa Teresa, N.M., and the Mexican town of San Jeronimo, up to 5,000 head of cattle a day amble across the border; they are less likely to become stressed and lose weight when they walk under their own power than when loaded into semis. After being bred in the hills of Northern Mexico, and after eating American corn, they become a key input for the American beef industry. It creates jobs in feedlots and slaughterhouses in the United States, where the animals are fattened, and produces less costly beef for consumers in the United States and in the global markets to which the beef is exported.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few miles away, Mexican workers in a Foxconn facility assemble Dell computers that were designed in Texas and will be sold all over the world. Low labor costs keep Dell on a competitive footing with global competitors like China's Lenovo. Because of that, Dell can employ thousands of highly paid engineers and salespeople in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And American automobile companies have supply chains that are so thoroughly integrated across the Canadian and Mexican borders that when huge traffic backups developed on the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, because of intensive security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Michigan auto factories were at risk of having to shut down for want of supplies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The auto industry is so intertwined among the three countries that it's almost useless to think of a car as being \"made in the United States,\" even if the final assembly takes place within America's borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You have what looks like an American car, with Mexican labor and materials that went into it and Canadian materials,\" said James Bookbinder, a professor of logistics and manufacturing at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \"It's really from the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> region, and in the process some of those jobs created are in Mexico, but there are also jobs in the United States because all these pieces fit together.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a general rule, Mexican suppliers make parts that can be done with low-skilled labor and relatively simple assembly -- plastic bumpers, seats or dashboards. More complex parts like engines, transmissions and electronics components are more likely to be made in the United States or Canada, where the workers and suppliers with more advanced skills are in greater supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A transmission is a complicated piece of machinery and might go back and forth across the border three or four times as different components are added at different plants,\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are parallels elsewhere in the world. In Europe, German manufacturing is extraordinarily successful on the world stage -- but many of the more labor-intensive, lower-value inputs for German cars and other manufactured goods come from lower-wage countries in the European Union like Poland and Hungary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's true that there have been fewer auto-making jobs in the United States since the introduction of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 926,000 jobs making motor vehicles and parts is down 15 percent since December 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's hard to untangle the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the shifting of some work to Mexico from the advanced technology like robotics that reduces the man-hours it takes to build a car. Overall manufacturing employment in the United States is down 27 percent in the same span.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's this tendency to say, 'It's all moving to Mexico,' \" said Bernard Swiecki, a senior analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. But the center's research finds that automakers have spent $77 billion on new or upgraded capital projects in the United States since 2010, compared with $26 billion in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The improved competitiveness of American companies in the global auto market since the 1990s has happened in part because they have built more efficient North American supply chains. Different parts of the car are made in the place where the local labor force and cost structure are the best fit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If a product uses really sophisticated materials like high-strength steels and advanced composites, and more sophisticated processes,\" Mr. Swiecki said, there's a better chance you can find the people with the skills needed in the United States or Canada. Meanwhile, the lower price of labor-intensive parts imported from Mexico helps control the cost of the overall automobile and makes it more competitive with cars built in Europe or Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1990s, major automakers based outside the United States have built American factories to gain access to these local supply networks and get closer to American consumers. That has to do with a lot more than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but the connections between North American parts suppliers across borders surely helped speed the process.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American auto industry is not the only sector where such a transformation has occurred, Mr. Hufbauer says. American textile companies make technologically advanced fabrics like those for carpeting, parachutes or the steel mesh inside tires. They are exported to Mexico, where the more labor-intensive work of turning those into finished goods is done. The same goes for many electronics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if you accept that these trends contribute to higher economic output, and to more high-income jobs and more competitive companies in the United States, it's not as if the anxiety about losing jobs that Mr. Trump describes doesn't have a realistic basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, it's fine to say that Dell is a more competitive, successful company by assembling computers in Juarez, which creates more high-paying jobs for the people who design and sell those computers. But that isn't much solace if you were one of the 905 people who lost jobs at the plant in Winston-Salem, N.C., doing that same work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the narrative promulgated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> skeptics that a more integrated global economy has worsened job opportunities for certain workers isn't wrong. But it's also not a given that the trend will reverse itself if the next president does seek to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We don't know exactly what a President Trump would do in seeking to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, or what exactly the consequences would be of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war between the United States and its partners. And a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war could well erupt if he were to follow through on some of his aggressive statements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we do know is that even relatively small tariffs can stand in the way of the kind of supply networks on which many modern industries are based. With these networks, goods can cross back and forth across national borders multiple times as part of the pipeline that leads to a finished automobile or a computer or even a side of beef. It's not that companies couldn't adjust; over time they could. It's that the networks evolved this way for a reason, and readjusting would come at a considerable cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More fundamentally, trying to reject the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with America's neighbors entirely would mean upending major industries and a generation's worth of economic integration. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has had its flaws and downsides. But either major American industries would have to figure out how to restructure themselves to rely less on the movement of goods across borders, or the United States would find itself poorer and more of an island in the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

For Mexico, he said, the wall issue is \"a matter of national dignity and sovereignty.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has vowed to begin construction on the wall soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration. He plans to press Congress to fund the project and then find ways to have Mexico reimburse those costs later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The caustic back and forth between Trump and top Mexican officials, which along with fears of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war this week sent the value of the peso plunging to record lows, raises the question: Can Trump really force Mexico to pay for the wall?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We talked to several experts about that -- as well as what Trump's threats against Mexico could mean for the economies of both countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will Trump be able to persuade Mexico to pay for the wall?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The Mexican government isn't willing to pay for the wall in any way,\" said Alfredo Coutino, Latin America director for Moody's Analytics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reaffirmed that sentiment in a speech Wednesday, saying \"of course\" Mexico won't fund the wall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Handing over billions of dollars for the construction of the wall would be political suicide for Pena Nieto, who saw his approval ratings sink after he met with Trump in Mexico City last fall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But besides that, there is a more practical concern.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico doesn't have the money to pay for it,\" said Coutino. An already shaky economic situation was made more unstable Jan. 1 when the Mexican government suddenly deregulated gasoline prices. Gas prices rose as much as 20%, triggering angry demonstrations across the country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent weeks, Trump has acknowledged that it is unlikely the U.S. would receive a direct payment from Mexico, whose economy has been plagued by slow growth and rising inflation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Probably less likely that it's a payment,\" he added.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could the U.S. try to recoup the costs?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way is taxing remittances, an idea Trump has floated in the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015, Mexico received nearly $25 billion in remittances from citizens living outside the country, most of them from the U.S., according to the Bank of Mexico, the country's central banking system. Trump has suggested much of that money is sent from people who are living in the United States illegally, although according to PolitiFact, there is no way to track the legal status of remittance senders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Trump pushed Congress to approve, say, a 10% tax on remittances, that could generate $10 billion dollars for the U.S. government over four years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump could \"slice and dice\" the situation to make it appear that Mexico is paying a tax to fund a border wall, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow specializing in U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. But ultimately, it would be Mexican immigrants who were paying.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's an ugly and regressive tax, because you're essentially taxing poor people,\" Alden said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a precedent for taxing remittances?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, at least on the state level. Since 2009, Oklahoma has charged a 1% fee -- critics call it a tax -- on all personal wire transfers of cash to accounts outside the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fee is a withholding on state income tax, and when residents file taxes, they get the money back. However, those in the country illegally who send money abroad do not receive the cash back -- a move that in effect taxes them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Could the U.S. only target remittances sent to Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That could be difficult. Any federal tax on remittances probably would have to be applied across the board to people sending money to all countries, analysts say.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Taxing one specific group of people on their remittances could be considered discriminatory,\" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about Trump's pledge to tax imports from Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the help of Congress, Trump could immediately impose new taxes on goods imported from Mexico. He could claim that is one way Mexico is paying the costs of the wall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But new taxes could draw lawsuits, Wilson said, because the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement bars the U.S. from assessing tariffs on goods made in Canada or Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has pledged to immediately start renegotiating that deal to make it more fair for American workers, but that process could stretch years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How would changes to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals affect the economy?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canceling or making serious changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could paralyze major American industries, like the automotive and food and beverage sectors, Coutino said. If that happens, \"the U.S. runs the risk of going into recession.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The consequences for Mexico also could be devastating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico would almost certainly go into recession too,\" Coutino said, because Mexico's faltering economy would limit officials' ability to lower interest rates and pump money into the economy like U.S. leaders did during the Great Recession.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A recession in Mexico, Coutino said, could unleash major unintended consequences in the U.S. that could ultimately undermine Trump's efforts to even the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> playing field and limit illegal immigration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In indirectly inducing the weakening of the peso, Trump is making Mexican exports more attractive for American consumers,\" Coutino said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If you block Mexico in terms of exports, investing and remittances, Mexico's economy is going to sink, unemployment is going to rise, and guess what? More Mexicans are going to be willing to take the risk of crossing the border into the U.S.,\" Coutino said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would create a certain irony. Though Central Americans have been trying to reach the U.S. in greater numbers, net migration from Mexico has remained zero for several years, with U.S. and Mexican government data showing more people returning to Mexico than entering the U.S. illegally each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What can Mexico do about Trump's plans?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has little say in several of the changes Trump has proposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is nothing Mexico could do to block a tax on remittances. And although it could impose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tariffs on imports from the U.S., that would not have a big effect because Mexico exports more than it imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, Pena Nieto suggested that if Trump tries to punish Mexico on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or other fronts, Mexico may push back by leveraging its cooperation with the U.S. on crucial issues such as immigration and security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years, Mexico has stepped up enforcement efforts along its southern border to help the U.S. slow immigration from Central America and other parts of the world. Between October 2014 and May 2015, for example, Mexican authorities detained more Central American migrants than the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Mexico and the U.S. collaborate closely on security issues, from intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies to the Merida Initiative, a partnership forged in 2007 to help reduce the power of drug trafficking in Mexico. Since then, the U.S. has contributed more than $2 billion to Mexico in police training and cash for better security equipment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the effectiveness of using security and immigration as bargaining chips is questionable, experts say, in part because U.S. funding for those efforts is also in Mexico's interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves Mexico, Coutino said, \"basically at the mercy of the U.S.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The most likely scenario is that the Trump administration will find some way to claim that they have forced Mexico to pay for the additional border fencing,\" Wilson said. \"And Mexico will claim that it was paid for by Congress and the Trump administration.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kate.linthicum@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kurtis.lee@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Linthicum reported from Mexico City and Lee from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: A BORDER FENCE separates Tecate, Calif., left, and Tecate, Mexico.

{"id": "1871366920.xml", "text": "<h2>A fresh way to do the math on trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing you need to know about the latest controversy involving President Trump's alleged attempt to manipulate economic data for political purposes is that Bernie Sanders probably would have done the same thing, and quite possibly Hillary Clinton, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mainstream economists recoiled at a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that said Trump appointees at the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative want official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances between the United States and various countries rejiggered to make bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits seem larger - and, by implication, Trump's protectionist policies more necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his blog, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and author of a leading economics textbook, responded simply: \"You've got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Per long-standing international economic practice, the headline figure for the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and any other nation has been expressed as the difference between two numbers: the value of U.S. imports from that trading partner and the value of U.S. exports to it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, however, left-wing critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have said that this data point distorts the deals' actual impact. In 2014, 14 Democratic members of the House - including current party-chair candidate and 2016 Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) - wrote to President Barack Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative demanding that he adopt the same math that Trump is reportedly contemplating. One of the first to defend Trump this week was Lori Wallach, a left-wing anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> activist at Public Citizen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do they have a point? Well, kinda sorta. The headline numbers lump together made-in-the-USA exports with goods produced in third countries that enter the United States on their way elsewhere. Example: Samsung TVs from South Korea land at Long Beach, Calif., and get trucked to Tijuana, perhaps after a little repackaging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since these \"re-exports\" by definition aren't made by American workers, critics argue that it's more accurate, in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s impact on U.S. jobs, to focus on the difference between purely made-in-the-USA exports and imports that remain in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would dramatically alter reported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with Mexico and Canada, to which nearly half of all U.S. re-exports go - since those nations border us and don't have tariffs, thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 2016 U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico would have been not $63.1 billion but $115.4 billion, the Journal noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that, no matter how you count it, a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit (or surplus) per se is neither good nor bad - unfashionable though it may be to restate that basic tenet of economic theory amid the current left-right protectionist convergence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> undoubtedly displaced American workers in certain sectors, just as it also created new job opportunities elsewhere - including in the vast logistical chain through which re-exports flow. And it enabled U.S. consumers to access various desirable goods at lower prices than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits are diffuse and the job losses concentrated and acutely felt, of course - a fact of politics, not economics, that Trump's data massage seems designed to exploit. (No final decision has been made, the administration told the Journal.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no legitimate full-disclosure issue here, since the data Trump and his progressive bedfellows prefer is already available from the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission. What they want is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative's imprimatur on their ideology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the rigid distinction between U.S.-made goods - which \"create jobs\" - and all others is breaking down due to global supply chains. Economist Lee Ohanian of UCLA has reported that the production process for certain goods takes them back and forth over the U.S.-Mexico border 14 times before they're ready for market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many imports from China are assembled from inputs made in other countries. Example: the iPhone, whose components come from Japan, Korea, Germany and, indeed, the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ideally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> figures would take the iPhone apart, so to speak, awarding each country in the chain credit for the value its workers added. Analysts at the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are working on just such a \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added\" concept.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their results are tentative, and not fully up to date, but still suggestive: The United States' value-added <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan in recent years was larger than the conventionally measured one; by contrast, U.S. deficits with China, Mexico and Canada are actually smaller in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economist Yingying Xu of the Arlington-based Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation calculates that the United States actually ran 2009 surpluses in manufactured goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> critics inside and outside the Trump administration want information-rich, consistent measures of 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows, they should support innovations such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added - instead of perpetuating the same old political numbers games. Obviously, that's a big if.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1878595149.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta Has Made Mexico a Better Place; Civil society, long neutralized during the PRI autarky, has awakened.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One common beef with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is that 23 years after it went live Mexico remains a developing country. Because Mexico's standard of living is still below that of its northern counterparts and a weak rule of law persists, critics argue that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet in this analysis the fault lies with the expectations, not the outcome. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was never going to convert Mexico into a Spanish-speaking Switzerland in one generation. On the other hand, few would have predicted the civil, political and economic achievements of the past two decades. That this has happened while American drug consumers have been financing vicious organized-crime networks in the country is even more impressive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the news in January that Ernesto Canales, the anticorruption czar in the Mexican state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, had jailed former Gov. Rodrigo Medina of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on charges of corruption during his term from 2009-15.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting a powerful member of the PRI behind bars, even temporarily, was a first for the state. Mr. Medina was released the next day by a federal judge on a procedural technicality but he still faces trial on corruption charges that could result in a sentence of up to 36 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter the outcome, Mr. Canales told the Mexican media, politicians are now on notice. Making a play on words in Spanish with the Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" he warned that Mexico's \"100 years of impunity\" are over.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago Mexico was a one-party state run by the PRI. The authoritarian machine, which had been in power since 1929, had industrialized the country and kept the lid on civilian lawlessness much like Gen. Francisco Franco did in Spain from 1939-75. But the corporatist model, in which the state owned or controlled business and labor organizations, held the nation back. Fiscal mismanagement spawned successive bouts of devaluation and hyperinflation. A repressive state apparatus contained social unrest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the 1980s Mexico looked more like Egypt--poor, backward and undemocratic--than like a member of Western civilization. Democratic capitalists on both sides of the border wanted change. But as the \"Arab Spring\" demonstrated, the transformation from tyranny to liberty requires more than desire.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political reform was not on the agenda when PRI President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in 1988. But the economy was in bad shape, and renewed growth depended on opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Canada. President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to pursue a continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment treaty with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and brought commitments to competition, privatization and foreign capital. Cross-border commercial relationships required improvements in civil law. For the first time in more than six decades, Mexico had the fundamentals of a market economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mexican economist Luis de la Calle and political scientist Luis Rubio show in their 2010 book, \"Mexico: A Middle Class Society</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>,\" today's consumption patterns indicate that the nation is no longer \"poor.\" But this is about more than an increase in creature comforts for a wider number of Mexicans. It is also about the spread of middle-class values in education, civil rights and culture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption went unacknowledged in old Mexico because graft was a party entitlement, the press was controlled by the state and whistleblowers were easily ruined. But 6\u00bd years after the birth of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the PRI lost executive power at the ballot box.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Journal's Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba and Juan Montes reported</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>earlier this month, some state politicians read the end of PRI dominance at the federal level as merely the decentralization of corruption. But they didn't count on how civil society, which had been neutralized during PRI autarky, also awakened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015 Jaime Rodr\u00edguez, a political outsider with no party, was elected governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n on a single issue: ending corruption. He named Mr. Canales to head an independent office, inside the attorney general's office, to investigate corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit to the state capital of Monterrey in February, I met with seven members of the Canales team. They shared with me some of their findings, including what they allege was a sophisticated scheme of \"simulation,\" in which chosen contractors created duplicate billing for infrastructure projects during the Medina term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite a federal prohibition on the right to subpoena state records, Mr. Canales's office collected enough evidence to charge, among other things, that Mr. Medina's administration signed thousands of overpriced public-works contracts with favored companies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Medina maintains his innocence.

{"id": "1883073849.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Is Wimping Out on Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign, Donald Trump talked loudly and often about how he was going to renegotiate America's \"horrible <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals,\" bringing back millions of good jobs. So far, however, nothing has happened. Not only is Trumpist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy -- Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>? -- nowhere to be seen in practice; there isn't even any indication of what it will involve.So on Friday the White House scheduled a ceremony in which Mr. Trump would sign two new executive orders on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The goal, presumably, was to counteract the growing impression that his bombast on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was sound and fury signifying nothing.Unfortunately, the executive orders in question were, to use the technical term, nothingburgers. One called for a report on the causes of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit; wait, they're just starting to study the issue? The other addressed some minor issues of tariff collection, and its content apparently duplicated an act President Obama already signed last year.Not surprisingly, reporters at the event questioned the president, not about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but about Michael Flynn and the Russia connection. Mr. Trump then walked out of the room -- without signing the orders. (Vice President Mike Pence gathered them up, and the White House claims that they were signed later.)The fiasco perfectly encapsulated what's looking more and more like a failed agenda.Business seems to have decided that Mr. Trump is a paper tiger on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: The flow of corporate relocations to Mexico, which slowed briefly while C.E.O.s tried to curry favor with the new president, has resumed. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> policy by tweet, it appears, has run its course.Investors seem to have reached the same conclusion: The Mexican peso plunged 16 percent after the election, but since Inauguration Day it has recovered almost all the lost ground.Oh, and last week a draft proposal for revising the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement circulated around Congress; instead of sweeping changes in what candidate Trump called the \"worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal\" ever signed, the administration appears to be seeking only modest tweaks.This surely isn't what working-class Trump supporters thought they were voting for. So why can Trumpist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy be summarized -- to quote The Times's Binyamin Appelbaum -- as \"talk loudly and carry a small stick\"? Let me give two reasons.First, back when Mr. Trump was railing against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, he had no idea what he was talking about. (I know, you're shocked to hear that.)For example, listening to the Tweeter-in-chief, you'd think that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a big giveaway by the United States, which got nothing in return. In fact, Mexico drastically cut its tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., in return for much smaller cuts on the U.S. side.Or take Mr. Trump's repeated claims that China gains a competitive advantage by manipulating its currency. That was true six years ago, but it's not true now. These days China is actually intervening to keep its currency up, not down.Talking nonsense about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't hurt Mr. Trump during the campaign. But now he's finding out that those grossly unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals he promised to renegotiate aren't all that unfair, after all, leaving him with no idea what to do next.Which brings me to Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s second big obstacle: Whatever you think of past <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is now deeply embedded in the economy.Consider the case of automobiles. At this point it makes little sense to talk about a U.S. auto industry, a Canadian auto industry or a Mexican auto industry. What we have instead is a tightly integrated North American industry, in which vehicles and components crisscross the continent, with almost every finished car containing components from all three nations.Does it have to be this way? No. Slap on 30 percent tariffs, and after a few years those national industries would separate again. But the transition would be chaotic and painful.Economists talk, with considerable justification, about the \"China shock\": the disruptive effect on jobs and communities of the rapid growth of Chinese exports from the 1990s through 2007. But reversing globalization now would produce an equally painful \"Trump shock,\" disrupting jobs and communities all over again -- and would also be painful for some of the big corporate interests that, strange to say, have a lot of influence in this supposedly populist regime.The point is that at a deep level Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is running into the same wall that caused Trumpcare to crash and burn. Mr. Trump came into office talking big, sure that his predecessors had messed everything up and he -- he alone -- could do far better. And millions of voters believed him.But governing America isn't like reality TV. A few weeks ago Mr. Trump whined, \"Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\" Now, one suspects, he's saying the same thing about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy.Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.

{"id": "1922366501.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump and the Nafta Talks</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No part of Donald Trump's 2016 run for president excited crowds more than his rants against Mexico, his promises to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, to make the neighbors pay for it, and to rewrite or scrap the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rhetorically, President Trump has not stepped back very far from all that. He now says that he will build the wall first and figure how to get the money from Mexico later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understands that he won the presidency partly by making outrageous statements that kept him constantly in the news. But now that the serious business of negotiation on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is beginning, it appears that much of the craziness has been set aside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada have agreed to return to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table, and most of the objectives outlined in the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative's summary, released last week, are aimed not at destroying the 24-year-old pact but modernizing it. In many cases the U.S. is asking to open markets further on a reciprocal basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One objective is freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in agricultural products, which suggests that Canada's protected dairy and poultry markets will be on the table. The document also says the U.S. will aim for greater ease at the borders by \"streamlining\" customs procedures. A specific goal is to raise the value of goods that can enter duty-free in express-mail shipping to $800 from $50. The USTR doesn't make a big point of it, but this mail would presumably include products made in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately some items on the Trump wish list would take the region backward economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hardly surprising that the administration has made it a priority to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada. It has the same wrongheaded obsession globally. But as the Journal explained in a March 10 editorial, \"How to Think About the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Deficit,\" a current-account deficit -- which includes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- doesn't matter because it means there is a capital-account surplus. The dollars Americans spend on foreign-produced goods and services eventually must return to the U.S., usually via investments in U.S. assets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada are even less relevant. In the introduction to its summary, the USTR claims that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits have exploded.\" Yet the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners is less than 13% of the total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> represents 30% of total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Canada and Mexico are the largest export markets for the U.S., and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits are nowhere proportional. It is also worth noting that the U.S. has had a surplus in services with Mexico averaging about $9 billion a year over the past three years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the goods side -- despite all the griping about deficits with Mexico and Canada -- continental free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes U.S. exports more attractive globally. By putting production facilities in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, American auto manufacturers, for example, can turn out cars and trucks that compete on price and quality all over the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reduces the overall U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. All things being equal, the deficit would go down even more if all markets were further opened to U.S. exports. It follows that the ideal U.S. policy for an administration concerned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits would be to work to reduce all barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a world of increasingly interconnected commerce supported by free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, American protectionists have come to rely heavily on antidumping and countervailing duties. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, when exporters are alleged to be selling unfairly -- leaning on government subsidies or pricing a product below market to destroy competitors -- any of the three countries can apply duties as a remedy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, exporters can appeal those duties to an international arbitration panel. The USTR says it wants to eliminate Chapter 19 and instead send disputes to domestic courts. In the U.S. that would be the Court of International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, where the Trump administration and its supporters undoubtedly feel American companies could expect a more favorable outcome than at a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet this would also mean that when Canada and Mexico slap antidumping duties on American products, exporters will have to go to domestic courts in those countries. The result is likely to be rising protectionism in all three markets and sand in the gears of the integrated North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This can only increase divisions, beyond economics, among the three countries at a time when a strong North American alliance is crucial to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere. Mexico has adopted a welcome human-rights policy by taking a strong position against the Venezuelan dictatorship. The U.S. should do what it can to build on this common ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USTR's objectives are largely constructive. But Trump protectionists have planted a few land mines in the otherwise valuable agenda. Americans have to hope that Canada and Mexico will defend the interests that all three partners have in a free and prosperous North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19 To Help American Industry\" -- WSJ Aug. 5, 2017)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "1926409772.xml", "text": "<h2>Let's make a deal</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE TRANSCRIPT of President Trump's Jan. 27 phone conversation with President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico made fascinating reading - especially in light of what has actually happened among the United States, Mexico and their North American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partner, Canada, since the call. It's not a good-news story, but it is a could-have-been-worse story. Instead of slapping tariffs on Mexican goods, as he threatened during both the 2016 campaign and the chat with Mr. Pena Nieto, Mr. Trump agreed to talks, the goal of which is to update the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, not scrap it, as he has also threatened from time to time. What's more, the parties have set an expedited negotiation schedule, with the first meeting slated for Aug. 16 in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The specific negotiating objectives the Trump administration set forth in a July 17 report to Congress were in many respects necessary and proper. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is basically working as designed, but any quarter-century-old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact could use modification to account for new realities. It's reasonable, for example, to seek new understanding on digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in goods and services and on cross-border data flows, as the Trump objectives propose. Veterans of negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump reviled, noted similarities between the approach sketched in the July 17 paper and what had been accomplished in the TPP talks. But if hypocrisy, or reinventing the wheel, is the worst sin Mr. Trump commits on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the world will breathe a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alas, the administration also specified that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and the (smaller) one with Canada be reduced as a result of the talks, which isn't possible and wouldn't necessarily be desirable even if it were. Possibly even more counterproductive, Mr. Trump's goals include the elimination of the so-called Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which creates a special <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-based forum to challenge a member country's claims that another is selling exports below cost (\"dumping\"). This check against potentially protectionist litigation brought by U.S. industries in U.S. forums was Canada's precondition for joining the U.S.-Canada free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, upon which <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was built; and it's one reason that exports from Canada and Mexico are far less likely than those of other nations to face penalties in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eliminating Chapter 19 probably would be a dealbreaker for Canada. And why would Mr. Trump seeks its elimination? After all, as he said in that call with Mr. Pena Nieto, \"Canada is no problem . . . we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair.\" Perhaps he means the proposal as a bargaining chip, to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d for some other, more valuable concession. Or perhaps he will be willing to finesse it behind closed doors, just as he pleaded with Mr. Pena Nieto to help him wiggle out of his unwise promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall. We certainly hope the administration can be pragmatic on this point, lest it trigger the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with our neighbors that Mr. Trump once promised but so far has sidestepped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

How About Them Apples?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are President Trump's threats to terminate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement a negotiating tactic, his actual intent or throwaway phrases to feed his base and stir up media coverage? \"We are in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> (worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.

While the President may think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is \"the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made,\" our growers know it is the best apple <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal to date.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's apple industry -- valued at $4 billion at the farm-gate, or wholesale value, and estimated to create $15 billion in related downstream economic activity annually -- has thrived under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the agreement took effect, the U.S. apple industry has quadrupled and doubled its exports to Mexico and Canada, respectively. These top export markets bring $450 million in additional value to our growers and packers annually. In total, the U.S. apple industry exports a third of the 240 million bushels of apples it harvests each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> were terminated, we could see a double-digit percent tariff on our exported apples, disrupting long-established <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationships and shrinking earnings for many of our 7,500 apple growers and their employees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trading partners are like a well-stocked produce aisle. Countries have plenty of options. The U.S. is not the only nation -- or trading partner with Mexico and Canada -- growing apples. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ends, there are plenty of other nations with free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to pick from, among them Chile, New Zealand and the members of the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just because the United States isn't doing free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements doesn't mean other countries aren't,\" said Veronica Nigh, an economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, at the annual USApple Outlook and Marketing Conference this past August.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, most of the U.S. food and agriculture industry has realized success through <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

As leaders of two of the largest dairy cooperatives in the Western U.S., we have some suggestions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, American negotiators should work hard to preserve the duty-free access to Mexico that U.S. agricultural products currently enjoy. Second, they should fight to gain meaningful access to Canada's dairy market, which was excluded from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> when the agreement was first negotiated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. produces more cow's milk than any other country, 24.6 billion gallons in 2016. American dairy companies employ nearly a million people, generating direct wages of $39 billion and an overall economic footprint of more than $206 billion, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is America's single largest export dairy market, with $1.2 billion in sales last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Dairy Export Council estimates that the U.S. provides close to 75% of Mexico's dairy products, which supports nearly 30,000 American jobs. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is working well for both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dairy exports to Canada, on the other hand, face extremely high tariffs. Moreover, in February Canada implemented a state-controlled pricing policy that pays Canadian dairy farmers more than 50% more for their milk, which drives dairy prices higher in Canada than in the U.S. Simultaneously, Canada undermines global markets for dairy proteins by exporting skim-milk powder far below the global price. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations present an opportunity to stop these unfair practices, and we applaud the Trump administration's commitment to this. Most of Canadian agriculture has already embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with great success.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But fixing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't enough to keep the American dairy industry globally competitive. The most significant opportunity for dairy farmers and product manufacturers is to expand international markets, but as the U.S. focuses on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, other countries are aggressively forging new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. These arrangements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, are providing America's competitors with preferential access to a growing middle class. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement, finalized earlier this month, is a perfect example.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is one of America's primary dairy competitors. Now it is using its free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to enshrine nontariff standards such as prohibitions on the use of generic food terms such as \"parmesan\" or \"romano.\" These standards block competitors from entering those markets. The EU has completed other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Canada and Vietnam, and it is negotiating with Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand are quickly expanding their global reach, announcing that they will launch free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the Pacific Alliance of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The agreement among the remaining nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to move forward without the U.S. is only the latest in a growing string of setbacks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's absence has essentially converted slow and overly cautious countries into the most urgent deal makers of modern times. In contrast to the Trump administration's sentiments, expressed during its recent Asia trip, the U.S. ought to re-engage proactively -- and do so quickly. How can America stand alone and watch the rest of the world systematically reduce its competitive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> access?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As leaders in American food and agriculture, we ask for no subsidies or special protections -- only a fair and level playing field. This country has the most sustainable and competitive agricultural system in the world, an enduring and natural advantage. Given America's ability to provide high-quality products and meet the growing demand for dairy, entering into fair and balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements is a win for everyone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Capable U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators are working hard on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, as they should be.

{"id": "2010668188.xml", "text": "<h2>Main Street: The President Channels His Inner Hillary</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are two kinds of people in Donald Trump's world: winners and losers. In a November tweet, the president let us know in which category he thought Hillary Clinton belonged when he called her \"the worst (and biggest) loser of all time.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is she? If Mrs. Clinton is really the big loser that Mr. Trump claims, why is he now copying her <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On almost every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issue -- China, steel tariffs, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the \"stealing\" of U.S. jobs by other countries via unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices -- Mrs. Clinton long ago laid out the protectionist arguments Mr. Trump now invokes for his own policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with steel. In 2002, when George W. Bush imposed temporary tariffs on imported steel, Mrs. Clinton, then New York's junior senator, endorsed the move. Before Mr. Bush lifted the tariffs the following year, she testified to the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission to make the case that they should be extended. New York, she said, \"has seen mill after mill close as a result of dumped and subsidized imports.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few months later, NBC's Tim Russert noted that her position favoring such tariffs marked a split with her husband. \"I believe you need a steel industry in order to be competitive,\" she replied. Not all that different from Mr. Trump's line last week: \"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steel was not the only area where Sen. Clinton presaged today's Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. She also shared Mr. Trump's skepticism toward multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. While Mrs. Clinton voted for bilateral agreements with countries including Singapore and Morocco, she voted \"nay\" on the one multilateral deal that came up during her stint in the Senate: the Central America Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise with her opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Her husband brokered the deal, and as first lady she had said it was \"proving its worth.\" Yet in 2007, running for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama, she issued what would later become one of Mr. Trump's signature threats to Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I will say we will opt out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America,\" Mrs. Clinton said in Cleveland during a Democratic presidential debate with Mr. Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eight years later, during her next presidential campaign, she would add another reversal by denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she had earlier endorsed as the \"gold standard\" of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, and which Mr. Trump also opposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her second debate with Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton called for the creation of a \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\" In the third presidential debate, she made it personal:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He mentioned China,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state. Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, almost everything Mr. Trump now says on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> echoes what Mrs. Clinton has been saying for years -- or at least since she began running for president. Whether it's complaining about companies that move their factories overseas, \"getting tough\" on China, or calling for a \"time out\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, on this issue it's hard to see much daylight between the two.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This isn't so surprising on Mrs. Clinton's end. Her growing protectionism reflected her party's growing hostility to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and markets, as shown by both Mr. Obama and Bernie Sanders. In the Obama years, the policies that flowed from this approach gave us 2% growth, which was posited as the new normal. Surely this connection between anemic growth and the champions of protectionism ought to give Mr. Trump pause.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, if there is a difference between the two 2016 presidential contenders on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, it is that Mrs. Clinton's protectionist rhetoric has always seemed pegged more to primaries and elections than principle. Mr. Trump, alas, genuinely appears to believe the costs of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war are minimal at worst. Thus the spectacle of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross holding up a Campbell's soup can, suggesting that the tariffs will cost the consumer no more than a extra half-cent here and there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reality of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that many countries do cheat, through government subsidies, tariff and nontariff import barriers, intellectual-property theft and the like. The more difficult reality, however, is that no one has yet found a way to punish cheaters without inflicting more harm on innocent buyers and sellers in one's own economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even for a born salesman, that position would be difficult to sell politically. But it's still better than embracing Hillary's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p>\n"}
{"id": "2062740122.xml", "text": "<h2>A Left Turn in Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico entered a brave old world on Sunday by electing former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a six-year term as president. The 64-year-old left-wing populist has lost twice, in 2006 and 2012, but this time he won against two weak candidates while promising more moderate policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official vote count wasn't available late Sunday evening, but exit polls gave Mr. Lopez Obrador a large enough margin to call him the winner. Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) is expected to finish a distant second with Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Jose Antonio Meade in third. Early indications suggest the president-elect's coattails will make his Morena front, which includes smaller parties, the largest coalition in both legislative chambers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campaign was marred by violence at the local level. But kudos to Mexico's National Electoral Institute, which handled 157,000 polling stations and some nine million more registered voters than in 2012. The largely peaceful vote is another milestone in Mexico's progress as a democracy since the days when Mr. Lopez Obrador worked for the PRI that ran the country as a one-party state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO, as Mr. Lopez Obrador is known, is a career politician from the oil-rich southern state of Tabasco. But in this race he ran as an outsider, pledging to end corruption, upend the establishment in politics and economics -- which he called \"mafias of power\" -- and use subsidies to lift the poor, especially in rural areas. He said he would make Mexicans better off by assigning the state a larger role in the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO has moderated his rhetoric from the decades when he railed against private investment in energy and other economic competition as Mexico shifted toward free markets. But his Morena party, which he founded in 2014, is home to many who are nostalgic for the not-so-glorious days of PRI dominance. They have never accepted the country's transition to an open economy with more political and institutional transparency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lopez Obrador's challenge will be keeping those supporters happy without derailing Mexico's economic progress under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Except for some of Mexico's crony capitalists, entrepreneurial Mexico largely opposed his candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most extreme fear is that AMLO will attempt to consolidate power a la Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. But Mexico has made considerable economic and political progress in 30 years of reform presidencies. The Mexican government doesn't hold the oil power that Chavez had, and a Mexican president is constrained by his country's obligations under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- unless President Trump tears it up. Financial markets will also vote on AMLO's government each day through foreign-exchange markets and the value of the peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. can help by completing a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal as soon as possible. Mr. Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric played into the hands of Mr. Lopez Obrador's left-wing nationalism, but troubles in Mexico will inevitably spill across the border -- wall or no wall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO's anti-corruption pledge will also be tested by how he handles the country's already weak rule of law. He has said he will amnesty drug traffickers and not investigate corrupt politicians for past crimes. His government's cooperation with the U.S. on regional drug and immigration enforcement will also be important to watch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This election has dramatically altered Mexican politics. The once-dominant PRI is now a minor party. Its losses are a repudiation of current President Enrique Pena Nieto's government. The center-right PAN is now the largest opposition party in Congress, but it too is weakened and will have to rebuild after divisive internal battles that undermined Mr. Anaya's candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some 30% of registered voters were millennials, who have no memory of the one-party state of Mr. Lopez Obrador's youth. They are dissatisfied with Mexico's status quo and have voted for a change. Let's hope the change they get isn't back to the future of state economic control and peso devaluation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

Specifically, these will raise the minimum \"local\" North American content needed for a vehicle to enter the U.S. market tariff free, from 62.5 percent to 75 percent, and require that between 40 and 45 percent be produced by workers earning at least $16 per hour. The former responds to the reality of increased leakage of Chinese parts into the Mexican end of the North American supply chain; the latter constitutes what may be the first-ever industry-specific international minimum-wage agreement. The actual impact is difficult to foresee, but the spirit of these measures is clear enough: They express a zero-sum, \"managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" mind-set, not a genuine commitment to an increasingly free flow of goods and services, which the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> embodied.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that sense, the other major change Mr. Trump's team negotiated, a 16-year life span for the deal, reviewable and extendable by the parties every six years, represents a possible saving grace. It allows for a future administration to re-liberate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> if so minded. For now, the challenge is to get Canada, the third member of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, to sign on, so as to minimize the disruption to regional supply chains. On the whole, Canada has little to fear from the new auto rules, given that it is already a high-wage producer. By giving Canada a Friday deadline to decide and threatening auto tariffs if it says no, Mr. Trump has made it hard for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to participate without enduring a gratuitous humiliation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, Mr. Trudeau may well swallow his pride and his misgivings, because the U.S. market is simply too crucial to the Canadian economy. Then it will be up to Congress to approve or disapprove Mr. Trump's handiwork \u2014 including all the details still to be ironed out among the parties. When lawmakers face that task, they should do so bearing in mind that this proposed deal represents ambiguous improvement over the economic status quo and constitutes a victory for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> only in a relative sense \u2014 compared with the far more radical and costly protectionist policies Mr. Trump threatened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Mr. Lighthizer will need a large majority of GOP votes to pass any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, especially if Democrats run the House next year. Why would Democrats give Mr. Trump a victory? Mr. Lighthizer's Mexico deal is worse than current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in many ways, so the business community is going to be ambivalent at best.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the legal question of whether the President can withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> without Congressional assent.

{"id": "2116057499.xml", "text": "<h2>On NAFTA, Trump saves us from himself</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s an old theme of movies, TV dramas and even cartoons: A nasty villain ties an innocent damsel to a railroad track, and her terror mounts as a train hurtles toward her \u2014 until at the last moment, a hero comes to the rescue. It\u2019s also a regular theme of the current administration. The twist is that the villain and the hero are the same person: Donald Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, christened the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, is the product of his peculiar approach to disputes. First he heaps scorn on the status quo. Then he emits a torrent of demands and threats, some of which could be disastrous, generating anxiety and uncertainty. Finally, he extracts some modest changes, for better or worse, and invites the praise of a grateful nation. (In the case of North Korea, he then proceeds to fall in love with his negotiating partner, but that may be a one-time fancy.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a candidate, Trump reserved special disgust for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which he called \u201cthe worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever.\u201d He vowed that he would withdraw if Mexico and Canada wouldn\u2019t accept major changes. As president, he repeated his threats, raising fears among automakers and other companies that their carefully constructed transnational supply chains would be tied in knots.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But last month, the administration reached an agreement with the Mexican government, allowing Trump to crow about his deal-making prowess. \u201cA lot of people thought we\u2019d never get here,\u201d he said. He also indicated that if the Canadians didn\u2019t want to accept the same terms, they were welcome to climb onto an Arctic iceberg and float away. The Oct. 1 deadline the U.S. imposed on Canada raised the prospect that the whole package could collapse, to the detriment of the entire North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Commentary: Why our small manufacturing firm supports Trump on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \u00bb</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Letting Trump conduct negotiations with foreign governments is like leaving teenagers unsupervised at home for a weekend. You don\u2019t expect to find the place in better condition when you return; you just hope it hasn\u2019t burned down. It came as a relief that Trump averted the disaster he had threatened to unleash.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important fact about the new version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that it would preserve more and destroy less than Trump led his followers to believe. But making a few changes and giving it a new name lets him strike a heroic pose.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress still has to decide whether to approve the agreement. But in general, it would preserve the North American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone, with zero tariffs on the vast majority of goods crossing national borders. Companies still would be allowed to invest, operate and shift production according to economic logic rather than government-created barriers. Special visas that allow professionals in dozens of different occupations to move from one country to another would be retained, despite Trump\u2019s notorious aversion to foreigners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some actual upgrades, as Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes. U.S. companies and individuals holding copyrights, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>marks and patents would gain safeguards against piracy. Pharmaceutical companies that have to spend fortunes to prove the safety and efficacy of their medicines wouldn\u2019t have to worry about generic rivals reaping the rewards. Canada would have to grant more access to its dairy market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Editorial: Trading up: This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rewrite should boost Midwest exports \u00bb</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of what the administration got would impede commerce, restrict businesses and harm consumers. By 2023, at least 40 percent of the components in every vehicle would have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. The administration wanted that provision not to lift up Mexican factory workers, who generally make far less, but to force manufacturers to move production out of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans usually oppose minimum wage increases \u2014 which is what this mandate would amount to \u2014 but if the change were to cause layoffs in Mexico, the Trump administration would count it as an achievement. Hufbauer worries that the precedent will mean that \u201cDemocrats will put minimum wages in every future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.\u201d It would, of course, raise the price of cars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal also would weaken protections for U.S. businesses operating in many sectors of the Mexican economy, making them vulnerable to onerous regulations that diminish or destroy the value of their property.Why would the administration want to expose American firms to greater risk in Mexico? Simple: to discourage them from investing in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the outcome could have been much worse. In this case, it\u2019s good to see the damsel escape from the tracks before the train runs her over. And let\u2019s just forget who put her there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/chapman.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>schapman@chicagotribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @SteveChapman13</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Steve Chapman</p>\n"}

{"id": "2125599618.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico Should Not Consent to Do Washington\u2019s Dirty Work</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A migrant caravan from Honduras is marching north through Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump had declared he would suspend aid to Honduras, if its government failed to disband it. It didn\u2019t disband it. He threatened to upend the recently announced new free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada if Mexico didn\u2019t stop it, and it didn\u2019t. And he ordered deployment of at least 800 Army troops to militarize the United States southern border and to the border, but in April he sent the National Guard with no effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The caravan started on Oct. 12 when a small group of Hondurans left San Pedro Sula, one of the most violent cities in the world. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew on an emergency trip to Mexico on Oct. 19, violence broke out on the Mexico-Guatemalan border , as hundreds of Hondurans, mainly women and children, tore down the gates on the southern side of the border, rushed toward the Mexican side, and were met with tear gas. Nearly 7,000 trekkers eventually entered Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They regrouped and continued their exodus north, escorted by the federal police and aided with water and medicines by Mexican townspeople along the way. Other caravans are reported to be underway. Does this migratory and diplomatic crisis have a solution?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe not, but there is at least an explanation for it, which lies in another question. Why, after all his huffing and puffing, did President Trump accept a watered-down version of a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, known now as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows for sure, but after nearly 40 years of being intimately involved, as an academic and public official, with these situations, I can offer an informed guess: The United States gave up most of its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> demands in exchange for a confidential commitment by Mexico to do Washington\u2019s dirty work against would-be immigrants and refugees. Of course, this is speculation, and the evidence is all circumstantial.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From experience, though, I know how both countries, for diverse reasons, tried always to keep different issues on the bilateral agenda separate and not mix them together. In an ideal world today, that is how it would be, but not with Mr. Trump. These American bureaucratic traditions, which Mexico always counted on to maintain stability and sensibility in the relationship, have been overturned. Immigration and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have become intimately linked, at least in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. Therein lies part of the origins of the current caravan crisis. It is not just Trumpian electioneering.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sept. 29, Mexico, Canada and the United States finally reached a deal on a revised version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that was promptly rebranded by Mr. Trump with a new name largely because it doesn\u2019t have much new content. The president achieved far less than he originally sought.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His initial goals \u2014 reducing the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, bringing automobile jobs back to the United States \u2014 are unlikely to be accomplished any time soon, if at all. He acquiesced to a deal that fell far short of his ambitions. And he hardly mentions it on the campaign trail as one of his signature triumphs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it seems probable that Mr. Trump\u2019s ultimate goal, at the end of the day, was to obtain Mexican cooperation on security at the border and immigration from Central America. As he tweeted : \u201cThe assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> or the USMCA ... Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border.\u201d For now, it hasn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump himself mentioned this bilateral cooperation as part of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. At a White House news conference on Oct. 1 , when flaunting the agreement, he said it explicitly: \u201cYeah, we talked about it (the wall, border security). With Mexico, we talked about it. It was a big part. And certain things and certain understandings are had. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to mix it up too much. This is a very big deal and very good deal for everybody. But border security and security generally is a very big factor.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was probably referring to the two main American demands on Mexico that have been made public in the United States press over the past weeks. They are ominous for Mexico and ignoble for the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Washington has been pressing the outgoing president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto , to sign what is known as a Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States. This entails Mexico processing Central American asylum claims locally, and allowing American authorities to deny any claim for asylum in the United States, since Mexico would be considered a \u201csafe third country.\u201d With violence in Mexico at its highest point in decades , and many Central Americans being murdered there in recent years, it is hard to see the merits of such a certification by Washington, much less its acceptance by Mexico. So far, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has resisted that pressure; the caravan is moving freely through Mexico .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can suppose, however, that the incoming president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, may have less leeway, especially if this arrangement was a precondition for a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Mr. Trump has stated that the Honduran caravan members must request asylum first in Mexico without any legal basis for doing so . Mexico has no reason for proceeding this way, except for United States pressure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, and most important, since 2014 under President Obama, and now more than ever, Washington has pressured Mexico to shut down as much as possible of its southern border \u2014 in a nutshell, to do its dirty work. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has reluctantly gone along, but the cost for Mexico is rising, and he is soon to be no longer in charge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is why it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Trump administration conditioned its acceptance of a diluted new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on Mexico\u2019s acceptance of more cooperation, or complicity, with the United States, for keeping Central Americans, be they refugees, economic migrants, or a combination of both, from reaching the United States border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is what Mr. Pompeo said in Mexico: Stop the Hondurans from reaching the United States border. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has insinuated that he won\u2019t maintain this policy. Knowing him on and off for more than 30 years, I think the chances are that if he is left no choice, having agreed to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>/immigration <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-off, he might cave in to American pressure, despite his displeasure and current denials. He has staked too much on USMCA as a source of economic stability for his incoming government to put it at risk simply because of Central American refugees. But deporting thousands of Central Americans or placing them by force in refugee camps would be intolerable for his supporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is obviously a great deal of electoral distraction in all of this, and Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster on these matters has proved meaningless in the past. Still, these pressures on immigration, coupled with the rise of deportations of Mexicans from the United States heartland, bode not well for Mexico nor for the United States. These approaches are harmful for Mexico, and unworthy of the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pompeo\u2019s flash visit to Mexico City confirmed what has been known for months. Immigration is at the top of the Trump agenda with Mexico (and other countries); this approach is damaging to Mexico, Central America and the United States. The new government in Mexico, a hypothetical new majority in the House of Representatives, and hundreds of thousands of Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees should all be aware of this.

Mr. Trump seems to think that the chances of passing new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> improve if he presents Democrats with the ultimatum of voting for new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or confronting the damage of terminating current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't how Democrats are likely to see it.

Roosevelt proclaimed in his first inaugural address that there might have to be a \"temporary departure\" from \"the normal balance of executive and legislative authority\" so that he could wield in domestic policy \"broad executive power\" as great as would be given to him were America \"invaded by a foreign foe.\" Such was the allure of unfettered executive power, the Studebaker automobile company of South Bend, Ind., marketed a model called the Dictator.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Constitution vests in Congress the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\" For decades, however, Congress has granted vast <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> discretion to presidents, for reasons of sloth (setting policy is work), prudence (taking responsibility is risky) and ideology (executive discretion is modern; the separation of powers is an anachronistic impediment to energetic government). Today, however, there is growing legislative resistance to some broad powers that presidents possess because legislators improvidently \u2014 and, arguably, unconstitutionally \u2014 delegated them to presidents, particularly regarding international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Those powers include the presidential imposition of taxes \u2014 which tariffs are \u2014 paid by Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) have introduced legislation that would, they say \u2014 sacrificing candor to political delicacy \u2014 \"better align\" Section 232 of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Expansion Act of 1962 with its \"original intent,\" which was to enable presidential responses \"to genuine threats to national security.\" The senators would require the Defense Department to justify the \"national security\" basis for tariffs. Imagine the generals and admirals today trying to explain the threat posed by imported automobiles and auto parts, or by steel and aluminum imported from nations (six of the top 10 sources of imported steel) that have mutual-defense agreements with the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1903, Winston Churchill, then 28, warned (this is from Andrew Roberts's magnificent new biography) that by embracing protectionism, the Conservative Party would \"cause the lobbies to be crowded with the touts of protected industries.\" The Trump administration's protectionism has turned the Commerce Department \u2014 it is now an impediment to the activity that its name denotes \u2014 into a bazaar for such touts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) raises an issue that implicates constitutional issues that are even more fundamental than those addressed by the Portman-Jones-Ernst measure. President Trump might try to force congressional ratification of his United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) replacement of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement by terminating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This would confront Congress with an unpalatable choice: Embrace the USMCA or live without an agreement and with economic chaos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toomey correctly argues that Congress cannot delegate the power to repeal statutes. Statutes implementing congressional-executive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>explicitly authorize presidents to take certain actions, which make implausible</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>implicit delegation of the power to terminate such agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president might argue that he can unilaterally terminate treaties (although no president did so until 1927), and that congressional-executive agreements decisively resemble treaties because presidential initiative is paramount. However, the president's power in foreign relations is plenary</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>except regarding commerce, where the president has no independent power and where the Constitution's commerce clause establishes Congress's primacy. Presidents can make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>treaties that must be consented to by two-thirds of the Senate. But congressional-executive agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are authorized by statutes passed by both houses of Congress, and must be terminated by statutes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1952, during the Korean War, the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman's claim that his inherent and implied powers as commander in chief legitimated his seizure of steel mills to prevent disruption by labor disputes. In a concurring opinion, Justice Robert H. Jackson said that presidential powers \"fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress,\" and presidential power is at its \"lowest ebb\" when the president acts against the \"express or implied will of Congress.\" That will is expressed, not merely implied, in congressional-executive agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the Studebaker company expired in 1966, a Dictator model is displayed in South Bend's Studebaker Museum.

His main trouble has come from the Trumpian exceptions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, immigration and polarizing temperament that motivate many of his supporters. Whether he can overcome that seeming contradiction may determine whether he can win what on present trends looks like an uphill climb to re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Trump will no doubt tell Congress in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, his main achievement has been re-energizing what had been a long but weak and fading economic expansion. As the nearby table shows, the economy nearly dipped into recession at the end of 2015 and early 2016 before recovering to its 2% Obama-era trend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Growth accelerated in 2017 amid deregulation and especially the end to the Obama harassment of business. The GOP Congress and Mr. Trump repealed no fewer than 16 costly Obama-era rules. Growth accelerated again to more than 3% on an annual basis in 2018 after tax reform\u2014and may end up as the first calendar year above 3% since 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax reform was mediocre on the individual side, with tax credits that redistributed income but did nothing for growth. But the tax-rate cuts for corporations and pass-through businesses were aimed specifically at the biggest weakness of the Obama expansion: capital investment, which surged in 2018.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has led to productivity gains that should spur large wage increases if they continue. The labor market is as healthy as it's been since the mid-2000s and maybe the 1990s. Average hourly earnings in January were up 3.2% year over year, the workweek was up 0.5%, and overall employment rose 1.7%. With inflation heading below 2%, economist Ed Hyman calculates that real wage gains are already nearly 4%. So much for the claim that tax reform hasn't helped workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This economic progress fulfills the main promise Mr. Trump made to his working-class supporters, and keeping it going has to be his priority. With the Federal Reserve now \"patient\" on raising interest rates, the biggest growth obstacle is Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs have hurt some companies and industries willy-nilly, but the biggest harm has been the uncertainty of what comes next. Mr. Trump thinks car tariffs are \"leverage\" in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, but they are also a reason to delay investment until supply-chain and input costs become clear. Tariffs act like Obama regulation as an economic wet blanket, as numerous CEOs attest on their earnings calls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump can help guard against an economic slump in the next two years by stepping back from his 2018 burst of protectionism. First, get as good a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal as he can with China, declare victory, and spend the next two years monitoring how well Beijing abides by its terms. Second, withdraw the threat of car tariffs on Europe as he negotiates a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the European Union. The U.S. economy can't grow at 3% or higher if China and Europe aren't growing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal awaiting a vote in Congress. Mr. Trump will no doubt urge Democrats to support it on Tuesday, but he can't force Speaker Nancy Pelosi to do so. What he can control is whether to hurt himself and the U.S. economy by withdrawing from the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> pact, which is in force until the new one is ratified. Mr. Trump's threat to do so merely gives Mrs. Pelosi more reason to shelve the pact since she knows any economic harm will accrue to Mr. Trump as President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With an enhanced GOP Senate majority of 53, Mr. Trump can keep adding to another achievement\u2014judicial nominees who are remaking the federal bench in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We wish Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg well, but if illness forces her retirement Mr. Trump could cement what the last three GOP Presidents did not: an originalist majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time in decades.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Democrats running the House, Mr. Trump can't expect much legislation worth doing. All the more given the sharp Democratic left turn on economics and the culture. Democrats will try to tempt him into a tax increase in return for infrastructure spending, or perhaps the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal, but this would undermine the economic growth essential to have any chance at re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An immigration deal would be a signature achievement, if Democrats agreed. But to move them politically, Mr. Trump has to get off his Donald-one-note rhetoric of a \"border crisis.\" He has to frame the issue more broadly in a way that promises legalization for the Dreamers and others to put pressure on Democrats. He needs to offer an incentive for Hispanics to lobby Democrats to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Russia probe aside, a restrictionist-only immigration policy has done the most harm to Mr. Trump in the first two years. The early travel ban was a legal and political fiasco that cost him support; the family separation mess hurt Republicans in the midterms; and insisting on money for the border wall put him in a box canyon that led to his recent defeat over the government shutdown. Mr. Trump needs to make a bigger immigration offer to overcome that losing record.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump faces a difficult re-election despite his economic success because he hasn't expanded the coalition that elected him. The traditional suburban Republicans and independents who swung to his side in the final days of 2016 were willing to give him a chance rather than vote for Hillary Clinton. She won't be on the ballot in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats may give Mr. Trump a chance by running too far to the left, but voters may take even that risk unless Mr. Trump can point to prosperity and give more Americans more confidence in him personally. By now we've learned that last point is beyond our counsel.</p>\n"}

A former economy minister for Mrs. Kirchner, Mr. Kicillof today calls himself a Keynesian. But while working in the Kirchner government he was known for hard-left antimarket activism and fiery rants fomenting envy and hatred among Argentines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kicillof gave a speech titled \"How to confront neoliberalism and not die trying: Argentina, Mexico and the new conservative wave in Latin America,\" at the national university in Mexico City. But he also called on two powerful Mexican senators of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador's Morena Party and had meetings with government officials.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his team were serious about maintaining Mexico's image as a destination for capital, they would have ducked Mr. Kicillof when he came to town. That they didn't is reason to turn up the worry meter and pay greater attention to the trading relationships that link the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is still a free country and the right of Mr. Kicillof's hosts\u2014who happen to be among the country's most vociferous AMLO supporters\u2014to provide a platform in the public square for his ideas remains secure. But for a government that claims to want to prove its rule-of-law bona fides, the Kicillof visit looks like a foolish, self-inflicted wound.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to believe it was a misstep. An alternative theory is that the government brought in Mr. Kicillof to plow ground for the AMLO agenda\u2014a k a the \"fourth transformation\"\u2014which the Argentine praised during his visit. The kirchneristas left office in 2015 in shame, having destroyed the country. Center-right Argentine President Mauricio Macri is still struggling to steady the economy, and Mr. Kicillof has no intention of letting the crisis go to waste.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The symbolism embedded in the Kicillof visit isn't lost on investors. They know that Mexico has been working to modernize for a quarter-century and has made important progress. They also know that kirchernismo would drag it backward as it did Argentina.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is a wake-up call for the Trump administration. With international socialists putting Mexico in play, the appropriate U.S. response is to deepen engagement with its southern neighbor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only Mexico's wacky hard left could see Mr. Kicillof's legacy of no-holds-barred populism as successful because it irresponsibly expanded social programs. Mr. Kicillof was part of a disastrous Argentine agenda that ran up huge budget deficits, pressured the central bank to print money, and destroyed the country's investment profile. Mr. Kicillof preached against property rights and applauded debt default and the confiscation of foreign assets. Locals weren't off limits: Mrs. Kirchner nationalized private pension accounts in Argentine banks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his daily news conferences, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador can seem invincible. From his moral high horse he scolds the press, denigrates the entrepreneurial class, and scoffs at the law. But his power rests on his high approval rating, which is unlikely to be sustained if investors flee the country and the peso collapses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reality is recognized by the practical AMLO, and it is why, despite his disdain for market economics, he has so far been forced to respect the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which remains in effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't, as some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> skeptics suggest, a handout to Mexico. It is an economic and geopolitical tool that modernizers on both sides of the border have used for a quarter-century to advance and lock in gains in Mexican economic freedom. Retaining it, or passing President Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, is crucial to holding on to that progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is voluntary exchange that is not only mutually beneficial in economic terms but also facilitates the flow of ideas and goodwill between nations. Isolation, by contrast, creates the conditions in which demagogues gain power. By shoring up the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, Washington can help Mexicans beat back the dangerous left-wing populism that Mr. Kicillof represents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You wouldn't guess any of this from listening to President Trump's continual bully-pulpit assaults against Mexico as a trading partner, or by watching Congress dither over passing the president's updated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some hope emerged Friday, when the Trump administration</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>announced</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>it has come to an agreement with Canada and Mexico to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed last year.

The USMCA's constructive modernizations of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \u2014 the enormous digital economy did not exist in 1994 \u2014 are, Toomey says, \"mostly taken from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" which was negotiated by the Obama administration, and for that reason was anathema to Trump. His scrapping of the TPP was a gift to China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA ends free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in automobiles and auto parts with Mexico: By imposing impossible minimum-wage requirements on Mexican factories, the USMCA guarantees that cars and parts will be subject to tariffs \u2014 taxes paid by U.S. consumers. The USMCA also compels Mexico to change its labor laws to promote unionization. And the provision that the USMCA expires in 16 years is, Toomey says, \"designed to have a chilling effect on investment.\" He notes that members of Congress who have opposed every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement before this one support it, as does the AFL-CIO, which generally opposes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's substance is regrettable. The process that produced it was even more so because it was lawless.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agreements that fully comply with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority (TPA) cannot be amended and can be passed by a simple majority. But the USMCA did not comply: The implementing legislation was not submitted to Congress 30 days before a committee or floor vote on it, a requirement necessary if Congress is to perform its constitutional duty to establish <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Also, the TPA requires that the implementing legislation contain only provisions \"strictly necessary or appropriate\" for implementation. Otherwise, the TPA's expedited process could be used to sneak extraneous matters into law without adequate scrutiny, or possible opposition through amendment, or a 60-vote threshold. But for the first time ever, implementing legislation contained appropriations, $843 million, including $50 million for salaries and expenses for the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative, which was designated an \"emergency.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate and its once-formidable Finance Committee are, Toomey believes, being \"marginalized\" and made \"irrelevant\" as the executive wields authority delegated to it by Congress \u2014 but without Congress insisting on compliance with the terms of the delegation. The question, Toomey says, is: \"Are we willing to enforce our own law that governs the proceedings of this body?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) felt similarly in December when Congress \"passed a $1.4 trillion spending extravaganza, complete with half a trillion dollars in tax cuts and a bevy of favors for special interests \u2014 all without debate and without committee consideration, based on decisions made by the bill's sponsors over a weekend.\" The $300 billion \"Cadillac tax,\" a restraint on lavish employer-provided health plans, was repealed. This demonstrated that Congress cannot repeal Obamacare but will not pay for it. Amendments were not allowed, debate was limited to 90 minutes, and the Senate voted on the bill less than three days after it was unveiled. \"Senate leadership clearly didn't want it to be understood or discussed,\" Cassidy said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 116th Congress, now in its second year, there have been, Toomey notes, votes on just 20 amendments \u2014 one was a \"sense of the Senate\" legal nullity, four were \"noncontroversial or largely devoid of substance,\" six \"were killed using a procedural maneuver,\" and none of the other nine \"came close to passage.\" The Finance Committee has held one substantive markup in 13 months.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's institutional vandalism is partially explained, although not excused, by the breadth and depth of his ignorance concerning the manners and mores of a republic. The Senate's self-degradation is even more depressing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n"}

Ackerman is editor in chief of the Mexican Law Review and director of the University Program on Democracy, Justice and Society at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not underestimate the enormous symbolic and strategic importance of Wednesday\u00b4s meeting between President Trump and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump was elected in 2016 on an explicitly anti-Mexican platform. He called Mexicans \"rapists\" and threatened to end the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) while pledging to build an \"impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall.\" In contrast, L\u00f3pez Obrador, as a presidential candidate, toured the United States in 2017 to express his solidarity with Mexican migrants threatened by Trump's draconian immigration policies. The Mexican leader called Trump a \"neo-fascist\" and presented international human rights claims against the White House both in the United Nations and at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once L\u00f3pez Obrador was elected president in 2018, the expectation was that the two heads of state would inevitably collide, ruining a long history of constructive bilateral collaboration. Surprisingly, Trump and the Mexican president have in fact gotten along exceptionally well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L\u00f3pez Obrador made the first move. The Mexican leader could have easily used his political capital \u2014 after a landslide victory \u2014 to rally the masses against the bully in Washington. Instead, he immediately put pen to paper and wrote a letter to Trump in which he proposed \"a new stage in the relationship between Mexico and the United States based on mutual respect and the identification of areas of understanding and common interests.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump followed suit. Instead of railing against a new \"radical leftist\" president south of the border, he called the Mexican leader to congratulate him warmly on election day. Trump then immediately sent a high-level delegation to meet with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u00b4s transition team in Mexico City and quickly got to work to continue bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has of course continued to insult Mexicans and immigrants while applying pressure on the Mexican government to control the northern flow of migrants. But the president has not taken a single action against the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration or violated Mexican sovereignty \u2014 not a small feat given the White House's tendency toward neo-imperialist policies, such as with Venezuela and Iran, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The biggest risk to the bilateral relationship was the possible end of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Trump promised time and again to end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, calling it a \"job-killing failure.\" And L\u00f3pez Obrador, and the Mexican left in general, had for decades blamed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for ruining the countryside and fracturing national industrial policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico\u00b4s previous president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, salvaged negotiations in 2017 by succumbing to Washington's whims. He was desperate to avoid the collapse of the economy on the eve of the 2018 elections, since this would have ruined any possibility of his party keeping the presidency. But once L\u00f3pez Obrador won, the alarms sounded, since it was not clear how Trump would respond to a stronger president interested in defending his country's sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miraculously, the two presidents quickly cut a deal, and the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) was born. Both Trump and L\u00f3pez Obrador put aside ideology for a moment and worked together to hammer out a new version of an agreement that enables the increasingly integrated North American economy to grow and prosper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is the United States' third most important trading partner and the United States is Mexico\u00b4s first \u2014 $670 billion in goods of services cross the border each year. Neither country could afford to simply end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with nothing to replace it. Both sides therefore compromised on key issues, Mexico on domestic content of auto manufacturing, and the United States on Mexican oil sovereignty, all in the interest of regional development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had not been replaced with the USMCA, the prospects for an economic recovery after the covid-19 pandemic would be even more dire. If Trump and L\u00f3pez Obrador had fallen into the temptation of Twitter fights, political grandstanding and competitive one-upmanship, both the United States and Mexican economies would be on the brink.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, reason and long-term self-interest have prevailed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L\u00f3pez Obrador chose Washington for his first foreign visit since being elected two years ago as a testament to the deep economic and cultural ties that unite the two nations. Fears that Trump will use the historic meeting to boost his reelection campaign or humiliate the Mexican president are misplaced. They underestimate the dignity and the political savvy of L\u00f3pez Obrador, who will insist on being treated as an equal and will not hesitate to defend the rights and interests of Mexicans on both sides of the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stark contrast between the politics and ideology of the two leaders only highlights the importance of the summit. Despite the forces pulling the two countries apart, our mutual bonds are even stronger.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2549391236.xml", "text": "<h2>The Keystone XL Goes to Court; The pipeline's owner wants $15 billion to redress Biden's arbitrary permit withdrawal.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The climate lobby cheered in January when President Biden revoked the State Department's 2017 presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. Now the bill is coming due, and U.S. taxpayers may have to pay.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Keystone owner TC Energy last week filed a Notice of Intent to take legal action against the U.S. government for withdrawing the permit. In a press release the company called the decision a \"breach\" of North American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> obligations. In June TC Energy officially canceled the Keystone XL and took a $1.81 billion writedown. It wants $15 billion in damages as part of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> legacy claim under the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has never lost before a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> arbitration panel. But TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) has a good case. To prevail, TC Energy will have to show that it had good reason in March 2020 to believe that its $9 billion investment was protected by the U.S. permit when it announced that it would \"proceed with construction.\" In other words, that it had a logical expectation it would be allowed to complete the pipeline and operate it. After years of environmental and other reviews, that was a reasonable conclusion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Biden's reversal on his first day in office was also irregular. Normally a company would have a chance to make its case, and the Administration would engage in a review. But Mr. Biden wanted theater for the environmental lobby, which trumped respect for an investor's right to be treated fairly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TC Energy isn't challenging the Administration's climate views, and its suit isn't about reviving a project that promised to carry 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude a day to the Gulf Coast. The same oil will now be carried on trains, trucks and ships, albeit with greater risks of a spill and greater use of carbon energy. The company merely wants compensation for lost investment that is tantamount to expropriation under international law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Biden's cancellation raises the broader question of whether investor protections in the U.S. now blow with the wind, changing when administrations do. That view will be reinforced by the decision of former U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer to kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s investor-state dispute mechanism in the USMCA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer argued that the protection was a subsidy for Americans to invest abroad. The TC Energy case shows how wrong that was. Without a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> arbitration panel, Canadian investors will be helpless against Biden environmental policy since a lawsuit against a U.S. President in U.S. domestic courts has little chance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canadians and Mexicans retain investor protections under the Trans-Pacific Partnership <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, which the U.S. did not join. But cross-border investments between the U.S. and its largest trading partner are now unprotected. Treating foreign investment like a banana republic would isn't a good look for America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Keystone XL Goes to Court</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2574965600.xml", "text": "<h2>Chinese Leaders Are Having Fun With Us. Who Can Blame Them?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone who says that China's President Xi Jinping does not have a sense of humor is definitely not following the news from the Pacific these days.China last week applied for membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that was originally negotiated by President Barack Obama precisely to counter China's economic power in the Pacific. Unfortunately, President Donald Trump promptly tore it up rather than learn what it was about and get Congress to ratify it, and the Democrats have since then made no move to revive the deal, known as the TPP.Beijing applying to join the TPP is the diplomatic equivalent of the U.S. asking to be a member of China's \"belt and road\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment initiative in Asia, or Russia applying to be a member of the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because it controls part of the Arctic north of Canada. In other words, a deliciously mischievous ploy.But it's a ploy that exposes a real weakness in U.S. foreign policymaking toward China, which has become the biggest challenger to American pre-eminence in setting the rules of today's international system in both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and diplomacy.China's announcement came the day after Britain, the U.S. and Australia took geopolitical competition with China to a new level by announcing a historic security pact to help Australia deploy the most advanced nuclear-powered submarines, to counter Beijing's growing naval clout in the Asia-Pacific region.But we need a strategy for not just containing China with submarines that could take years before going on patrol. We need a strategy for changing China's behavior today, which is what the TPP was partly designed to do.China was never formally excluded from the TPP by its Obama administration designers. But the message to Beijing was: If you want to be part of this American-crafted 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, you have to play by our rules. That's why reformers in China were intrigued by the TPP -- they saw it as a lever to open the Chinese system -- and hard-liners feared it more than submarines.But after the U.S.-U.K.-Australia sub deal, the Chinese obviously said to themselves: \"Let's have some fun. After the Americans were so stupid as to never join the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that they designed to keep us out, America in and its Pacific allies close, the 11 other partners went ahead without them. They even renamed it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). So, let's try to use the attraction of easier access to China's giant market to take over the TPP on our terms instead of America's! And what better way to counter the American submarine deal with Australia?\"It was a brilliant move. As The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday: \"A decade ago, it was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club led by the U.S. seeking to limit the influence of China's economic model. Now Washington is out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Beijing wants in -- as the group's biggest member.\"While China's admittance is not likely anytime soon (it requires unanimous consent of the members), just by applying Beijing is exposing how unserious the American far left and far right are when it comes to China. They rail against Beijing's human rights policy and then they block one of America's most effective tools to nudge -- and that is the most we can ever do -- China toward more transparency and the rule of law, i.e., TPP.\"Reformers in China carefully monitored the original TPP negotiations with the hope that China joining the TPP could lead to domestic reforms,\" said James McGregor, the chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide, Greater China. \"Those days are gone. In its new bid to join, China will likely try to use the lure of its huge market to entice the other members to live with China meeting some TPP requirements while muddying others.\"What makes this Chinese maneuver more ridiculous is that Trump was so ignorant about the contents of the TPP before he tore it up -- his main objection was surely that Obama had negotiated it -- that when he was first asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015, Trump incorrectly suggested that China was in it from the start. Trump was just ahead of his time!But Trump's foolishness had a lot of tacit support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their knee-jerk opposition to the pact -- even though it was designed by Obama to address all the core labor and environmental issues that the left did not like about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.Let's go to the videotape and recall what the Obama team -- not Trump, not the G.O.P. -- O-B-A-M-A -- built into the original TPP, which also included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.One of the largest multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets. It detailed intellectual property protections for the newest and most advanced American-made tech products -- like free access for all cloud computing services, which China restricts. It set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor. It banned trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a practice still common in China that may have played a role in the pandemic. It required signatories to permit their workers to form independent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child labor practices.Indeed, speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \"this TPP sets the gold standard in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to open free, transparent, fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" It would build in \"strong protections for workers and the environment. ... Respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\"Typical of a Democrat, though, candidate Clinton ran away from the deal when she ran against Trump, rather than explain that some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 would-be TPP partners were already coming into the U.S. duty-free, while our goods and services were still being hit with some 18,000 tariffs in their countries -- tariffs that the deal would have eliminated. By accounting for 40 percent of global G.D.P., the original TPP would have become a real standards-setter in the Pacific.The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that U.S. national income would also have grown by some $130 billion a year by 2030 with the TPP. Not huge, but a nice bump.This is all the more a tragic comedy because our Pacific allies actually gave America <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> concessions to create the agreement that they would not do before -- precisely because they wanted us in the neighborhood as a bigger economic counterweight to China's growing domination. And then we walked away, and now China wants to take our place -- on its terms.It is not too late for America to get back into the TPP and even strengthen it by insisting on stricter rules of origin (which Trump added to the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). This would ensure that if somehow China were admitted to the partnership, it could not get around U.S. tariffs on certain Chinese exports by moving their final assembly to Vietnam, while keeping the core value chain in China.I'll take America joining the TPP today over helping to deploy submarines years from now. By then, if America continues to stay out, the CPTPP surely will be renamed again. It will have the same initials but they will stand for the \"Chinese People's Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"Now wouldn't that be funny. ...The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

In its new bid to join, China will likely try to use the lure of its huge market to entice the other members to live with China meeting some TPP requirements while muddying others.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes this Chinese maneuver more ridiculous is that Trump was so ignorant about the contents of the TPP before he tore it up -- his main objection was surely that Obama had negotiated it -- that when he was first asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015, Trump incorrectly suggested that China was in it from the start. Trump was just ahead of his time!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Trump's foolishness had a lot of tacit support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their knee-jerk opposition to the pact -- even though it was designed by Obama to address all the core labor and environmental issues that the left did not like about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's go to the videotape and recall what the Obama team -- not Trump, not the G.O.P. -- O-B-A-M-A -- built into the original TPP, which also included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the largest multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets. It detailed intellectual property protections for the newest and most advanced American-made tech products -- like free access for all cloud computing services, which China restricts. It set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor. It banned trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a practice still common in China that may have played a role in the pandemic. It required signatories to permit their workers to form independent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child labor practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \"this TPP sets the gold standard in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to open free, transparent, fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" It would build in \"strong protections for workers and the environment. ... Respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Typical of a Democrat, though, candidate Clinton ran away from the deal when she ran against Trump, rather than explain that some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 would-be TPP partners were already coming into the U.S. duty-free, while our goods and services were still being hit with some 18,000 tariffs in their countries -- tariffs that the deal would have eliminated. By accounting for 40 percent of global G.D.P., the original TPP would have become a real standards-setter in the Pacific.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that U.S. national income would also have grown by some $130 billion a year by 2030 with the TPP. Not huge, but a nice bump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all the more a tragic comedy because our Pacific allies actually gave America <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> concessions to create the agreement that they would not do before -- precisely because they wanted us in the neighborhood as a bigger economic counterweight to China's growing domination. And then we walked away, and now China wants to take our place -- on its terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not too late for America to get back into the TPP and even strengthen it by insisting on stricter rules of origin (which Trump added to the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). This would ensure that if somehow China were admitted to the partnership, it could not get around U.S. tariffs on certain Chinese exports by moving their final assembly to Vietnam, while keeping the core value chain in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'll take America joining the TPP today over helping to deploy submarines years from now. By then, if America continues to stay out, the CPTPP surely will be renamed again. It will have the same initials but they will stand for the \"Chinese People's Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now wouldn't that be funny. ...</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

Mexico's efforts merit optimism.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GOP presidential hopeful Patrick J. Buchanan and wannabe presidential kingmaker H. Ross Perot are throwing a national \"I-told-you-so\" party, reminding America that they warned us what would happen if the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement became law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S.-Canada-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, they say, has proved a disaster, resulting in the collapse of the Mexican peso, record U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, the loss of American jobs, falling U.S. wages, increased immigration from Mexico, even the spread of drug trafficking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the truth is that Mexico's problems have nothing to do with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. If anything, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> framework, having forced Mexico to keep its economic liberalization program on track, helped prevent an even worse crisis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's financial crisis was precipitated by the 40% devaluation of the peso last December. This was unrelated to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, which went into effect 12 months earlier. The peso's collapse was caused by mismanagement of Mexico's monetary and exchange policies by the government of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everyone realized when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was approved that Mexico's economy was not yet free. Despite the extensive economic reforms carried out by the Salinas government since 1988, Mexico's railroads, ports, electricity generation and petroleum and petrochemical industries remained under government ownership. Rigid labor laws discouraged investment and job growth. The economy was a regulatory jungle. Had Salinas pushed reforms more vigorously during his six-year term, private investors would have had more confidence in the stability of the country and might not have fled the Mexican market when the necessary belt-tightening began.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite Mexico's economic woes, President Ernesto Zedillo has pushed free-market reforms in recent months. Foreign investors now can own 100% of any financial institution. The government has put up Pemex's petrochemical plants for auction and is pushing plans to privatize the railroads and power utilities. A proposed law regulating the natural gas industry is expected to allow private investment in extraction and distribution. Zedillo also has announced a reform package designed to reduce burdensome regulation and to increase domestic savings and investment. Much more still needs to be done, but Mexico is moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It might not be moving at all without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. One of Mexico's foremost political analysts, Luis Rubio, director of the Center for Development Research Studies in Mexico City, says <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"is one of the few strong anchors that Mexico still has. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is keeping Mexico from losing all sense of direction.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Mexican economy starts growing again, as it inevitably will, the current U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit--caused by the peso's devaluation, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>--will turn into a surplus. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s potential was clearly demonstrated in 1994, when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Mexico jumped more than 22% to nearly $100 billion. During the five years before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect, bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had grown an average of only 12.5% annually.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The claim that more than 1 million U.S. jobs have been lost is way out of line. Economists use the widely accepted formula that every $1 billion in exports produces 20,000 jobs. If this formula is applied to the $8.5-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit reported by the U.S. Commerce Department for the first six months of 1995, 170,000 Americans may have lost their jobs this year as a result of the Mexican crisis. While that's nothing to be happy about, we should remember that 350,000 American workers file new unemployment claims every week. When the Mexican economy recovers, exports to Mexico will increase again, creating U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the argument that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has caused Mexican immigrants to flood across the U.S. border is preposterous. Mexicans have been migrating to the United States for many generations, and as Mexico's population increases over the next 15 years, from 91 million today to about 130 million, the number of Mexicans who enter the United States--both legally and illegally--will grow as well. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> creates greater economic opportunity in Mexico, those numbers will drop, not rise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-bashers are wrong on all counts. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the most important instrument America possesses for helping the achievement of an economically prosperous, politically stable Mexico. To do away with it now would be a terrible mistake.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: John Sweeney is a Latin American affairs analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based public policy research institute</p>\n"}
{"id": "398336933.xml", "text": "<h2>A better U.S. target in Japan--the consumer</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the summit behind him, Kiichi Miyazawa has given Bill Clinton his best going-away present. He's told the president that Japan cannot accept Mickey Kantor's insistence on targets, but he has agreed to the growth of U.S. exports in Japan's market. Not a bad deal for the president, since export targets not only tend to become export ceilings, but would also have strengthened Japan's bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president can now move on to a new agenda, but he and his people are going to have to adopt a two-part strategy. First, they need to put away the bludgeon; all that does is confirm the deep fear of the Japanese that they are being victimized. Second, the U.S. will have to show that when we talk about a \"partnership\" we mean it. But that's going to require that the president's people do their homework on the real state of play in U.S.-Japanese <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Listening to the common wisdom that most of our top exports to Japan are raw materials -- such as maize, raw wood and fish -- won't do it. The reality is the opposite -- and has been for years. Easily 60% of our exports to Japan are manufactured goods, and most of them are of the hightech variety. The adjacent table shows the value of our top five exports through 1991, and in 1992 the top four categories were: $3.9 billion for transportation; $3.6 billion for office and automatic data processing equipment and parts; $2.6 billion for electrical machinery, and $2.4 billion for cork and wood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither will listening to those who insist on talking down the dollar. That policy has been tried since 1985. The result is that while the volume of Japan's oil imports rose by 26% compared with 1985, its bill last year for oil and related products was just 39% of its 1985 cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason: Oil is denominated in dollars. That means we've given Japan a huge discount on its commodity imports, and at the same time nearly doubled the cost to U.S. firms of doing business in Japan. And the high cost of setting up in Japan, rather than tariffs or closed markets, was listed by Americans there as the chief deterrent to greater U.S. investment and exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president has got it right in targeting the Japanese consumer. For the best part of a year, Japan's press has been carrying stories about the rigged bids in the construction business, Liberal Democratic Party ties to gangsters, and what brought it all out -- the gold bars in Shin Kanemaru's house. All this confirmed what ordinary folks had long suspected: They are being ripped off; the prices they pay are crazily high, compared with just about anywhere else. More and more Japanese see this firsthand, since 10 million to 15 million of them travel overseas each year, a third to the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had a good illustration when one of my wife's Japanese friends came to visit. The first place she wanted to see was the local Safeway: to confirm that a 20-pound bag of rice sells here for about $6 to $7, and not the $45 to $50 it brings in Japan. Sure, Japan's bubble has burst, but the U.S. has held its share of the Japanese market. Over the past two years, Japan's imports from the European Community dropped 10%, but from the U.S. hardly at all: Imports in 1990 were $52.4 billion; in 1992, $52.2 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, while the Japanese don't particularly welcome the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they understand the pressures behind it. But how can the U.S. seriously consider extending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Chile, and now to Argentina, when there are more attractive prospects in Asia? Singapore alone -- with just 2.8 million people -- buys more from the U.S. than those two, and South Korea and Taiwan add an additional $15 billion each.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every time the U.S. mentions Chile and Argentina as the next candidates for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- or worse yet inludes Singapore -- Japan begins to think about its trading partners in Asia. Unless Washington wants to promote a world of regional blocs, it needs to consider Korea, Taiwan and, yes, Japan in that format. Now that's a real eye-popper, designed to respond to Japan's new-found emphasis on reform and Bill Clinton's talk of a new agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gordon is a fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii and professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398349699.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Nafta: Part of the trade-environment solution</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the window of a light aircraft a mile above the Yucatan peninsula, what may be the first environmental effects of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement appear on the landscape below. Orange groves, planted in anticipation of expanding U.S. citrus markets, threaten native forests and the diversity of species that depend upon them. Nevertheless, despite free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s potentially far-reaching environmental impacts, opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may not be an effective way to deal with them. It may, in fact, be counterproductive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a political issue has been highly absorbing for the environmental community. Although assessments of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact very widely, environmentalists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is not something they can afford to ignore. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-driven flows of capital and patterns of resource consumption affect virtually every facet of the environment. As a result, many of the conservation gains of the past two decades could be lost to even small shifts in international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's timber industry provides a good case study. In the country's southeastern region, a number of small-scale, community-run operations manage broad tracts of native forest under a conservation model. While these operations protect a wealth of species and ecological functions, they operate in the economic margin and are endangered by shifting terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As tariffs decline, these operations are at economic risk from timber industries in the U.S. and Canada. To minimize market losses, forest producers in Mexico face increasing pressure to cut more trees and concentrate operations in scarce old-growth forests where they can obtain the highest-value timber. The environmental cost of competing with the U.S. timber industry is simply too great. And, as is occurring now in the Yucatan, pressure to convert land to citrus and beef for American markets may accelerate forest loss.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The forest-into-citrus scenario is instructive for several reasons. First, it shows that the environmental impacts of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> may be felt far beyond the highly-polluted border area which has so preoccupied U.S. environmental groups. Second, it demonstrates that enforcement of U.S.-style laws in Mexico is not a magic solution; <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment effects are too diffuse, often lying beyond the reach of existing legal regimes. Finally, it lends some needed perspective to the claim that U.S. industry standards for environmental protection are always superior to Mexican standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the contrary, Mexican small-scale forestry operations are ecologically preferable to single-species tree plantations in the U.S. that support comparatively little wildlife. This last point deserves mention in the U.S. environment-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate, which has too often digressed into a nationalist -- sometimes protectionist -- dialogue, with inadequate appreciation of the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by Mexico. The real situation is likely to be much less one-sided, with impacts, good and bad, on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, if forest loss in Mexico is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> outcome, why should an environmental group support <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? The answer lies in the fact that the changes that many fear will ensue as a result of the treaty are happening already, even without a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. Mexican timber producers are under pressure now from increasing imports of cheaper American wood, as a result of tariff reductions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. Furthermore, land has been cleared along its Gulf coast since the 1980s for citrus exports under a more liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> regime in that sector. Much the same can be said about the maquiladora factories that line the heavily-polluted border region; they, too, have flourished without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we are serious about addressing these and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment impacts we must work to reform the economic forces behind them, and we must do so at the international level. But while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements are a logical point to confront our economic and environmental contradictions, they are not, strictly speaking, the cause of them. This should lead environmentalists to ask: If blocking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will not stem the environmental impacts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, can it provide the basis for beginning to resolve them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps it can. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents often assert that an increase in financial resources flowing to Mexico will raise its environmental protection standard. Indeed it is widely recognized that poverty leads to degradation of the natural environment. While increasing financial resources alone does not guarantee a cleaner environment, it at least provides an opportunity to pursue one-given sufficient political will.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, in Mexico the political will is strong. The environmental record of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been justifiably commended for its effort to harmonize environmental standards, and to enforce them more evenly. No administration in recent history has taken, at the highest levels, bolder steps for the conservation of Mexico's rich biological diversity. The receptiveness of the Mexican government to environmental concerns is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose, if we truly care about the future of environments outside our own borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How good is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the environment? It has been called \"the greenest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement ever.\" While this may be true, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is silent on many key environmental issues, such as the environmental effects of commodity price shifts on land use and the like. These are questions that need to be addressed by all parties -- Canadians, Mexicans and U.S. officials -- in an open forum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key component of negotiations on a much-needed environmental side agreement for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the creation of a special commission on the North American environment. An important role of the commission would be to monitor the effects of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in order to find cooperative solutions to environmental issues across the continent. That is not everything, but it is something essential for the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is accompanied by a strong environmental side agreement, it can provide the basis for long-term environmental improvements throughout North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Fuller is president of World Wildlife Fund.</p>\n"}

Now, however, in a stunning turnaround, many Cuban-Americans in the key states of Florida and New Jersey may be looking to a Democrat as the best hope of dislodging Fidel Castro.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the dismay of many liberal Democrats, Bill Clinton endorsed the Cuban Democracy Act -- almost six weeks before President Bush threw his support behind the bill. Introduced by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Robert Torricelli and passed last week at the close of the 102nd session by both the House and Senate, the bill tightens the U.S. embargo against Cuba.

My own impression of Cuba, after speaking with Cuban political leaders during a trip to Havana with business executives in June, is that change is in the air and time is short. Castro has booted his third in command (after his brother, Raul), imprisoned his own son and turned viciously on all political reformers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Short of violent change, Castro has just one option to salvage what he perceives as the chief accomplishments of the revolution: Step down while the education and health programs he established have a chance to survive him. Clearly, in light of his recent hard-line decisions, the chances of a voluntary retirement are slim. This is why the Torricelli bill makes sense for the Democrats and for Mr. Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a politically shrewd move, Mr. Clinton stood to Mr. Bush's right on the issue of Cuba, an issue the exile community is likely to vote above all others. Proof of the inroad that Mr. Clinton is making in this once Republican \"fortaleza\" is tangible: The week Mr. Clinton declared his support for the anti-Castro bill, he raised $125,000 in one night in a Miami fund-raiser on Calle Ocho, spoke to cheering crowds in little Havana's Versailles and Victor's restaurants, and returned with an additional $150,000 from an event in Coral Gables. Since then, even Tipper Gore has been greeted enthusiastically by rallies of Cuban-American Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By last month, polls still showed Mr. Bush leading Mr. Clinton in the Cuban-American community in Dade County by 72% to 23%. However, thinking among Dade County Republican Party officials is that if the president does not win the exile community by 80% to 85%, he will lose Florida. Recent elections bear this out: Sen. Connie Mack (whose amendment to the Cuban Democracy Act -- which prevents foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from trading with Cuba -- bears his name) won election by only 30,000 votes in an electorate of three million voters, a cutting edge shaped by the block of votes he received from 95% of Cuban-American exile voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Republicans should not take the Cuban-American vote for granted,\" says Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the powerful, Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. His personal campaign contributions to both parties during the past decade make him the largest Hispanic contributor in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton has met with exile leaders (the same leaders that Michael Dukakis refused to meet) twice, and now enjoys repeated audiences and tacit approval of leaders like Mr. Mas and open support of smaller exile groups, such as the Cuban-American Women for Clinton. Jeb Bush's strong ties in the Miami community are now mirrored by Hillary Clinton's personal relationship to the exile community -- her sister-in-law, Maria Victoria Arias, is a Cuban-American Republican living in Miami and mobilizing the community for Mr. Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the big political impact of the Cuban exile community extends beyond regional lines. Florida not only represents 7% of the nation's Hispanic voters, but the Florida Cuban community delivers 15% of all Hispanic campaign contributions nationwide. The Cuban-American community shapes Spanish television stations Univision and Telemundo, controls numerous radio stations, and, as of November, is assured of its third congressional representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now the Cuban exile community's political clout has even ventured into international affairs, apparently directly affecting provisions of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). Their interest was not in how increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> would affect the Cuban community, but a perception that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could have been an aid to Castro. Their fear: Mexico could purchase Cuban sugar and citrus for domestic consumption and then, under the agreement, sell its own sugar and citrus to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Accustomed to swinging into gear faster than a speeding lobbyist, Mr. Mas and other members of the Cuban community prepared an anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> campaign, including full-page anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> advertisements to run simultaneously in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. Two months before the Oct. 7 signing of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in San Antonio, Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called an emergency meeting with exile leaders, including Mr. Mas and an ambassador in Ronald Reagan's administration, Jose Sorzano. As a result of the meeting, the ads were pulled and a reliable Cuban source cites a five-point agreement by the Mexican government: 1) to deny Cuba concessional credits; 2) not to renegotiate its debt; 3) not to allow Cuba into the oil-trading San Jose pact; 4) to maintain its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Cuba at current levels and at international prices; and, 5) to provide no guarantees to Mexican private creditors who invest in Cuba.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in this country, many Cuban exiles are talking about voting for their first Democrat since JFK. Mr. Mas predicts that Mr. Bush could get as little as 60% of the Cuban vote, adding: \"Although I'm voting for Bush out of loyalty, Clinton's decisive support of the Cuban Democracy Act turned the Cuban-American community around.\" While it's too early to count Cuban votes in either New Jersey or Florida for either candidate, the Cuban exile vote, in two elections too close to call, may well turn the tide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Falk is a New York-based Cuban scholar and author of \"Cuban Foreign Policy\" (MacMillan).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Mexico Didn't Link <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> With Cuba\" -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1992)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>921016-0134</p>\n"}
{"id": "398377445.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Will Pemex follow YPF to the auction block?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MEXICO CITY -- President Carlos Saul Menem seeks to burnish his and his Peronist Party's image by privatizing Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's state oil firm. Before the July 2 partial sell-off, YPF President Jose Estensorro had slashed the number of workers to 10,600 from 51,000, opened attractive fields to private operators, and staunched the seemingly interminable flow of red ink to post a $259 million profit in 1992. Investors rushed in to buy 160 million shares of the slimmer, market-oriented Argentine company, generating $3.04 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also has experience restructuring state assets in preparation for their privatization. The Mexican chief executive has returned the banking system to private hands and sold off hundreds of other state firms. In most of these cases the need to increase efficiency before the assets were privatized was emphasized. This has led some to speculate that the current economic restructuring of the oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), may be a preliminary step toward privatization. However, Pemex which generates 30.2% of the country's foreign exchange and 24% of the federal budget, has proved a tough nut to crack.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's acutely nationalistic Constitution mandates state ownership and exploitation of hydrocarbons. To privatize Pemex, President Salinas would have to amend this fundamental law. Such an initiative would spark a firestorm of protest from nationalists, who are already outraged by the Mexico-bashing engaged in by Ross Perot, Rep. David Bonior, Lane Kirkland, and other foes of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas therefore insists that \"ownership and control of oil remain unalterably in Mexican hands.\" Needless to say, he realizes that with or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico cannot vault into the developed world as long as Pemex remains a synonym for inefficiency, waste, featherbedding, and pollution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After an April 1992 gasoline blast killed more than 200 people in Guadalajara, the 45-year-old chief executive accelerated the restructuring of the monopoly. The revamping, presided over by Pemex Director-General Francisco Rojas and Operations Director Adrian Lajous, resulted in the creation of four subsidiaries: Pemex-Exploration and Production (E&P), Pemex-Refining; Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals; and Pemex-Petrochemicals. Each unit is expected to become a profit center. As such it must take charge of its own budget, planning, personnel, and other functions. Near arms-length contracts and market-based (but still managed) transfer prices govern intersubsidiary transactions. \"For the first time,\" a Pemex official confided, \"we will learn just how much it costs to refine a barrel of oil at any of our half-dozen refineries.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eventually, representatives of Mexico's private auto, glass, transport, and chemical industries should be added to the subsidiaries' governing boards to provide a business perspective on Pemex operations. The current all-public sector composition of these boards prompted one puckish observer to exclaim: \"Pemex's new organization suffers from greater incest than the Inca royal family!\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the jury is still out on the \"New Pemex,\" several improvements are impressive, especially those accomplished by Pemex-E&P. Industry-watchers anticipated that this subsidiary -- which absorbs 58% of Pemex's $3 billion investment budget -- would resist change because of its size, nationalistic sensibilities, tradition of stressing volume produced over profits, and hostility toward the economists, accountants, and other technocrats who are so ubiquitous in the executive suite. But Manuel J. Ortiz de Maria, the 62-year-old petroleum engineer who directs E&P activities, has plunged into the whirlpool of reform without losing his bearings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even before the Guadalajara disaster, Pemex-E&P decentralized its operations by shifting desk-bound engineers and geologists into the field. And soon, E&P's central office will move out of Mexico City to Tabasco state, away from political pressures and closer to the action. Mr. Ortiz de Maria also has carefully studied the managerial techniques of domestic and foreign firms that hold service contracts to drill up to 24 wells in Campeche Bay. Attentiveness to the contractors' work has enabled Pemex to pare its drilling costs by one-third. This has helped enable the E&P division to register a 50-million-barrel increase in reserves. After eight years of decline, Pemex reported holdings of 65 billion barrels on January 1, 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pemex's marketing boss, an astute 41-year-old, cigar-puffing economist named Pedro Haas, now performs a cost-benefit analysis on every transaction in which it is involved. By stressing profitability, this initiative has saved Pemex money in 1990 ($50 million), 1991 ($70 million), and 1992 ($100 million).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And of course, Messrs. Salinas and Rojas broke the back of the mafia-like Oil Workers' Union with the January 1989 military action that ousted its egregiously corrupt leader. Since the putsch, Pemex has slashed its labor force to 116,000 workers from 210,000 -- with more pink slips expected this year. A new collective contract permits the state corporation to seek the lowest bidder for maintenance, transport, slop oil disposal and other work formerly guaranteed to venal, graft-ridden labor chiefs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new emphasis on efficiency has led to some dramatic new business arrangements which would have been inconceivable three or four years ago. Early this year, Pemex began a $1 billion joint venture with Shell Oil. In return for providing 100,000 barrels per day (b/d) of heavy Maya crude to Shell's upgraded Deer Park, Texas refinery, Mexico will receive 45,000 b/d of unleaded gasoline by 1995.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More market-driven advances may occur. On Aug. 4 the business daily El Financiero published a leaked report of President Salinas's plans to permit private companies to construct and operate natural gas and refined product pipelines. The documents, dismissed as \"apocryphal\" by Pemex, proposed converting the monopoly's exclusive pipeline network into a common carrier for third parties. It also recommended liberalizing imports of gasoline and industrial fuels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such hopeful developments aside, the nationalistic shackles from which President Menem has broken free still impede the introduction of sweeping rather than incremental reforms at Petroleos Mexicanos. While Pemex is more efficient than it was before Salinas's inauguration nearly five years ago, the granddaddy of all restructurings -- an Argentine-style privatization -- remains unlikely at least during this presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grayson teaches government at the College of William & Mary.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398488508.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: A Jamaican's case for trade parity with Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S.-Caribbean commercial links have generated American jobs at a rate of nearly 17,000 a year since the mid-1980s. U.S. overall exports to the Caribbean have expanded by more than 100%, and Caribbean exports to the U.S. have climbed by roughly 50%. By the end of 1994, combined U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> stood at $24 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 24 nations of the Caribbean Basin -- among them Jamaica, Trinidad, the Dominican Republic and all Central American countries -- have enjoyed these strong economic and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations during the past dozen years largely through the mechanism of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). But recent changes in U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law have put the long-term viability of this relationship in jeopardy. Under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, for example, Mexican exports now enjoy access to the U.S. market exceeding that accorded to Caribbean exports. The General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> implementing act has exacerbated these effects by phasing out a program that regulated the importation of textile and apparel products from all countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, Caribbean countries are now forced to compete in their largest market at a substantial competitive disadvantage. In the two years that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect, there has been a steady diversion of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment away from the Caribbean Basin nations. In the textile and apparel sector alone, Mexico has displaced other Caribbean countries. It is now the single largest source of U.S. garment imports from this hemisphere. Such diversion has begun to erode U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations, weakening the employment base of hundreds of thousands of Americans who depend upon strong U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit with Central American leaders last month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that President Clinton will include in his fiscal year 1997 budget request a key proposal to strengthen U.S.-Caribbean Basin economic relations. Coming on the heels of Cuba shooting down two unarmed civilian planes, Mr. Christopher's announcement underscores the compelling U.S. national and security interests in maintaining strong economic links with the Caribbean region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary Christopher's announcement advances a bipartisan proposal currently before the Congress that will correct the unintended adverse effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the Caribbean Basin. The prospect of enhanced U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links enjoys widespread support, and has been endorsed by many Caribbean heads of government and countless business and community leaders, both in the U.S. and in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As currently envisioned, the proposal will insure that Caribbean and Mexican exports enjoy equal access to the U.S. market during the next 10 years. During this transitional period of \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity,\" Caribbean countries will be required to take reciprocal steps to expand market access for U.S. products, strengthen investment guarantees, expand worker's rights, and improve intellectual property protection. By the end of the 10-year period, the U.S. will have strengthened its commercial relationship with the Caribbean region while the CBI countries will be in a better position to join a hemispheric-wide Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity would be felt strongly over the next few years in both the Caribbean and in the U.S. Presently, the U.S.-Caribbean commercial relationship supports more than 260,000 jobs in the U.S. and countless more throughout the Caribbean. The Caribbean Basin is now the 10th-largest export market for the U.S. and one of the few regions in the world where U.S. exporters maintain <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will build on this framework as elevated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> levels generate thousands of new jobs each year in the U.S. and the Caribbean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits to U.S. industry for this program are clear as well. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will enhance international competitiveness of the U.S. textile and apparel industry by building on the productive relationship already enjoyed by U.S. and Caribbean firms. Since Caribbean garment exports rely upon U.S. components and labor for as much as 70% of their value-added, any expansion of the Caribbean garment industry directly benefits U.S. firms and workers. Many Caribbean governments already operate programs that successfully fight illegal textile transhipment from East and South Asian countries, so <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will strengthen a framework that protects the domestic industry from quota violations. Finally, as Caribbean governments take steps to strengthen intellectual property and investment protections -- as Jamaica has already done -- many other U.S. industries will gain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This trading relationship means that overall economic growth and development in the Caribbean Basin can directly translate into expanded export opportunities for the U.S. Roughly 60 cents of each dollar the region earns from exports to the U.S. market is spent in the U.S. buying American-made consumer goods, food products, raw materials and capital equipment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity has emerged as a cost-effective economic and foreign policy instrument to promote regional development. Increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> activity will provide many additional commercial opportunities, which are so crucial for healthy economic growth in cities and rural areas throughout the U.S. Stronger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links will inevitably lead to better cooperation in other areas, such as narcotics interdiction, anticorruption activities, and efforts to fight terrorism and international crime. Moreover, as Caribbean economies prosper, they will become less dependent on U.S. foreign aid at a time when foreign assistance is getting close scrutiny. In many ways, therefore, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity represents a tangible \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not aid\" approach, which has taken on new importance in light of the U.S. budget debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Numerous studies have shown that strong regional economic links are crucial not only in creating economic opportunities throughout the U.S. and the Caribbean Basin but also in supporting stable and mutually beneficial security relationships.

{"id": "398783968.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Why Is Chile Still Waiting for Her American Suitor?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SANTIAGO -- Springtime is in full bloom here.

Soon there might even be a big wedding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's been almost eight years since the U.S. told Chile that it would tie the knot in a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty, along the lines of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). Through two U.S. presidential elections, the collapse of a World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization (WTO) summit in Seattle and renewed U.S. protectionism in steel and agriculture, Chile has held out hope that America would eventually make good on that promise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Zoellick says the deal might be signed by year-end. Chile's director for multilateral economic affairs, Ricardo Lagos Weber, in an interview here this week echoed those sentiments. \"We still have differences,\" he told me. But, \"Yes, I think we can make it for December.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Small, remote Chile badly wants this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. But what may be less well understood is that the U.S. should want it at least as much, if not more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile's relatively open economy is heavily dependent on export growth; greater access to the U.S. market would be a boon. Despite U.S. farm subsidies that make it difficult for Chilean farm exports to compete, Mr. Lagos sees \"substantial\" benefits for his country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the U.S. the reasons to complete the agreement go well beyond access to Chilean goods and markets. The U.S. desperately needs a win in Latin America. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> expansion is one of the few productive and morally defensible tools to advance U.S. interests in political and economic stabilization in a region that is rapidly falling apart.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without a U.S.-Chile free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, Chilean modernization and openness would probably survive. But the rest of the region, which is already listing left toward renewed nationalistic populism, could read the failure of the deal as a sign of U.S. arrogance and indifference. This might revive the careers of dangerous demagogues in places like Peru and Argentina and could encourage in Brazil even greater levels of economic insulation than already exist. More destabilizing poverty would likely follow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making good on its promise to let Chile into the U.S. free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club is a necessary first step in salvaging U.S. leadership in the region. As it stands now Latins are more likely to complain about U.S. hypocrisy -- be it on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or narcotics use -- than to defend American values, even though most instinctively prefer economic liberalism. Preaching open markets to poor countries while practicing protectionism in Washington has not only energized anti-American populists. It has hurt the advocates of economic freedom who are fighting the liberalization battle on the ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By any measure Chile has been badly treated by the U.S. Its strong rule of law, secure property-rights protection, impressive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> openness and stable democracy long ago qualified it as a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partner with the U.S. But after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was signed in 1994, the Clinton administration abandoned efforts to expand regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Fast-track negotiating authority -- which gives the administration the power to negotiate deals that Congress must then vote up or down -- expired in 1994. Democrats wanted any renewed fast-track to include labor and environmental provisions. Republican refused on grounds that this would shut out low-cost trading partners. The free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda died.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile may have been jilted but it did not stay home spilling tears over its fickle suitor. Instead it went ahead with its own free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda, while keeping open the possibility of a U.S. deal. This has turned out to be a brilliant strategy and one that would surely serve other nations in Latin America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undoubtedly the best thing Chile has done to advance its own prosperity is its unilateral tariff reductions. In 1998, while many of its neighbors decided to wait for the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas -- then at least seven years off, Chile rejected the reciprocity argument. That year it passed a law to reduce its uniform tariff by one point a year until it reaches 6% in 2003. Three agricultural products -- wheat, vegetable oil and sugar -- have higher levels of protection but the vast majority of Chilean imports fall under the uniform tariff structure. Chilean producers are now among the most innovative and competitive in the region. That's at least part of the reason why a visitor to Chile senses a quality of life infinitely superior to the rest of Latin America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile has also signed a number of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. In 1997 it made a deal with Canada, the results of which Mr. Lagos describes as \"fantastico.\" In 1998 it upgraded a narrow bilateral agreement with Mexico to a full-fledged <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. More recently it has negotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> openings with South Korea and a not-yet-ratified treaty that raises quotas with the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that President Bush has \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" -- an updated version of fast track -- there are real reasons for optimism. Chile has put labor and environmental issues on the table and both sides have pledged to respect their own local laws. We're not interested in being \"poor cousins,\" says Mr. Lagos. \"We will play by the same rules for dispute settlement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those rules are still being worked out but they will probably set an important precedent for the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda of the entire region. \"When you don't have one billion people, you don't have nuclear weapons, you don't speak English and you don't have money, the only thing you have are rules and you have to believe that the big chaps will play by the rules,\" says Mr. Lagos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can be hoped that those rules will not include the potential use of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions. Poor Chile will continue to have to deal with the runaway use of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in the U.S., which is bad enough.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In any case, the best strategy would be to treat the Chilean democracy with the respect it deserves. That means local labor disputes are up to Chileans. Chilean Socialist President Ricardo Lagos and his left-of-center coalition are now leading the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the backing of Chilean labor unions. If they want a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the U.S., America should applaud.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398802964.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Clinton's Sugar Daddy Games Now Threaten Nafta's Future</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her testimony to the grand jury Monica Lewinsky offered an interesting aside: In the middle of a \"meeting\" with her, Bill Clinton took a phone call from Florida sugar baron Alfonso Fanjul.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That little detail didn't make the tabloids but it raised eyebrows among free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advocates. The easy access to an otherwise engaged president reaffirmed the suspicion that sugar growers -- who keep Washington sweetened with their political giving -- had disproportionate influence in the Oval Office. In 1999 Mr. Fanjul raked up a million dollars for Mr. Clinton's party at a fundraiser on his estate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Fanjul call came to mind in early December when Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu accused the Bush administration of promoting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in sugar with Mexico. The claim helped her rally the highly-protected Louisiana sugar industry and allowed her to squeeze past her Republican opponent in a runoff Senate race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sugar issue was quickly relegated to footnote status by the press. Yet it has implications that go well beyond the artificially high price of sugar that American consumers have to eat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Landrieu and her sugar constituents want no less than a renegotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which has expanded U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to the tune of $350 billion annually and holds promise for future growth and prosperity. Whether the U.S. gives the sugar lobby what it wants is really about whether it will stick to its pledge to fully open the U.S. market and therefore maintain the moral authority to hold Mexico to its promise to do the same.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course Ms. Landrieu doesn't want less access to other imported goods for Louisiana. During the campaign she denounced the new Bush steel tariffs because access to high quality, low-priced steel is so vital to that state's economy. She merely wants special protection for the sugar lobby. But if that is granted why should any of the other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> components continue to hold?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, the Clinton administration's close relationship with sugar producers and Ms. Landrieu's eleventh hour election promise to defend them are related. To understand just how it's necessary to go back in time to the period between the signing of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1992 and its ratification by Congress in 1993. It was then that the U.S. sugar industry began kicking up a storm about the opening of its notoriously protected market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks began Mexico and the U.S. agreed that the whole economy had to be on the table. \"Otherwise, each side would begin picking and choosing what it wanted to protect and the agreement would be full of exceptions,\" says one former Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. That meant, of course, that the U.S. sugar market had to be opened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> says that in 2008 all sugar tariffs and duties will disappear. The agreement signed in 1992 said that from implementation until the full 2008 opening, duty-free quotas in sugar would grow annually and tariff rates for amounts over those quotas would come down gradually.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1992 Mexico was a net importer of sugar. But the 1992 agreement said that if Mexico was able to generate sugar surpluses over and above its domestic consumption for two years in a row, it would be allowed to export those surpluses duty-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That opened a preliminary to the main bout. Mexico now produces surplus sugar and wants to export it. But the U.S. says that between the time <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was signed and when it was ratified, it signed a \"side letter\" with Mexico, which put new limits on sugar exports to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That \"side letter\" says that Mexico can export surplus sugar to the U.S. only after it reduces what is considered a \"surplus\" by the amount of high-fructose corn syrup that it consumes. Since under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico imports and consumes large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup from the U.S., the amount of surplus sugar that qualifies for duty-free export under the U.S. side letter drops precipitously. The letter also caps duty-free Mexican sugar at 250,000 metric tons per year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increase in Mexican sugar production was predictable. To understand why, it's important to remember that U.S. price supports in sugar are maintained through the use of high tariffs. That meant that if Mexico was going to have open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the U.S. its tariffs had to be the same as U.S. tariffs. In other words, North America had to form a customs union with a common external tariff on sugar. This raised the price of sugar in Mexico, creating an incentive to produce more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Mexican industry gained <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> access to high-fructose corn syrup from the U.S. and began using it in many products instead of sugar. The net effect was that while there was more sugar produced in Mexico, consumption did not go up as much. That's how Mexico managed to become a net exporter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. sugar producers saw this coming and threatened to block <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ratification. To overcome their objections the Clinton administration's U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Mickey Kantor drafted the side letter. The U.S.T.R. says it stands by the letter. But Mexico's claim that it never signed anything so ridiculous sounds plausible. It looks more like Mr. Kantor was trying to pull a fast one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year the Mexican congress slapped a 20% import tariff on U.S. high-fructose corn syrup as retaliation for U.S. sugar protection. That's harming a whole line of U.S. producers of corn-based products, along with Mexican consumers. Sen. Charles Grassley, and seven other Corn Belt senators are raising cane about this with President Bush. But they should be going after their colleagues protecting sugar.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are rumors that the U.S. sugar industry is trying not only to force Mexico to accept the terms of the disputed letter but is also pressuring the U.S. to renege on the full opening in 2008. The U.S.T.R. may be trying to find a compromise, knowing that if sugar doesn't get what it wants it will seek anti-dumping relief that could mean sharply higher tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power of organized domestic producers to win protection is legendary. Yet modern statesmen recognize the need for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> leadership in the interest of reducing third-world poverty and increasing global stability. Ms. Landrieu's retrograde protectionism may have seemed sweet on election day but it is bad for world health.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398947189.xml", "text": "<h2>Trading Places</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Howard Dean recently told the Washington Post that former Democratic Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had advised him he couldn't \"sell\" Dr. Dean to Wall Street if he didn't become more of a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r. Dr. Dean declared this almost as a badge of honor, which illustrates a dangerous economic turn in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our differences with Bill Clinton, but there's no doubt one of his achievements was leading his party away from protectionism. Open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was a pillar of his New Democrat philosophy. He and Al Gore routed the AFL-CIO and Ross Perot to pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, followed by bills to create the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and allow most-favored nation trading status for China. A decade later all three have contributed to American prosperity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But without a Democrat looking out for the national interest from the Oval Office, the party is now slipping back toward <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> parochialism. On Capitol Hill, the party's regional and union interests have become dominant; most Democrats opposed giving President Bush new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiating authority last year. More ominous still is the rhetoric coming from the Presidential candidates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In demanding that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> be renegotiated, Dr. Dean is hardly alone. With the exception of Senator Joe Lieberman, we can't find any of the other candidates who still supports it. John Kerry attacked Dr. Dean as a protectionist the other day, but the Massachusetts Senator has also said he regrets having voted for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Dr. Dean is also getting whacked from the left for not being protectionist enough: Congressman Dick Gephardt has mocked the fact that Dr. Dean sent Bill Clinton a letter supporting it and showed up for the signing ceremony in 1993, only to walk away from it now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Senator John Edwards is sending out weekly news releases trying to pick a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fight with China. Even Mr. Lieberman, a recognized free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, is trying to show he can also be \"tough\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by joining the Bush Administration in knocking China around.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats insist they don't oppose free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but only that any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements must have \"labor and environmental standards\" written into them. Dr. Dean has told several interviewers that he would withdraw from the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if they weren't altered to ensure that foreign workers have \"the same labor laws and labor standards and environmental standards\" as the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this is a recipe for precisely the kind of U.S. unilateralism they claim to deplore in the Bush Administration. Not many other countries are pleased to import another country's labor laws. Poor countries with low wages especially resent the forced imposition of U.S. rules that assume a far higher standard of living.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Lieberman noted in this month's Albuquerque debate, \"That would mean we'd break our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with Mexico, with Latin America, and with most of the rest of the world. That would cost us millions of jobs. One out of every five jobs in America is tied up with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. So if that ever happened, I'd say that the Bush recession would be followed by the Dean Depression.\" Dr. Dean tried to backtrack that he'd accept \"international\" standards as well, but his protectionist bent is clear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be that some of this is due to the free-for-all that the Democratic race has become. The candidates are looking for any edge, and in particular they covet the early endorsement of the AFL-CIO that helped Al Gore beat Bill Bradley in 2000. Union members are a huge share of the nominating electorate, especially in Iowa, where Dr. Dean hopes to knock Mr. Gephardt out of the race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet promises made during a campaign are hard to break. Mr. Bush's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> record is less than sterling, with its steel tariffs and the recent collapse of global talks in Cancun. So <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> would be one issue where the Democratic nominee could campaign as the more pro- growth candidate who supports American global economic leadership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the Democrats are falling for the fool's gold of protectionist politics. The polls always look at first glance as if bashing foreigners on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is popular. But campaign history is littered with politicians who have tried it and been rejected. No major American political party has nominated an avowed protectionist since Herbert Hoover in 1928 -- and we know how that turned out.</p>\n"}

Several have been unspooling in my mind these days: \"All About Eve,\" \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"A Star Is Born,\" even \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" if one assumes the Clintons are going to either pull off this heist or go down in a blaze of bullets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary's star is being eclipsed. Why?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A year ago, Hillary Clinton assumed the effort would bring her the prize. Instead, it has brought her to the precipice. What happened? What was supposed to be triumph has turned to tragedy. Who rewrote the plot?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first revision came at the hand of Howard Dean. The Vermont governor's quixotic 2004 presidential run did one big thing: It let the netroots out. It empowered the Democratic Left. Web-based \"progressives\" proved they could raise lots of political money and bring pressure, especially when allied with labor unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They didn't defeat centrist Joe Lieberman in 2006, but they drove him out of the party. They pushed the party's Iraq policy under Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi into total, rejectionist opposition. In this world, the Petraeus surge is a failure, period. Thus, Obama calmly gives the surge little or no credit. Also in this world, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are anathema, as seen in the House refusal to pass the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Colombia, the U.S.'s strongest ally in South America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the netroots has done is bunch up the party ideologically. While the Republican Party slices conservative ideology as thinly as aged prosciutto, the Democrats, in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, are all swinging a populist anvil -- with the left hand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This pushed Hillary out of the Clinton comfort zone. She established her Senate career as a reasonable person, winning public compliments from GOP colleagues. Came the campaign and she finds herself onstage with wall-to-wall men of the ascendant populist left.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the Democratic Party is as far left as at any time in its history. Both Al Gore and John Kerry ran as economic populists, but there was nothing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> like what we have heard in this campaign. In Al Gore's 2000 nomination acceptance speech, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was the last issue mentioned: \"We must welcome and promote truly free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" His running mate was Joe Lieberman, also a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporter. Labor \"held its nose\" and voted for Gore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party next nominated another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporter, John Kerry, whose acceptance speech also reduced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to a line, with a quick bow to \"a fair playing field.\" There was talk that Kerry would cover himself by putting the ardently anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, pro-union Dick Gephardt on the ticket. Labor lost that one, too, but with the selection of John Edwards, the party became more invested in left-leaning populism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both Al Gore and John Kerry ran out of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tradition established by the Clintons and Democrats who straddled the center -- free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as a proven economic benefit but with pressure applied at the margins on labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barack Obama slipped smoothly into the anti-free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> current in his party. Hillary Clinton, one guesses, operates inside a structure of intellectual integrity of her own devising, and her anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> riffs (the \"time out\") sound strained.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's often said that she lacks Bill's political skills, whatever that means. Her retail skills are pretty darned good, though, good enough to defeat John Edwards or virtually any other Democrat one can imagine. So why is she losing to a three-year senator?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Partly because she's running in the wrong century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary's politics is the world of Eleanor Roosevelt, when it was all being born anew. The Washington of LBJ's Great Society in the mid- 1960s was alive with policy debates -- among Democrats. By now, the Democratic Party's ideas are largely generic. Everyone noticed that the Democratic presidential candidates were largely singing from the same script. Health care, public schools, green energy, the eternal shafting of the middle class, the unions, protecting Social Security and Medicare. This common script means that the Democratic primaries are largely an audition. The candidates are reading for a role. The lines are known.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The part, however, is challenging. The Democratic platform may be familiar, but it is also infused with the quality of a dream. Actually, the word \"dream\" gets used a lot in Democratic rhetoric. What are essentially bureaucratic arrangements, such as health insurance or after-school programs, are promised as \"universal.\" Meanwhile, \"the middle class\" is being offered a version of never- never land -- total public protection from the traps and betrayals of the private sector, which has been reduced to a kind of Grimm's Fairy Tale abstraction, the wolves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you are selling a dream you need the best possible salesman to make it seem somehow possible. They found him in Barack Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary attacked Obama this week on exactly this basis -- for selling dreams: \"And you know the celestial choirs will be singing . . . and the world will be perfect.\" In her world \"none of the problems we face will be easily solved.\" In her world, the real one, mediocre pols must be worked and massive bureaucracies pushed to do the right thing. And you know what? She just might be good at it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bitter irony is that what the Democrats want is someone like the original Clinton, another figure who can make the old-time religion sound not like a government program, but personally uplifting. She can't. In the Cleveland debate Tuesday, even Brian Williams couldn't resist noting \"a 16-minute discussion on health care.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're about six days away from the last close-up. What Hillary Clinton has invested, given and endured for her party to get to this moment is hard to imagine. Then the Democratic audience says: What difference does that make? A star has been born. Now comes the mad scene.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "398998596.xml", "text": "<h2>Cross Country: Union Man</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raleigh, N.C. -- Presidential hopeful John Edwards is fond of telling us that he's the son of a mill worker. And, although he now lives in a mansion and sports expensive haircuts, he also has another thing in common with some wage earners. He's betting his future employment on the power of organized labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is this a safe bet? In Tar Heel, N.C., where organized labor is trying to unionize the largest meat processing plant in the world, that is a pressing question.

The union also wants to dispense with elections and unionize the plant through a controversial process called \"card check\" -- which merely requires gathering signatures from a majority of workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where Mr. Edwards enters the fray. He supports the union in its fight against Smithfield and he supports legislation under consideration in Congress that would make it easier to use the card check instead of an election. Mr. Edwards also recently sent a letter to Smithfield CEO Larry Pope demanding that he \"protect the right of workers\" to bargain collectively. He wants Mr. Pope to support the card check.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This -- his support for dispensing with secret ballot elections in the name of workers' rights -- makes Mr. Edwards one of the most pro- union presidential candidates in a long time. And it is a departure from who he was when he was elected to the Senate in 1998 as a Southern centrist. That reputation led then-Vice President Al Gore to consider tapping him as a running mate in 2000, and it was one reason why John Kerry put him on the ticket in 2004.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past three years, Mr. Edwards has moved sharply to the left. Indeed, he has lashed himself to the mast of organized labor and steered hard to port. His bet is that service-worker unions will propel him to a surprise victory in the early Nevada presidential caucus, giving him a shot at beating the better-financed campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also feels that he has found an underserved constituency -- people displaced by the New Economy. And he is on to something. Outside of edge cities and burgeoning metro areas, the painful churning in the economy is easy to spot. Think boarded-up textile mills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, this isn't the image North Carolina has as a prototypical New South state. The banking capital of Charlotte and the knowledge- worker Mecca of the Research Triangle are more familiar symbols. But North Carolina used to have one of the nation's highest rates of employment and economic production in manufacturing, which offered good pay and stable employment for people with relatively little education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past decade, however, there was a big change. Manufacturing made up just 22% of North Carolina's gross state product in 2005, down from 30% in 1997. Nationally, manufacturing's share of economic output only fell half as much (from 18% to 14%) during that time. Notwithstanding solid growth in Charlotte and other areas, North Carolina has trailed the nation in most measures of economic performance since the mid-1990s. Many North Carolinians still work in small industrial cities and rural counties, but, for the most part, they've had to be retrained at great effort and haven't yet replaced their former incomes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recognizing public trepidation about these events, Mr. Edwards and the labor movement lay blame on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and the decline of unionization. But international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't start with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, nor did the downward trend in manufacturing. Many textile executives in this state even supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, hoping to join with lower-cost factories south of the border and thereby compete with Asia producers. The problem is that the Chinese -- and others -- are now making better quality products than they used to. American consumers are getting more for their money.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The union response has been to push for higher wages and to oppose moving or laying off workers. That has made it harder to keep manufacturing jobs. Consider the textile giant Pillowtex, which was once a fixture in Cabarrus County under the name Fieldcrest Cannon. In the late 1990s it was unionized by the Union of Needle<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>s, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). In 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy and sought partners to complete a turnaround and keep at least some of its domestic production. One was Springs Industries in South Carolina. But UNITE helped scuttle the Springs deal in April 2003, fearing the loss of its newly won foothold at Pillowtex. A few months later Pillowtex closed its Cabarrus County mill, leaving the union nothing left to stand on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that exercising political power through a union isn't a substitute for innovation, retraining and other steps necessary to make economies competitive. Look at the numbers. From 1997 to 2005 the 10 states with the highest rates of union membership -- which include California, New York and Michigan, among others -- had slower growth than the bottom 10 states. North Carolina is among just five states with union membership rates below 5%. But it also has a predilection for raising taxes -- the Tax Foundation estimated this year it that it has the 19th heaviest tax burden in the country, up from 36th in 2000. Further unionizing the workforce will likely only make the state look more like the old Northeast and Rustbelt than the New South.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Edwards urges private-sector unionization as the best way to protect middle class jobs, he can only hope that unions are better at fulfilling electoral promises than economic ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, is the author of \"Selling the Dream\" (Praeger Publishers, 2005).</p>\n"}
{"id": "409546270.xml", "text": "<h2>Bending on Steel</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The distance the current Democratic presidential contenders have strayed from the Clinton formula for winning the White House became startlingly clear last week with their reaction to President Bush's decision to remove the tariffs on imported steel that he had imposed 21 months before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats had a free shot at Bush for inconsistency, and most of them took it. But every e-mailed comment I saw from them said or implied that they would not have responded as Bush did when the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization ruled that the tariffs were unjustified and European nations threatened to slap $2.2 billion of retaliatory levies on U.S. products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party whose last president fought against protectionism and for international agreements to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has moved a long way in the other direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some of the candidates, this was a no-brainer. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri opposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the normalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China during the time Bill Clinton was president -- a stand that has earned him support from most of the major industrial unions this year. His comment that \"the president's action today demonstrates a callous disregard for the workers and the communities whose jobs and livelihoods have been decimated by unfair competition\" was entirely predictable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So was the similar blast from Rep. Dennis Kucinich. His home state of Ohio is a major steel producer, and many thought that Bush's original decision to impose stiff tariffs on foreign steel was a bid to strengthen his reelection hand precisely in such steelmaking states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But consider Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a consistent supporter of liberal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies throughout his career and a backer of the major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Rather than reiterate those beliefs, he said: \"We need a manufacturing plan with a spine of steel to promote American businesses and workers, not a manufactured plan that bends with every gust of wind.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who has been steadily tacking away from his earlier support of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as he tries to head off Gephardt in Iowa, went further than Lieberman. \"The president's decision to lift the steel tariffs early is just another example of this administration playing politics with people's lives,\" Dean said. \"When he imposed the tariffs, the president's rhetoric suggested that he actually cared about American steelworkers, their families and the communities in which they live. If that were the case, he would not be lifting them today.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within days after this bow to protectionism, Dean was endorsed by former vice president Al Gore, the same man who had defended <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in a notable debate with Ross Perot -- another sign of the seismic shift among Democrats on this issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the most interesting case is retired Gen. Wesley Clark. He is the favorite of many Clintonians, including Mickey Kantor, a key operative in Clinton's 1992 campaign and later his top <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. Just a few weeks ago, I attended a news conference where Kantor joined two others who had served as special <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative in Republican administrations, Carla Hills and Clayton Yeutter, in urging the Bush administration to take bolder steps to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. Kantor said specifically that while he thought at the time the steel tariffs were imposed that they were justified, it was imperative that they be lifted now -- as Bush subsequently did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Clark obviously did not consult Kantor, a senior adviser, on this question. In a most peculiar fashion, Clark first issued a statement that accused Bush of \"taking his cues\" from \"steel industry executives\" he had been with \"at a fundraiser in Pittsburgh.\" That made no sense, because the steel executives wanted the tariffs to remain in effect. So, 26 minutes later, came a correction from Clark's Little Rock headquarters, eliminating the bogus charge and complaining that Bush \"still has no strategy to help the 2.6 million manufacturing workers who have lost their jobs.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those job losses are real and have been underway for years. The Bush White House, with its politically driven and inconsistent actions, in effect has confessed that it has no answers to the problem. The Democrats are more than eager to exploit the situation and offer, with varying degrees of conviction and coherence, formulas they claim will help revive the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is being lost in the debate is the conviction that led Clinton -- and his Republican predecessors -- to place the United States on the side of reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and expanding international markets. This issue is a lot more serious than either party's approach to it would ever let you know.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>davidbroder@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "409555271.xml", "text": "<h2>The Doctor Factor</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At long last, the revelation I've been waiting for: the reason why -- beyond the prospect of epic, McGovernesque defeat -- I feel so uneasy about Howard Dean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The man is a doctor. This is the least-examined chapter of his career. But suddenly it all makes sense: Where else but in medicine do you find men and women who never admit a mistake? Who talk more than they listen, and feel entitled to withhold crucial information? Whose lack of tact in matters of life and death might disqualify them for any other field?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, I've spent almost two decades observing politicians, whom on balance I quite like, and more recent years observing doctors, who . . . . Well, let's just say that mine is a grudge tenderly nurtured over two and a half years of illness, encompassing roughly 32 doctors in six hospitals, plus scores of the medical students, fellows, interns and residents in whom we can see the doctor in larval form.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A doctor who has told you one thing at Appointment A might propose an entirely different course of action at Meeting B. Fair enough -- except for the pretense that nothing has changed. It is the very rare doctor who will say, \"I've changed my mind,\" or, \"Sorry, I was wrong when I said X at our last meeting.\" Usually, what he said last time has simply become . . . inoperative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now let's turn the clock back to September, and watch Dean answer George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" about his 180-degree turn, over the years, on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GS: \"On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, you used to be a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HD: \"George, you're doing it again. I supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and wrote a letter to President Clinton in 1992 supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's different than 'you used to be a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.' \"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GS: \"You were a strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HD: \"I supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Where do you get this 'I'm a strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'? I didn't do anything about it. I didn't vote on it. I didn't march down the street demanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. I simply wrote a letter supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dean was not in the least abashed that he had described himself on the same show, eight years earlier, as \"a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, we patients rarely dare to have such pugnacious dialogue with our doctors. George Stephanopoulos doesn't have to wear one of those demoralizing gowns with all the confusing snaps, and if you're sick you have more important things to do during your tiny portions of face time than bicker with your doctor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(A disclaimer: Naturally, all the doctors who are presently  treating and advising me are paragons of sagacity and compassion, nothing at all like the men and women I am so broadly lampooning. You know who you are.) The odd thing is that most of Dean's unacknowledged shifts in position are of the kind any other half- good politician, with some vaporous wording, could explain away in his sleep. But even when Dean makes what is clearly a blunder, it takes him days to make the apology that a rival campaign would instinctively produce before the next news cycle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings me to the irrationally strong impulse, shared by doctors and politicians, to hoard information. Consider the high- handed way Dean has tried to shield great portions of his gubernatorial records. Similarly, doctors seem bent on ensuring that you not read the runic scribblings they have made in your chart. During one hospital stay, as I sat in a wheelchair outside Radiology waiting to be pushed back to my room, I began idly flipping through my chart. A young female doctor-in-training I had never seen before stopped in front of me and said, \"You know, you really shouldn't be reading your chart.\" I thanked her for her advice and continued reading. She repeated her admonition. I explained that I was 43 and couldn't possibly read anything worse there than I had already been told by five real doctors. Upon which she actually wrested it from my grasp. (From this I learned always to go to a stall in the ladies' room when I want to read my chart.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, let's turn to what newspapers delicately title \"the temperament question.\" Dean's been called arrogant, angry, condescending, prickly. He has gotten this far by playing his chesty irritability as a sign of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I have enough brusque, irritable doctors in my life without sending one to the White House. My most memorable brushes have been with an eminent surgeon whose method is to stride into the examining room two hours late, pat your hand, pronounce your certain death if he can't perform an operation on you, and then snap at your husband to stop taking notes, he can't possibly follow the complexity of the doctor's thinking. Dr. X swats away questions like flies. He spends five precious minutes swearing at the wall-mounted phone, which decades of surgical experience have not equipped him to operate, and then finally pronounces that he can't perform the surgery. \"Unless you want me to. But there's a 50-50 chance I would kill you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why is it, I ask my husband on the way home, that I'm the one who's sick, but they're the ones who are allowed to have the big, operatic personalities?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have the same concern about Dean. Why should Democrats choose to stand around all spring and summer holding their breath against the moment when Dean says something arrogant or impolitic? (Think Southern guys with Confederate flag decals on their pickup trucks.) We're the ones who are supposed to be allowed to go on with our temperamental little lives, while our major-party nominees are the poor chumps who have agreed to adhere to the rigid, Ken-doll theater of politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so I bring to my assessment of this year's Democratic candidates one requirement that never crossed my mind before. First, do no harm.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409900949.xml", "text": "<h2>Globalization's Deficit</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FIFTEEN YEARS ago it was fashionable to pronounce the eclipse of the nation-state. In a globalized world, power would flow to supranational bodies: to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the European Commission, and even to a United Nations freed from the paralyzing divisions of the Cold War. Today this trend appears exhausted. Supranational institutions are not exactly retreating, but they have run out of forward momentum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with economic institutions. The latest round of tariff- cutting talks under the auspices of the WTO is stalling, not because countries oppose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but because they do not want to make concessions in this multilateral forum. Ambitions to deepen the WTO's power to settle disputes beyond <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> into labor and environmental issues have (fortunately) fizzled, while WTO rulings against protectionist European food regulation or American cotton subsidies don't (unfortunately) cause those policies to be reformed quickly. The same story holds for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In the 1990s there was talk of building <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tribunals on labor and the environment into influential voices. It hasn't happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Monetary Fund is even more diminished. In the 1980s and 1990s, it had a place at the top table, leading the charge for economic reform in developing countries during the years of the debt crisis, then struggling to manage financial crises from East Asia to Russia to Latin America from 1997 to 2001. But now the East Asians have built up financial reserves, partly to withstand future financial shocks without the IMF's assistance. Russia is high on petrodollars. And Brazil and Argentina recently paid off the IMF early in a gesture of independence. The world still faces big international financial issues, from the vast U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit to China's currency manipulation, but the IMF has chosen to duck them. Meanwhile, the World Bank is struggling to define its role in a world awash with private lenders. Its new leader, Paul D. Wolfowitz, wielded power confidently when he was part of the Bush administration, but he is feeling his way along in his new job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political institutions are in no better shape. Because of the rise of China and other big middle-income countries, the annual Group of Eight summits have lost their old claim to represent the world's key players; now that Russia has assumed the G-8 presidency, the forum's credibility has shrunk further still. Far from being reinvigorated by the end of the Cold War, the United Nations is in crisis: It is unable to respond decisively even to extreme moral affronts such as the Darfur genocide. It is tarnished by the oil- for-food scandal. And a laudable effort to modernize its institutions and doctrine petered out last year. The European Union has suffered the rejection of its new constitution at the hands of its voters, and NATO has been irrelevant in Iraq and has moved with imperfect unity and uncertain commitment into Afghanistan. The Bush administration makes no secret of the fact that its strategy in foreign policy is not to build international support through international institutions, but rather to forge coalitions of the willing on an ad hoc basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No doubt the pendulum will swing back again. Some day another global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> round may be completed; Argentina's leaders may trip over their own populism and return begging to the IMF. But for the moment the stalling of international institutions is striking  --  and troubling. Yes, democratic nation-states have more legitimacy and capability than international organizations; yes, they should remain the key units of international relations. But in a world knitted together by modern travel and communications, so many policy challenges cross national borders that institutionalized cooperation among nation-states must grow eventually. Financial crises, state failure, global warming, bird flu, terrorism: In the end there must be more than ad hoc answers to this constant succession of problems.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410159904.xml", "text": "<h2>At Best, a Pander; The Democratic candidates' intemperate promise to renegotiate NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NEVER illuminating, the Democratic presidential primary debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy took an especially dim turn last  week. In their final head-to-head meeting before Tuesday's Ohio and Texas primaries, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) declared that they would opt out of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico unless those two countries renegotiated the pact's labor and environmental provisions to the United States' liking. For two candidates who pledge to repair U.S. standing in the world, it was an odd swipe at our next-door neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mexican and Canadian officials recoiled at the prospect of overturning settled political and economic expectations in their countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could the Democrats mean? Labor and the environment are covered by \"side agreements\" to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, negotiated by President Bill Clinton, that call on all three countries to make and enforce good laws. The more recent U.S.-Peru <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Agreement went further, requiring Peru to change its labor laws to meet International Labor Organization standards. Both Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton, who supported the Peru deal, see it as a model for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation with Mexico, according to their advisers. But if that's all the candidates have in mind, they are wildly overpromising: The Peru pact's labor and environmental standards are only incrementally stronger than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreements. Meanwhile, the risks of renegotiation are huge. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is controversial in Mexico, too; farmers there are outraged by American agricultural imports. If the Mexican side asked that tariffs be reimposed on U.S. grain as part of a renegotiation, would President Obama or President Clinton sacrifice American farmers whose votes they were seeking only yesterday in Iowa? Or would he or she pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? If the latter, the tariffs on both sides would revert to the levels of 14 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whole U.S. industries have grown up to take advantage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

Two days before last  week's debate, Mr. Obama said, \"I don't think it's realistic for us to repeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" because that \"would actually result in more job loss . . . than job gains.\" Ms. Clinton awkwardly pleaded that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has benefited some parts of the country  --  such as Texas. Yet the urge to win Ohio trumped, and both Democrats made a threat that, if taken seriously, can be described only as reckless.  In other words, we have to hope that they were only pandering.</p>\n"}

Accord may ultimately bring real democracy to that nation.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nov. 2 was the Day of the Dead in Mexico, a celebration of life and its tragicomic interrelationship with death. There's a special bread that's baked for the occasion, pan de muertos, in the shape of a skull and bones, a special bright yellow flower laid on graves, cempasuchitl, and short, usually funny, poems written and recited, called calaveras.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nowhere among the multitude of graves spread across this big country was there even one this year marked \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" so I am told, though it can hardly be said that the Mexican populace is happy in the aftermath of the country's worst economic crisis since 1982. In fact, in a recent poll conducted in Mexico City, 79% of the respondents said Mexico is on the wrong economic track. While not specifically targeted in the questioning, no doubt, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement played a part in that rather overwhelming negative view.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't do too well on this side of the border either. In a Times poll conducted last year, people were split on the question of whether <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good or bad for the United States. Were I to have been asked at the time, I would have voted with those who opted for \"mixed,\" for the following reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the agreement has been in effect only three years. Its implementation is phased over 15 years. Second, other events have confounded the picture, in particular, the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994, the severe recession that followed and continuing issues with Mexico's transition to real democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to Mexico took a nose dive in 1995 as a result, but rebounded in 1996 and are on the same growth now as they were pre-devaluation. U.S. imports from Mexico currently are running about $10 billion ahead of exports, about the same <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gap that existed in 1995 and 1996. Textile/apparel imports, in particular, are surging at unprecedented rates of increase. Mexico is fast replacing Asia as America's tailor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Interestingly and perhaps ironically, the apparel industry in Orange County also grew substantially over the past five years. This parallel development is supported by immigrant labor (not necessarily all from Mexico) earning the U.S. minimum wage and exists despite the lure of lower labor costs in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to forget Ross Perot's powerful metaphor of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the \"giant sucking sound.\" Claims of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> range as high as 400,000 (Teamster's Union), whereas job gains from increased U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada are estimated at slightly more than 300,000 (President's Report). The truth is that both are probably overstatements and that the overall net U.S. employment effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been slightly positive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Orange County, employment levels in those industrial sectors mentioned with regard to export growth into Mexico have actually declined. For example, from 1992 to 1996, employment declined 18.9% in aircraft parts. In computing and office equipment, the decline was somewhat larger, at 23%. But average payrolls were growing faster, at 28.1% and 42.4%, respectively, signaling an overall net improvement in these sectors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even during 1993, when the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate was at its apex, the most astute observers were commenting that, rather than being a radical departure, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was most significantly a formalization and extension of tariff and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization policies toward the U.S. that had begun earlier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>High rates of export growth to Mexico have been the norm for Orange County businesses over the past few years too, with annual growth rates averaging 25%. From UCI's 1997 Orange County Executive Survey, 26.8% of Orange County businesses involved in international sales and/or operations were doing business in Mexico, with 8.6% more planning to enter the Mexican market soon. In 1996, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the county's second most important export destination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Probably the most accurate overall conclusion about the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to date is that it has helped Mexico and Canada without really hurting the U.S. In addition, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not just about economics, particularly where Mexico is concerned. Mexico has a long way to go politically. It is hoped that democracy and a more export-oriented economy will begin to supplant corruption as the glue that holds Mexico together. The end result should be the strengthening and expansion of the middle class. But that is likely to take a long time, and the transition will undoubtedly have some rough spots along the way.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, patience is indeed going to be a virtue where Mexico and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are concerned.

{"id": "421624116.xml", "text": "<h2>Commentary; Shine NAFTA's Light on the Darker Corners</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Robert A. Pastor, a professor of political science at Emory University, is writing \"Lessons from the Old World for the New: Constructing a North American Community\" for the Institute for International Economics</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many of his predecessors, President Bush wisely decided that his first meetings with foreign leaders should be with our two neighbors--Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who he met last week, and Mexican President Vicente Fox, who he meets on Friday. The meetings should lay the foundation for a North American community that corrects the mistakes and omissions of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which began six years ago, succeeded in what it was designed to do. It reduced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, and today the United States exports nearly four times more to our two neighbors than to Japan and China and 40% more than to the 15-nation European Union. U.S. firms have become continental and more competitive; our continent, more integrated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s failure has come from what it omitted. The peso crisis of 1995, which reduced Mexico's economy by 6% and left the United States disenchanted with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, occurred because we had no institutional capacity to anticipate problems or coordinate policy. Duplicating bureaucracies and weak infrastructure at both borders have raised the cost of doing business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All three leaders, who won elections in 2000, should begin by agreeing on principles to guide the relationship and the goals North America should pursue. Without such an understanding, the partnership implicit in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s spirit will continue to be sabotaged by the U.S. penchant for unilateralism and the Canadian and Mexican preference for bilateralism. The United States angers its neighbors when it acts on issues like drug trafficking without consulting them, and our neighbors miss an important opportunity when each of them deals with Washington without the other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three North American countries should learn from the Continent's experiment on integration. The European Union's mistake was to over-bureaucratize. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s was the opposite--it has no serious institutions. Chretien, Bush and Fox should each appoint five distinguished individuals outside of government to lead a North American Commission, or NAC. Unlike the European Commission--the EU's executive body--which is bureaucratic and executive, the NAC would be lean and advisory. Its mandate would be to define an agenda for the summit meetings of the three leaders and to provide a continental perspective, offering plans and options for North American infrastructure and transportation, uniform rules for customs and immigration and trilateral approaches to handle integration's dark side (drugs, illegal arms sales, etc.) without impeding the legitimate flow of people and goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the three leaders, Mexico's Fox has been the boldest in proposing a common market within 20 years. Bush and Chretien have been cautious, but there is evidence that the public's mind is open to such an idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three leaders should agree to raise the lagging regions of North America, particularly the poorest areas of Mexico. The EU provides loans that represent 2% to 4% of the gross domestic product of the four poorest countries to improve their infrastructure and education. In just 15 years, these funds, good economic policies and the single market significantly reduced the disparities between the rich and poor countries of the EU. It would be hard to find a better investment in North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is an auspicious moment for the three leaders to step beyond the nasty disputes on drugs, immigration or softwood lumber and agree to a set of goals for all North Americans. Such an initiative would not only be good for all North Americans, it would also illuminate a path for other regions to emulate.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429146035.xml", "text": "<h2>Demythologizing the Trade Pact</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has been overheated. Critics proclaim the pact -- which would eliminate most tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers with Mexico and Canada over the next 15 years -- a national catastrophe, threatening jobs, wages and the environment. Proponents claim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will boost employment and that its environmental provisions are a lovely shade of green.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is more mundane. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would have a modest economic impact in Mexico but a trivial impact on the U.S. economy. Mexico is too small to threaten U.S. firms, and U.S. tariffs are already so low that elimination couldn't possibly lead to a flood of Mexican imports. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> spells neither economic salvation nor ruin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will jobs disappear? Ross Perot warns that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will take jobs away from up to six million Americans -- based on the absurd calculation that the agreement threatens every worker in industries that use a lot of labor. The Administration says that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will boost employment. Neither is correct.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> pacts affect where people work, not how many people work. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, more Americans would find work in service industries (like insurance) and high-tech manufacturing (computers) for export to Mexico; fewer Americans would work in glass-blowing and apparel industries that would lose out to Mexican imports. But overall employment would not change. With or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. employment rate will again hover around 6 percent once the economy recovers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the workers displaced by Mexican imports won't be the ones who find the extra work in export industries. Fortunately, the number of displaced workers would be small. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, over 10 years, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would add fewer than 500,000 to the 20 million workers who'll be displaced for other reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will wages shrink? Mr. Perot warns that U.S. firms will flee to Mexico to hire low-paid workers; employers who stay will drive down wages to Mexican levels. Some employers will relocate, but Mr. Perot's numbers are cockamamie. Most studies predict foreign investment in Mexico, an economy only one-twentieth the size of the U.S., would rise by no more than about $15 billion a year -- a tiny fraction of the $500 billion investment in plant and equipment that takes place every year in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides, low wages primarily reflect low productivity, giving companies little reason to relocate -- otherwise Haiti would rule the corporate world. And because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is expected to increase U.S. exports, it is as likely to raise U.S. wages as lower them -- though in neither case by very much.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will the environment suffer? Critics charge that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will encourage U.S. firms to relocate to take advantage of Mexico's notoriously lax enforcement of environmental laws. The threat is real but small. Few firms face compliance costs larger than 1 percent of total costs, which is too small to warrant the journey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are legitimate questions about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s environmental impact: Does <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> adequately protect U.S. health and safety standards; will it protect the environment along the border? And critics have rightly pointed to the agreement's weak environmental dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms. But there's still time to make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> better when the Clinton Administration negotiates a supplemental accord on the environment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> raise troubling questions because they break with the honorable U.S. tradition of treating all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners alike. But Canada and Mexico are special cases because they are neighbors. And <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would help Mexico lock in recent market reforms that the U.S. supports. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't an economic magic bullet, but it does some good and no great harm.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429235383.xml", "text": "<h2>Health Care -- By-And-By</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The autumn leaves won't be blowing across Lafayette Square for a while yet, but Washington is already aflutter with contradictory advice for President Clinton on his legislative agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of it is malicious. The Republicans would like to scuttle health care. The Perotistas and a peevish lot of Democratic House members would like to humble Mr. Clinton on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of it is confused. Senior economic aides want a big push on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> while the top political advisers want Mr. Clinton to stick with his health care mandate and not get sidetracked on a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill inherited from President Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And on every side, one hears warnings of a rough new beast from Congress that lopes alongside the dread monster known as Gridlock. This new critter, called Overload, is said to batten on the unselective yearnings of an Oval Office novice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what's a President to do? Well, it wouldn't hurt to take another look at the worst-of-all-worlds agenda being pushed by his top advisers. Their plan calls for Mr. Clinton to put his prestige on the line to press for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as the main must-pass legislation for the fall. His big health care address in late September would be used not to introduce legislation but to initiate deliberations that would not produce a vote until mid-1994. Some essential parts of the Clinton campaign package, like reforms to reduce the role of special interests, do not have a prominent place on this agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do history and current political realities suggest that this is a sound approach? Not really.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The treaty is worth passing, but not at great cost. It could wind up looking like a Clinton version of President Carter's treaty on the Panama Canal. Mr. Carter spent huge political capital on the treaty. The problem was that no one really cared about the canal, except possibly Ronald Reagan, who used its surrender as a club against Mr. Carter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So who cares about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Certainly not organized labor or environmentalists or the Democrats who represent them. This is, after all, Bush legislation rooted in the tradition of Republican free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs. A canny decision would be to let Senator Bob Dole and his fellow Republicans do some heavy lifting and to saddle House Speaker Tom Foley with the responsibility for the troubled House. Mr. Foley, after all, is supposed to keep order among the Democrats, and right now his whip, David Bonior, is rounding them up to oppose their President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The next task is to get health care on a faster track. This issue, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, is where Mr. Clinton should risk defeat. We have just finished eight months of largely secret talks about how to reform health care. To promise another 12 months of deliberation invites public disenchantment. Yet the current plan is to use Mr. Clinton's health care speech to outline the principles of the program rather than its legislative design.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something is amiss here. Mr. Clinton has a passionate commitment to create a health care system that would stand as a monument of American social legislation. The American people want that to happen. So by what logic does it follow that he should be gambling his less than abundant supply of prestige on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rather than health care?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here is one answer: Some White House aides fear that Mr. Clinton does not have the votes to pass his program. They hope that a victory on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with Republican and Democratic votes, will make him look like a bipartisan muscle man.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it is really a strategy for the faint of heart. If Mr. Clinton sticks to it, that speech on health care better be a doozy. In it, he will have to explain why it was smart to throw out a do-nothing Republican for a by-and-by Democrat.</p>\n"}

He supported it not out of any measured political and economic assessment but for the same reason he had chosen Dan Quayle as his running mate: he wanted to reward and encourage a young man to whom he had taken a liking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The young man was Mr. Salinas. Trying to modernize and open the corrupt, protected and state-dominated Mexican economy (and deflect charges that his Presidential election had been stolen), Mr. Salinas wanted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as his centerpiece initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had not been pursued earlier by the U.S., Mexico and Canada for valid and substantive reasons. First, Mexico was far less advanced and economically open than the other two. If this were the 1960's, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be akin to an embryonic European Community of Germany, France and Spain; Spain would need years of economic, financial, political and social adjustment to truly fit with the others.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, as a regional bloc <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be at odds with the international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment system represented in GATT. Countries not in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be on the outside looking in, and will face discrimination against their products. Caribbean chiefs of state already have protested.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By suggesting that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should be expanded gradually southward into Latin America -- and implying that the U.S. should consider joining a new Pacific bloc -- Mr. Clinton, perhaps unknowingly, has undermined the global regime of economic and financial liberalization that has served the postwar world so well. Faced with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the European Community, Japan is considering forming a new regional group with itself at the center. Other countries are also looking for a regional club to join.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House portrayed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a way to gain an edge on Western Europe and Japan, both beset by economic stagnation. This was the wrong reason to argue for completion of a North American deal. Western Europe and Japan, our principal security and economic partners, are in trouble; their cooperation is indispensable for global progress. They are not mere commercial rivals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Salinas and his Institutional Revolutionary Party will now face slightly less pressure to conduct genuinely honest elections next year. His economic liberalization will doubtless continue, and Mexico probably will not revert to hyper-nationalist policies. But the cost will be high: one-party, oligarchic domination for yet another six years by corrupt conquistadores posing as statesmen and national leaders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada, always something of a bystander in the three-way negotiations, must decide what it will do about the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions Mr. Clinton imposed on its products as he sought farm-state votes for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The new Government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, already forced to cope with Quebec separatism, may have little choice but to respond in kind to what Canadians consider bullying tactics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> victory saves him from immediate damage to his Presidency. But the price he paid for victory will be steep. It includes billions in spending obligations to buy key House votes. And his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> actions against Canada and other partners will make it more difficult to complete the GATT deal on time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's confrontation with the labor movement over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may well poison his relationship with it, at least for the time being, and make it harder to advance his health care reforms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His incredible promise to House Republicans that he would protect them next year if they were attacked for pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> votes cannot be kept. It has angered members of his party and core Democratic constituencies whose concerns go beyond <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Administration would do well to curtail its recent boasting that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will send a message to Japan and Europe\" and force them into high-noon concessions in the final stages of the GATT talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> victory will be hollow if Mr. Clinton uses it to try to bulldoze the rest of the world in the Pacific talks in Seattle -- and then at the GATT talks -- into accepting U.S. commercial ultimatums. America's choice about GATT, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, will provide real proof of whether we are optimistic and open or defeatist and closed.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429360273.xml", "text": "<h2>Running Scared From Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only one Democrat in the House from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut -- Nita Lowey, who represents parts of Westchester, Queens and the Bronx -- supports the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico. What accounts for the near-united opposition, even from such ardent free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs as Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Charles Schumer of Brooklyn?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most opponents profess anxiety about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s impact on the local economy. But in private, some admit that their opposition owes more to calculations of political survival than to judgments of economic merit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Local Democrats fear the wrath of organized labor. And well they should. As the accompanying table shows, labor political action committees contribute handsomely to their election campaigns. Though it's impossible to say just how much the PAC money explains opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, there's an unsettling pattern.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would eliminate tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among the three countries over 15 years. This would spur economic gains, but the primary benefit is political: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would lock Mexico into market reforms that could weaken the ruling party's authoritarian grip. Rejection would undermine Mr. Clinton's Presidency and his ability to negotiate other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on parts of the local economy could be beneficial. Some low-wage manufacturing jobs in the garment industry, for example, will be lost. But for every job lost to Mexican imports there will be at least one job created in export industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New York State exported over $1 billion worth of goods -- scientific instruments, chemical products, electronic equipment -- to Mexico last year, and that number will rise rapidly under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would also open up Mexico to U.S. banks, securities and telecommunications companies and exporters of management and other services, areas in which New York City excels. And the agreement provides strong protection for copyrights, patents and other intellectual materials -- exports that are vital to the current and future health of the New York City economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why, then, have almost all local Democrats turned their backs on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Besides the PAC money, labor's endorsement is often key to electoral victory in the New York metropolitan region. And labor hasn't been bashful about threatening to retaliate against representatives who stray on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.  In times of economic distress, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s potential victims, no matter how few in number, will know who these politicians are and blame them for any job losses. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s beneficiaries -- for example, the low-income families that would gain the most from low-cost imports of clothes and food -- are spread out all over the region, are less well organized and don't have anything as dramatic as their jobs at stake. And many workers have been convinced -- wrongly -- that their jobs are on the line, leaving politicians fearful that they will be blamed for every plant closing whatever the reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats might have supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had they been backed early and hard by the White House. But Mr. Clinton started campaigning late. He didn't pressure Democrats to fall in line, so many declared themselves against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and can't now easily reverse course. But perhaps one or two -- as well as the many undecided Democrats and Republicans outside New York -- will decide to stand up to pressure and vote yes tomorrow. If so, voters should give them credit for courage -- and doing what's in their own long-term interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Labor's Money\" Congressional opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> from the New York metropolitan area, northern New Jersey and Connecticut who have received more than $150,000 in campaign contributions from labor political action committees (PACs) since 1983.

{"id": "432679700.xml", "text": "<h2>And Now There Are Two</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On behalf of all the states that have not yet gone to the polls this year, we're pleased to see that the Democratic primary will still be chugging along when March arrives. True, the crowd has thinned. True, we already know the last man standing is going to be a U.S. senator named John. But in an age when too many elections seem to boil down to a choice between the unimaginable and the hardly bearable, the chance to pick between two perfectly good candidates for the presidential nomination seems like a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a campaign that began with a love affair between Howard Dean and the angry Democratic base, things have taken a peculiar and definitely dispassionate turn. John Kerry and John Edwards don't seem to disagree on many policy issues, and until now, they have avoided attacking each other. Voters probably like the positive spin the race is taking, but they may also have a nagging feeling that unpleasant surprises are being deferred: bits of biography, personal tics, hard-to-explain votes. What's best known about the two surviving candidates is that Mr. Kerry is a Vietnam combat veteran who seems like a winner, and that Mr. Edwards is a millworker's son who strikes some as even more electable than the front-runner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Edwards has a terrific stump speech -- people who see him for the first time frequently come away smitten. People who see him 10 or 12 times will discover that he has a talent for staying on message that makes even George Bush look unguarded. His political resume is short: the current Senate term he is completing is his first public office. On the plus side, that means Mr. Edwards has a relatively short record of votes with the potential to haunt him during a long campaign. (When he points out, as he now does constantly, that he didn't vote for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Mr. Edwards does not add that when the Senate passed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, he was still a lawyer in North Carolina.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Kerry, who has been in the Senate since 1985, has a far longer paper trail and a harder time restraining himself from wandering off into the complexities of an issue. Listeners can find his explanation of why he voted for President Bush's war resolution either deeply nuanced or practically endless. But his gravitas and long experience with foreign policy issues might provide reassurance to a jittery electorate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards deserves -- and frequently demands -- credit for speaking so consistently about the problems of the poor and the continuing challenge of racial discrimination in America. He is more conservative than Mr. Kerry about the amount he is willing to commit to a national health care plan. He supports the death penalty, and Mr. Kerry opposes it -- except when it comes to terrorists. Their positions on gay marriage are slightly different and hard to parse, but both come down somewhere in the general area of civil unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both men have shown a willingness to take a dive on principle to advance ambition. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry both followed up their support for the Iraq resolution with a vote against the $87 billion authorization needed to support American troops there and in Afghanistan. And it's too bad that their fiercest competition is a battle to see who can outpander the other on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Mr. Edwards hammered hard on Mr. Kerry's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vote as he wooed blue-collar workers in Wisconsin, and Mr. Kerry picked up the theme, lashing out at George Bush's economic adviser for daring to suggest that there are positive aspects to outsourcing jobs abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards has won only one primary to Mr. Kerry's 15, but he had a critical victory over expectations in Wisconsin. In the current political culture, nearly winning a supposedly one-sided race counts for a lot. Bill Clinton, after all, became the ''Comeback Kid'' when he succeeded in coming back to second place in New Hampshire. The chances of an Edwards ascendancy still seem minuscule. No candidate with Mr. Kerry's kind of lead has lost a nomination since the modern primary system began.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, we have lived through a lot of impossibilities since this time four years ago, and have stopped counting on the normal thing happening. Besides, we are very glad we're getting the chance to vote.</p>\n"}

A quarter-century-old dispute over Canadian lumber exports, which Washington claims are unfairly subsidized, has escalated to the point where it now threatens broader relations between the two countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it remains unresolved, the softwood war might also spill over into the December ministerial meeting of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization, where Washington and Ottawa have long worked together to expand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. What kind of example does it set for the rest of the world if the United States and Canada -- close neighbors, each other's largest trading partner and crucial allies -- cannot resolve their own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American and Canadian lawyers, lobbyists and negotiators have been fighting on and off over Canadian lumber exports to the United States since the 1980's. In 1982, a coalition of 250 American lumber mills claimed that Canadian provinces were subsidizing lumber exports by charging set ''stumpage fees'' -- the price forest companies paid when harvesting standing timber -- while American mills were paying open market prices. While the fight over things like stumpage fees is complex enough, it got a sharp twist in 2000 when Congress passed an amendment giving American companies injured by foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> the punitive duties imposed by the United States, which in the case of Canadian lumber exports now amount to about $5 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that the right of the United States to impose such duties is in dispute, or that the W.T.O. declared the Byrd amendment (named after its creator, Senator Robert C. Byrd) illegal. American and Canadian officials now face two lumber disputes: the old one about timber management practices; and the new one about who owns the money held by the Treasury. Making things uglier are conflicting decisions by a panel convened under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and by the W.T.O., with the United States claiming that favorable rulings by the latter trump adverse rulings by the former.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canadians, including the normally friendly Canadian business community, are particularly outraged that Washington has rejected the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel decision. In Canadian eyes, this refusal by the United States betrays the central deal that underpinned <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the first place: Canada allowed unfettered access to its energy resources and an end to restrictions on American investment in return for a binding method of settling disputes. As Prime Minister Paul Martin made clear recently, the dispute is coloring everything from the oil and gas <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy to the United States) to cooperation in the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Canada and the United States cannot bring their common heritage and collective ingenuity to resolve the lumber dispute, little hope remains for commercial differences in other areas, or in other parts of the world. With this in mind, we have two suggestions, one to dispose of the $5 billion pot held by the American Treasury, the other to bridge the ancient battle over lumber exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the $5 billion. We recommend that a bilateral trust should administer the funds for the benefit of the North American industry as a whole. Representatives of Canadian and American lumber companies, and the two governments, would manage the trust. Possible projects: scientific research, pest control, forest fire control and re-structuring assistance, especially for smaller mills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, we believe that President Bush and Prime Minister Martin should each appoint a special envoy with the authority to negotiate a final and durable compromise by a date certain, say June 2006. The idea is to elevate the issue to the highest level, removing it from the present negotiating framework where vested interests exercise far too much influence. We have in mind envoys of the stature of James Baker from the United States and Derek Burney from Canada, who brokered the original Canada-United States free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal in the 1980's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These envoys would be charged with specific instructions: agree on limits on the Canadian share of the American lumber market that would gradually expand over time; settle the terms for market-based adjustments to the Canadian stumpage system while making provisions for the environment; and hammer out the details for managing the $5 billion pot. As part of the package, all legal actions would be halted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two heads of government should commit in advance to backing whatever agreement their envoys reach within these overall terms. The grand bargain that was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be returned to pride of place in our relations. Not only would this restore confidence in the strength of the North American partnership, it would strengthen both countries' efforts to promote free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> worldwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Joseph Hart)</p>\n"}

John Edwards likes to talk about how <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ''have hurt workers and families while helping corporate insiders.'' Senator Hillary Clinton has suggested that the economic theories underpinning the cause for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> no longer hold, and has said she would review all of the United States' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even Republican candidates -- normally staunch supporters of expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- can sound skeptical. ''I don't want to see our food come from China, our oil come from Saudi Arabia and our manufacturing come from Europe and Asia,'' complained Mike Huckabee. Mitt Romney defends globalization's record of improving living standards, but cannot resist drawing an applause line by adding that the government should negotiate better with other countries to make sure ''the American worker gets a fair shake.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be unfortunate for the United States if the winner of the 2008 election elevated skepticism toward <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> from a red-meat sound bite on the campaign trail to a new wave of protectionist policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans are experiencing economic anxiety. Wages for most workers are going nowhere. It is a sad fact that despite enormous gains in productivity over the past few decades, the wages of typical workers are only marginally higher than they were a quarter of a century ago. But throttling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- say, by reconsidering existing agreements -- would hurt a lot more people than it helped. There is scant evidence that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has played a big role in holding down typical workers' wages. There is abundant evidence that it has contributed substantially to America's overall economic growth. It offers American producers access to foreign markets. It multiplies choices for producers and consumers. Foreign competition spurs productivity growth at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, like technological change, can produce wrenching dislocations that hurt some workers. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers are not the proper tool to deal with these changes. What is needed is a bold strategy to rebuild a functioning safety net, deploying some of the vast wealth this nation has gained through globalization to assist those hurt by the forces of economic change. This will allow Americans to embrace globalization, rather than fear it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The planks of this strategy include health care reform, to ensure that workers who lose their jobs do not also lose access to affordable health insurance, and a form of extended unemployment insurance for all displaced workers, not just those hurt by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. More progressive taxation -- using tools like the earned income tax credit -- should be used to address the stagnation of incomes. And more should be spent on the continuous training and education of workers throughout their lives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is unclear whether the next president will have the vision to carry through these changes. The Republican candidates' posturing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has been pretty much substance-free. But considering the field's uniform approach to economic policy, in which all taxes are bad and most nondefense spending is worse, it is unlikely that a Republican president would be interested in investing in such an expansion of America's social safety net.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic candidates, on the other hand, tend to be on the right side of the discussion on issues like universal health care, education and social spending. But all of them have included hints of defensive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies amid their proposals. Barack Obama has offered the most resistance to the easy path of blaming imports from foreign countries for the woes of the American middle class. ''Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not going away, technology is not going away, the Internet is not going away,'' he said in New Hampshire. ''And that means enormous opportunities, but also means more dislocations.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mrs. Clinton proposes a ''timeout'' on future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, including the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization's global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, and a reconsideration of existing deals -- including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a cornerstone of Bill Clinton's presidency. Mr. Edwards also talks of ''redoing'' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. All the Democratic candidates agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements should be amended to attach provisions about minimum labor standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These changes would do virtually nothing to protect American workers from the disruptions wrought by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, technology and other economic forces. A protectionist agenda would hurt them.</p>\n"}
