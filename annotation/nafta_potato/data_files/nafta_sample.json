{"id": "2127863944.xml", "text": "<h2>Don't forget the shy Trumpers</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paul Theroux is the author, most recently, of \"Figures in a Landscape: People and Places.\"OAXACA, MEXICO</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ihave quite a lot of sympathy for certain Trump voters, and (wait, please, let me finish) I've been making a list of some concerns that Donald Trump the candidate (I beg you to stop interrupting me - this won't take long) raised when he was on the campaign trail and in the White House. If the Democrats (thank you, I appreciate your patience) ignore these subjects, they risk losing next week and in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president got my attention in September when the subject of new tariffs on China arose - tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. Certain Apple products that might have been affected were ultimately excluded after the company objected. Still, Trump had told Apple, with a characteristic snarl on Twitter, \"Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apple obviously would regard the demand as a punitive one, likely to reduce the profits of a trillion-dollar company that depends on the sweat of poorly paid Chinese labor and the connivance of Chinese commissars whose oppressive policies are well-known and widely publicized. Yet Trump's point is a fair one: Why not make Apple products here? Anyone driving the side roads of America sees towns put out of work because manufacturing went elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's winning pitches as a candidate called attention to these towns, and he was cheered as he gave speeches in them, promising to revitalize them by renegotiating the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Having just spent two years traveling in Mexico, I agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was deeply flawed, though not in ways that Trump cares about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies that moved their manufacturing to Mexico are prospering, but their workers there barely make ends meet. The exploitation of labor in the maquiladoras in border towns is a disgrace - the visible obscenity of American factories a few hundred yards over the border at, say, Mexicali or Ciudad Juarez or Reynosa, merely to allow these companies to pay workers $8.50 a day, making everything from airplane components to automobile seat belts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's recent renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>won't do much to change things, which makes it all the more important for Democratic candidates to understand the deal's inequities, the fundamental one being that it put American workers out of jobs while exploiting Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration policy is flawed too, and the subject of migration misunderstood. No, the answer is not building the Murus Hadrianus Trumpus at the border, but the problem is far greater than the stereotype of Mexicans swimming across the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, Mexican immigration has plunged in recent years, but there has been a surge in undocumented migrants from Central America, as with the thousands of Hondurans making their way north through Mexico en masse toward the United States over the past several days. Add to these unfortunates the many so-called special-interest aliens</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>, Chinese who pay a small fortune to sneak through tunnels into California, or the undocumented Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Syrians, Iraqis, Nigerians and Afghans sitting in detention centers. The creators of so-called sanctuary cities who embrace migrants might rethink their role if they considered harboring the Chinese migrant who paid $70,000 to be guided by a cartel member under the border through a tunnel to a safe house in Calexico or San Ysidro.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's hostility to immigration and his appeal to old-fashioned Americana is seen as nativist and sometimes racist. This is a delicate subject, but the question of roots has been a theme in elections in Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Britain, and to say it is irrelevant is a mistake. Anyone who came of age in 1950s America has witnessed a doubling of the U.S. population and an enormous cultural shift. Its upside is diversity, of course; its downside is an erosion of historical memory, and culture shock.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, it's a pity that young immigrants, and plenty of young people generally, have never heard of Elvis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins or Annette Funicello. It's of greater concern to me that the names Emmett Till and Rosa Parks are so seldom invoked; that there is so little awareness of America's tradition of dissent, or of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s hope to live in a nation where people \"will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To write off Trump's message, or to see his voters as racist and deplorable, is to miss the point. It is not that the Democrats' elite are geriatrics, though they certainly are; it is that they are too entrenched, too tone deaf and out of touch in myriad ways. The Clintons need to retire to discover the ambiguous pleasures of obscurity that the rest of us already know. Barack Obama is as eloquent as ever, and inspirational, but he needs to understand the dismay many of us feel when seeing him and his fellow Democrats taking money from big companies that outsource work and exploit foreign workers, all the while sucking up to celebrities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A blue wave is predicted for the midterms. I'm not convinced of it. Trump proved most polls wrong for a reason. In Britain, a shy Tory is someone who will not reveal his or her intended vote to a pollster. There are many loud Trumpers, but there are shy Trumpers, too. So I distrust polls more than ever, especially as - after Trump won, and voters became more vocal - I discovered that many in my large and lovable and liberal-minded family, and maybe yours too, revealed themselves as shy Trumpers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paul Theroux is the author, most recently, of \"Figures in a Landscape: People and Places.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: ;Paul Theroux</p>\n"}

It's another issue where there's no way for the president to wave a wand and make everyone happy, especially when so many people like the status quo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, a major overhaul of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could prove to be even more elusive than the repeal of Obamacare. Congressional Republicans scuttled repeal even though they all opposed Obamacare -- and most of them do not oppose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

{"id": "2097396349.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA is dead. Long live NAFTA.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement took effect in 1994, it was widely regarded \u2014 by friend and foe alike \u2014 as an ambitious experiment in economic engineering. To advocates, it promised the benefits of stronger economic growth for its three member countries: Canada, Mexico and the United States. To its adversaries, it threatened the loss of well-paid U.S. manufacturing jobs to low-wage countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even before he was president, Donald Trump was among <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s fiercest critics. During the campaign, he pledged to overhaul or terminate it. Now he has fulfilled his promise, unveiling a new, tentative U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. Critics say it will raise car prices, while Trump and his allies argue that it will promote good U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's next task is to coerce or cajole Canada into joining the agreement and then killing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> label. \"I like to call this deal the United States-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. I think it's an elegant name,\" he said in a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \"I think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has a lot of bad connotations for the United States, because it was a rip-off.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But by whatever label, any revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement will look a lot like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The Trump administration contends that it made breakthroughs in protecting \"intellectual property\" (patents, copyrights, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets) and in opening markets for digital technology. Time will tell whether these claims amount to much. Otherwise, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s major accomplishment \u2014 eliminating most tariffs among the three countries \u2014 would remain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one area where the new agreement is starkly more protectionist involves cars and trucks. All along, Trump has aimed to shift more production from low-wage countries to the high-wage United States. He would achieve this goal by imposing a variety of conditions that car manufacturers would have to meet to be exempt from a 2.5 percent tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the local content of these qualifying autos \u2014 required production in North America \u2014 would be raised from the existing level of 62.5 percent to 75 percent. Next, there would be a requirement that between 40 percent and 45 percent of the autos' content would have to come from workers earning at least $16 an hour. This would be a huge boost for many Mexican autoworkers, whose hourly pay averages about $3, reports The Washington Post's Heather Long. By contrast, U.S. autoworkers average more than $22 an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point, says an administration fact sheet, is to \"support better jobs for United States producers and workers by requiring that a significant portion of vehicle content be made with high-wage labor.\" The content requirements would pressure many auto part suppliers to keep their operations in the United States or to relocate factories that had moved abroad to return, according to the fact sheet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is this all, says economist Jeffrey J. Schott of the Peterson Institute, a critic of the agreement. \"There are layers and layers of requirements,\" he notes. For example, 70 percent of the steel, aluminum and glass in vehicles must come from North American sources.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the requirements are so complex that many auto companies may decide that complying with them is not worth the trouble, Schott says. Companies might determine that paying the 2.5 percent tariff is the least costly alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, that might not be the end of the story. Trump is also considering raising car tariffs as high as 25 percent because the industry is said to be vital to national security. This would, quite probably, result in hefty price increases and dampened production, hurting American consumers, workers and auto companies. In the worst of all possible worlds, everyone loses.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429146035.xml", "text": "<h2>Demythologizing the Trade Pact</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has been overheated. Critics proclaim the pact -- which would eliminate most tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers with Mexico and Canada over the next 15 years -- a national catastrophe, threatening jobs, wages and the environment. Proponents claim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will boost employment and that its environmental provisions are a lovely shade of green.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth is more mundane. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would have a modest economic impact in Mexico but a trivial impact on the U.S. economy. Mexico is too small to threaten U.S. firms, and U.S. tariffs are already so low that elimination couldn't possibly lead to a flood of Mexican imports. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> spells neither economic salvation nor ruin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will jobs disappear? Ross Perot warns that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will take jobs away from up to six million Americans -- based on the absurd calculation that the agreement threatens every worker in industries that use a lot of labor. The Administration says that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will boost employment. Neither is correct.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> pacts affect where people work, not how many people work. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, more Americans would find work in service industries (like insurance) and high-tech manufacturing (computers) for export to Mexico; fewer Americans would work in glass-blowing and apparel industries that would lose out to Mexican imports. But overall employment would not change. With or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. employment rate will again hover around 6 percent once the economy recovers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, the workers displaced by Mexican imports won't be the ones who find the extra work in export industries. Fortunately, the number of displaced workers would be small. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, over 10 years, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would add fewer than 500,000 to the 20 million workers who'll be displaced for other reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will wages shrink? Mr. Perot warns that U.S. firms will flee to Mexico to hire low-paid workers; employers who stay will drive down wages to Mexican levels. Some employers will relocate, but Mr. Perot's numbers are cockamamie. Most studies predict foreign investment in Mexico, an economy only one-twentieth the size of the U.S., would rise by no more than about $15 billion a year -- a tiny fraction of the $500 billion investment in plant and equipment that takes place every year in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides, low wages primarily reflect low productivity, giving companies little reason to relocate -- otherwise Haiti would rule the corporate world. And because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is expected to increase U.S. exports, it is as likely to raise U.S. wages as lower them -- though in neither case by very much.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will the environment suffer? Critics charge that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will encourage U.S. firms to relocate to take advantage of Mexico's notoriously lax enforcement of environmental laws. The threat is real but small. Few firms face compliance costs larger than 1 percent of total costs, which is too small to warrant the journey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are legitimate questions about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s environmental impact: Does <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> adequately protect U.S. health and safety standards; will it protect the environment along the border? And critics have rightly pointed to the agreement's weak environmental dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms. But there's still time to make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> better when the Clinton Administration negotiates a supplemental accord on the environment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> raise troubling questions because they break with the honorable U.S. tradition of treating all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners alike. But Canada and Mexico are special cases because they are neighbors. And <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would help Mexico lock in recent market reforms that the U.S. supports. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't an economic magic bullet, but it does some good and no great harm.</p>\n"}

Yet, Zedillo does not appear overwhelmed. Indeed, he is no longer the accidental candidate who filled the political vacuum created by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, his party's presidential candidate, in March 1994. Zedillo confidently predicts that he will pull his country out of its state of emergency in the near future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately for him, such confidence is not widely shared in other quarters of Mexico--especially where there are strong doubts about Zedillo's abilities as a leader.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until now, the Zedillo administration, with public support, has been able to pass most of the blame for the country's ills onto the previous administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. This has given Zedillo the freedom to make progress on some key fronts. He has adjusted the economy to a devalued peso and brought about the start of a recovery. He has successfully negotiated an agreement among Mexico's major political parties to achieve political reform. He has strengthened the muscle of the judiciary branch by reconstituting the supreme court and purging the ranks of the corrupted federal police. He has called in the military to cleanse Mexico City's police force. He claims to have captured the hired guns who killed Colosio and another prominent politician.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These accomplishments are undeniable, but Zedillo is still far from achieving success. Jobs lost during the severe economic recession have not been replaced. Businesses that went belly up after the peso was devalued in December 1994 have not reopened. His handling of the economy has drawn strong political opposition, even from within his own party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). A persistent wave of criminal violence, fed, in large part, by drug trafficking, plagues Mexico's cities and towns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there are Mexico's two continuing insurrections. In Chiapas, talks with Subcomandante Marcos and his Zapatistas have been suspended. In southern and central Mexico, an especially violent revolutionary group, known as the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), recently staged a series of daring attacks in six Mexican states, leaving 16 dead.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sitting in his office at Los Pinos, Zedillo, trim and fit, discussed these enormous problems sounding more like a scientist than a politician--but never ducking an opportunity to take on his critics. Yet, for many Mexicans, the question is whether their president has the fire to exercise the kind of authority needed to govern Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Question: You have made a distinction between the EPR and the Zapatistas. And, in fact, you have a strange type of official relationship with the Chiapas group. The government allows an armed group of people who want to overthrow the government to organize tours for Hollywood movie-makers. What is going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answer: Well, in Chiapas we are half-way solving the problem. We want to reach an agreement in which the government accepts the just social and political claims of this group and, in return, they disarm and join the political route to participate in the civic life of the country. In between, there is no violence, they keep their arms and are free to organize their propaganda activities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Violence, however, has made a comeback and many analysts believe the national-security apparatus in Mexico has collapsed since 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Violence has many varieties and is surfacing. But this is happening not only in Mexico. There seems to be a new wave of violence worldwide--sometimes even promoted by the media. In Mexico, we have had political assassinations, and we don't know yet what were the causes for those murders, because they are extremely complicated cases. The investigation continues its course. Regarding violence perpetrated by common criminals, the explanation is that our laws have been too lenient and our institutions have failed because they have not grown as the country has grown. Some of these institutions have been corrupted. So we're adjusting our laws to the times we are living in and reforming our institutions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Regarding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, there is a genuine concern of a sector of society, but some people are also using it for political gain. Do you see it that way?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I have always condemned the sensationalization and the extra-legal pressures used in this case. Almost every week, there is a new hypothesis of the killing. Everybody has the right to express an opinion, but sensationalism and extra-legal pressures dilute the search for truth and the achievement of justice. Some people would like me to become prosecutor and judge; to do so would be illegal and useless. What I have done, as president, is to ensure the absolute independence of the judiciary system . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: I know you don't believe there is a conspiracy in place since 1994, but do you believe there is a power struggle going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: No. I honestly don't believe there is a power struggle going on. It would be easy for me to say that the problems I face are the byproducts of a conspiracy, but that would be a lie . . . . Each one of the troubles we've gone through has its own logic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In Mexico, the government is blamed for every problem, whether it is poverty or inequality or unemployment. What do you see as your responsibility?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility began Dec. 1, 1994, but the government has to confront each one of these problems. Poverty is a 500-year-old problem, but it is my problem now. Regarding our economic problems, I think they began three years ago. We went through a process of accumulation until the crisis burst . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: The crisis began three years ago?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes. We had a very high deficit in the current-account {balance} in 1992, '93 and '94, and we allowed ourselves to reach a situation that led us to the crisis. But that is irrelevant. Now that is my problem and I must solve it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: However, in April 1994, you told me, \"After 10 years of macroeconomic adjustments, we can now tell the people they will reap the benefits after so much sacrifice.\" Either you did not know what was happening or there were mistakes later. Also troubling is the fact that you were the programming and budget secretary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes, but up until 1991.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But you were the candidate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: That is a good question and let's deal with it. To run into a crisis, you have to link a series of events that individually would hardly create a crisis. It is like an accident. We had a serious dependency on foreign capital. Some saw this flow of capital as a positive sign, as a symbol of economic vitality, of confidence in our country. However, when some events shook the confidence of the foreign investor, the flow was read in a different light. Remember, the money for these so-called emergent markets came from new and different sources, the stock exchange, pension funds, etc. Nobody knew how they would behave in an emergent market if a given situation would turn out different from the norm. These were the factors we had to confront . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason why we are coming out of this national emergency is precisely because the Mexican economy has a structural strength it had never had. After the 1982 crisis, it took us seven years to begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, because our economy back then was obsolete, unproductive and incapable of functioning in the current global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you believe there should have been a devaluation before the election?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In retrospect, it is real easy to say that, and it certainly could have been much more comfortable to start my government with an economy in the process of a severe adjustment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But would you have won the election after a devaluation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: The only time I am aware that a devaluation was considered was on Nov. 20, 1994. That was 10 days before my inauguration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What happened in December '94, and who is responsible?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I wish the crisis had been the result of one decision--because it would not have been as big a crisis and it would have been easy to solve. We had a crisis because the country was spending more than it was producing. This took years, and then there were so many more issues involved. We had become addicted to flows of foreign capital, and these represented 7% or 8% of GNP. We also had to pay more than $41 billion in bonds, shares, Tesobonos, Cetes that matured around that date. These problems were not created in one day. We had to adjust the country back to reality and that is precisely what made an impact in the people's living standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some critics say you have a long-term vision, to build up an efficient, competitive economy, whereas the people have short-term needs--they want a job or higher wages. Is this a problem?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility is to work long term, but that does not mean we don't measure the short-term effects of long-term actions. If we had followed an adjustment program in '95, in the short term it would have meant more sacrifices for the people and it would have taken longer to overcome the economic emergency. Gradualism is not an option, because that would have taken us to total collapse and instead of loosing hundreds of thousands of jobs, we would have lost millions. My long-term policy is the best policy in the short term. Promises won't bring food to the table of the people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What most dominates the relationship between Mexico and the United States: conflict or cooperation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: It is a complex relationship that has many facets and many issues, some extremely difficult. This complexity forces a chiaro/oscuro type of relationship. President Clinton is very cooperative and has helped us in the most difficult of times. It took a lot of guts to support Mexico as he did. Fortunately, we have paid them back almost the whole loan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's been respect when dealing with difficult issues--such as drug trafficking or immigration; but both countries have tried to solve problems as they come up. From time to time, we have problems like the Helms-Burton law, which I believe is a big mistake, because it violates international law. That is why it is creating so many problems with Canada, the European Union and us. But Helms-Burton cannot contaminate the whole relationship; I hope we can overcome this problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: President Clinton's special envoy for Cuba, Stuart Eizenstat, said, \"It would be a mistake to bring Helms-Burton into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Did you interpret it as a threat or as a warning?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Maybe he said so because he knows we are right, and the U.S. view is wrong. They are asking us to promote democracy in Cuba; well, they should know Mexico has maintained, consistently for many decades, the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other nations. I believe democracy is the best political system, but I don't believe we have the right to interfere in Cuba's domestic affairs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Has the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement worked well for the United States but not for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has performed very well for its three partners. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> has increased in a meaningful way, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed a difficult test in '95. During the Mexican recession, it is remarkable that our purchases in the U.S. did not fall and are now growing strongly again. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is no longer a topic for debate, because we are not talking theory now, but facts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: After the November election in the U.S., couldn't you find a similar framework that would lead to a treaty on immigration?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: We have always been open to reach a permanent solution to this issue. The problem is that the existing economic disparity between both countries is what causes migration. The real solution will come with economic growth in Mexico, but that will take some time. Meanwhile, we should work out agreements to take care of the real demand for Mexican labor in the U.S. in an environment that respects human rights. This approach is difficult for the U.S., because it would mean legalizing many more immigrants than what is politically feasible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: How would you describe yourself? Are you a weak president, as many people say?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: How arrogant and vain would it be that I define myself. I am not pursuing an \"image,\" because I cannot waste my time on those silly exercises. I have been through the hardest period ever for a president in modern Mexico, and when things are difficult, the people demand miraculous and messianic solutions. I have been responsible in avoiding promises no one can deliver. I have remained truthful through painful times. I try, deliberately, not to make authoritarian use of the presidential powers. One of the imperfections of our democracy has been its lack of equilibrium between the federal powers and among the three branches of government. My contribution has been to open spaces for other powers. Because nobody can accuse me of being a thief or corrupt or abusive, they say I am weak. That's fine. I answer my critics with deeds and tough decisions I have had to make without ever considering my index of popularity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: (ERNESTO ZEDILLO); PHOTOGRAPHER: PETER STONE / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ACCN-79918</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sergio Munoz is an editorial writer for The Times.

{"id": "1878595149.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta Has Made Mexico a Better Place; Civil society, long neutralized during the PRI autarky, has awakened.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One common beef with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is that 23 years after it went live Mexico remains a developing country. Because Mexico's standard of living is still below that of its northern counterparts and a weak rule of law persists, critics argue that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet in this analysis the fault lies with the expectations, not the outcome. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was never going to convert Mexico into a Spanish-speaking Switzerland in one generation. On the other hand, few would have predicted the civil, political and economic achievements of the past two decades. That this has happened while American drug consumers have been financing vicious organized-crime networks in the country is even more impressive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the news in January that Ernesto Canales, the anticorruption czar in the Mexican state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, had jailed former Gov. Rodrigo Medina of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on charges of corruption during his term from 2009-15.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting a powerful member of the PRI behind bars, even temporarily, was a first for the state. Mr. Medina was released the next day by a federal judge on a procedural technicality but he still faces trial on corruption charges that could result in a sentence of up to 36 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter the outcome, Mr. Canales told the Mexican media, politicians are now on notice. Making a play on words in Spanish with the Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" he warned that Mexico's \"100 years of impunity\" are over.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago Mexico was a one-party state run by the PRI. The authoritarian machine, which had been in power since 1929, had industrialized the country and kept the lid on civilian lawlessness much like Gen. Francisco Franco did in Spain from 1939-75. But the corporatist model, in which the state owned or controlled business and labor organizations, held the nation back. Fiscal mismanagement spawned successive bouts of devaluation and hyperinflation. A repressive state apparatus contained social unrest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the 1980s Mexico looked more like Egypt--poor, backward and undemocratic--than like a member of Western civilization. Democratic capitalists on both sides of the border wanted change. But as the \"Arab Spring\" demonstrated, the transformation from tyranny to liberty requires more than desire.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political reform was not on the agenda when PRI President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in 1988. But the economy was in bad shape, and renewed growth depended on opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Canada. President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to pursue a continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment treaty with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and brought commitments to competition, privatization and foreign capital. Cross-border commercial relationships required improvements in civil law. For the first time in more than six decades, Mexico had the fundamentals of a market economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mexican economist Luis de la Calle and political scientist Luis Rubio show in their 2010 book, \"Mexico: A Middle Class Society</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>,\" today's consumption patterns indicate that the nation is no longer \"poor.\" But this is about more than an increase in creature comforts for a wider number of Mexicans. It is also about the spread of middle-class values in education, civil rights and culture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption went unacknowledged in old Mexico because graft was a party entitlement, the press was controlled by the state and whistleblowers were easily ruined. But 6\u00bd years after the birth of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the PRI lost executive power at the ballot box.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Journal's Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba and Juan Montes reported</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>earlier this month, some state politicians read the end of PRI dominance at the federal level as merely the decentralization of corruption. But they didn't count on how civil society, which had been neutralized during PRI autarky, also awakened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015 Jaime Rodr\u00edguez, a political outsider with no party, was elected governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n on a single issue: ending corruption. He named Mr. Canales to head an independent office, inside the attorney general's office, to investigate corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit to the state capital of Monterrey in February, I met with seven members of the Canales team. They shared with me some of their findings, including what they allege was a sophisticated scheme of \"simulation,\" in which chosen contractors created duplicate billing for infrastructure projects during the Medina term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite a federal prohibition on the right to subpoena state records, Mr. Canales's office collected enough evidence to charge, among other things, that Mr. Medina's administration signed thousands of overpriced public-works contracts with favored companies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Medina maintains his innocence.

{"id": "398349699.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Nafta: Part of the trade-environment solution</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the window of a light aircraft a mile above the Yucatan peninsula, what may be the first environmental effects of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement appear on the landscape below. Orange groves, planted in anticipation of expanding U.S. citrus markets, threaten native forests and the diversity of species that depend upon them. Nevertheless, despite free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s potentially far-reaching environmental impacts, opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may not be an effective way to deal with them. It may, in fact, be counterproductive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a political issue has been highly absorbing for the environmental community. Although assessments of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact very widely, environmentalists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is not something they can afford to ignore. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-driven flows of capital and patterns of resource consumption affect virtually every facet of the environment. As a result, many of the conservation gains of the past two decades could be lost to even small shifts in international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's timber industry provides a good case study. In the country's southeastern region, a number of small-scale, community-run operations manage broad tracts of native forest under a conservation model. While these operations protect a wealth of species and ecological functions, they operate in the economic margin and are endangered by shifting terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As tariffs decline, these operations are at economic risk from timber industries in the U.S. and Canada. To minimize market losses, forest producers in Mexico face increasing pressure to cut more trees and concentrate operations in scarce old-growth forests where they can obtain the highest-value timber. The environmental cost of competing with the U.S. timber industry is simply too great. And, as is occurring now in the Yucatan, pressure to convert land to citrus and beef for American markets may accelerate forest loss.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The forest-into-citrus scenario is instructive for several reasons. First, it shows that the environmental impacts of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> may be felt far beyond the highly-polluted border area which has so preoccupied U.S. environmental groups. Second, it demonstrates that enforcement of U.S.-style laws in Mexico is not a magic solution; <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment effects are too diffuse, often lying beyond the reach of existing legal regimes. Finally, it lends some needed perspective to the claim that U.S. industry standards for environmental protection are always superior to Mexican standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the contrary, Mexican small-scale forestry operations are ecologically preferable to single-species tree plantations in the U.S. that support comparatively little wildlife. This last point deserves mention in the U.S. environment-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate, which has too often digressed into a nationalist -- sometimes protectionist -- dialogue, with inadequate appreciation of the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by Mexico. The real situation is likely to be much less one-sided, with impacts, good and bad, on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, if forest loss in Mexico is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> outcome, why should an environmental group support <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? The answer lies in the fact that the changes that many fear will ensue as a result of the treaty are happening already, even without a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. Mexican timber producers are under pressure now from increasing imports of cheaper American wood, as a result of tariff reductions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. Furthermore, land has been cleared along its Gulf coast since the 1980s for citrus exports under a more liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> regime in that sector. Much the same can be said about the maquiladora factories that line the heavily-polluted border region; they, too, have flourished without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we are serious about addressing these and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment impacts we must work to reform the economic forces behind them, and we must do so at the international level. But while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements are a logical point to confront our economic and environmental contradictions, they are not, strictly speaking, the cause of them. This should lead environmentalists to ask: If blocking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will not stem the environmental impacts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, can it provide the basis for beginning to resolve them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps it can. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents often assert that an increase in financial resources flowing to Mexico will raise its environmental protection standard. Indeed it is widely recognized that poverty leads to degradation of the natural environment. While increasing financial resources alone does not guarantee a cleaner environment, it at least provides an opportunity to pursue one-given sufficient political will.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, in Mexico the political will is strong. The environmental record of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been justifiably commended for its effort to harmonize environmental standards, and to enforce them more evenly. No administration in recent history has taken, at the highest levels, bolder steps for the conservation of Mexico's rich biological diversity. The receptiveness of the Mexican government to environmental concerns is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose, if we truly care about the future of environments outside our own borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How good is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the environment? It has been called \"the greenest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement ever.\" While this may be true, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is silent on many key environmental issues, such as the environmental effects of commodity price shifts on land use and the like. These are questions that need to be addressed by all parties -- Canadians, Mexicans and U.S. officials -- in an open forum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key component of negotiations on a much-needed environmental side agreement for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the creation of a special commission on the North American environment. An important role of the commission would be to monitor the effects of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in order to find cooperative solutions to environmental issues across the continent. That is not everything, but it is something essential for the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is accompanied by a strong environmental side agreement, it can provide the basis for long-term environmental improvements throughout North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Fuller is president of World Wildlife Fund.</p>\n"}

It's a sought-after job, with autoworkers in Mexico earning an average of about $5 an hour, compared with the nation's minimum wage of less than $4 for the whole day. Yet it is a fifth of what autoworkers make in Detroit, and that has helped Mexico become a global powerhouse in car production. The finished products can be seen in the parking lot: thousands of shiny new S.U.V.s, black, white, silver, red, waiting to be shipped around the planet, particularly to the United States, where Americans bought 100,000 Journeys last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scenes like this are at the heart of the populist, anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rage driving Donald J.

The president of the United Auto Workers, Dennis Williams, said she promised him that she would renegotiate the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How these attacks on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> translate into policy is one of the most important questions to come out of this election. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-bashing rattles Mexican businesses in a nation that has built its economy on the accord and depends on commerce with its northern neighbor for a third of its income. Last year, Mexico exported $316 billion worth of goods and services to the United States, a sizable chunk of the country's gross domestic product of $1.1 trillion. Amid the election, some companies have delayed related investments, a Mexican financial newspaper reported. And when Mr. Trump goes up in the polls, Mexico's peso sinks in value.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mexican leaders mock Mr. Trump's demand that they pay for a border wall, they have taken his calls to renegotiate, if not scrap, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> more seriously, especially as their leader has done little to push back. In July, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto held a news conference with President Obama in which he said there was space to \"modernize\" and \"update\" the agreement. And last month, he raised no objections when Mr. Trump stood in Mexico's presidential palace and promised a rewrite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not, however, universally beloved in Mexico, and the presidential candidates' anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talk has reignited criticism of the treaty, with some opponents claiming, among other things, that it devastates Mexican agriculture by flooding the country with cheap American corn. In August, tens of thousands of small farmers gathered in Mexico City with demands that included the redrafting of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- a move that Mexico's economy secretary, Ildefonso Guajardo, has warned could open a \"Pandora's box.\" Indeed, the prospect of a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has pundits weighing in with calls to put everything from energy to immigration into a new draft.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In July, the polling company Buend\u00eda y Laredo asked Mexicans if they would like to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether. A solid 52 percent said they were against a \"Mexit\" from the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc, but it was significant that 33 percent said they favored an out, despite how many jobs depended on it. The survey showed similar attitudes to those in Britain toward the European Union; those with the least education were the most against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; college students were the most in favor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> politics are as complex south of the border as they are in the north. Its advocates see it as a cornerstone of Mexico's opening to the world; its detractors, as a neoliberal tool of imperialist gringos. Some credit it -- or blame it -- for most of what has happened here over the last two decades, from the country's moving to a multiparty democracy, to millions trekking to El Norte, to violent drug gangs ravaging border towns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the United States economy 10 times the size of Mexico's, the effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are far greater on this side of the river. It has physically reshaped Mexico's landscape, from its growing industrial cities to its emptying farming villages. It rocket-boosted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the countries, from $104 billion in 1994 to $583 billion last year, representing everything from sparkplugs to airplanes to Christmas trees. Thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico has become the biggest carmaker in Latin America, overtaking Brazil in 2014.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite these gains, the Mexican economy is sluggish compared with that of developing countries such as India and China. It has grown by an average of 2.5 percent a year since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a similar level to the decade before it, and below that of the boom years of the 1960s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Holding a magnifying glass to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> reveals other nuances. Mr. Trump likes to point out that Mexico sells more than it buys from the United States, by $58 billion last year. But many of the companies exporting from Mexico are American-owned, so much of the profit goes back north. Chrysler opened its factory in Toluca all the way back in 1968, aiming for the Mexican market, then invested $1 billion more in it in 2006 when it had access to American car buyers. And while American corn does flow south, Mexico exported more farm goods to the United States than it imported last year. Small farmers here may be losing out as much to large Mexican ranches as they are to American agribusiness, especially those small farmers harvesting the millions of avocados that Americans scarf up in their game-day guacamole.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These nuances illustrate how interconnected the North American economy has become, and how difficult rewriting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be. Perhaps politicians will use the opportunity to add provisions on labor and the environment to the agreement, a longstanding demand by critics that could have a positive impact. But a major renegotiation that would satisfy the autoworkers, small farmers and other aggrieved groups in both countries would be a herculean task -- assuming the next American president really goes there, whatever he or she promises at election time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IOAN GRILLO   Ioan Grillo is the author of \"Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\" and a contributing opinion writer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Farmers Protesting Against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 2003.

{"id": "421160561.xml", "text": "<h2>NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE; Trade as a Hot Issue Is Down, Not Out</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> died as a grass-roots political issue in America? Have we seen the last of the popular movements against foreign competition that contributed so heavily to the rise of Ross Perot's independent candidacy for the White House at the beginning of this decade?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the surface, it might appear the answer to these questions is yes. The political situation has changed since the early 1990s. Yet there are also signs that the opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could return, in a new and intensified fashion, within the next few years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's look at the confluence of two developments over the last few weeks. Both of them involve the field of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. While each has aroused the passions of selected constituencies in this country, they also have been greeted with seeming indifference by the American public.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, President Clinton is pushing ahead in his drive for \"fast-track\" legislation that will give him the legal authority to negotiate new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords like the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement without having them subject to amendments in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And second, America's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan has begun to spiral upward again, much as it did earlier in this decade. To the consternation of Clinton administration officials, Japan seems unable to make its economy grow these days except through exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These were the sort of phenomena that once electrified the talk-show circuits in this country and were part of the lifeblood of presidential politics. Perot's warnings of the \"giant sucking sound\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would produce as American jobs left for Mexico were a staple of his 1992 campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such views have not disappeared. Author Pat Choate, Perot's vice presidential candidate last year, warned in an interview this week against giving Clinton \"blank-check\" authority over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. \"We're dealing with economies that are really different from ours,\" he said. \"The concept of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Japan or China is absurd on the face of it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Perot himself is a spent force. His political organization, the Reform Party, is ridden with internal divisions. And in general, the intensity that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and Japan attracted in 1993 seems, four years later, to have dissipated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why are things so much quieter now?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One important factor is that the unemployment rate in the United States is much lower than it was five years ago. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is obviously a much more potent political issue when Americans are unable to find jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another way of looking at this political shift is that many of those American companies and workers who were most threatened by foreign competition have already lost and moved on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A big factor is that we restructured our economy,\" says Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute think tank. \"We {the United States} got out of a lot of businesses. There are no U.S. makers of television sets anymore. We closed a lot of auto plants. So the {firms} who were being hurt are not around anymore. Some U.S. industries got wiped out.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another factor is that concerns about the harmful effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been institutionalized. There may be less need now for an independent movement like Perot's, or for expressions of public outrage, because such concerns are being handled better within the existing political system than they were half a decade ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Organized labor, as well as such Democratic congressional leaders as House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), are leading the fight against Clinton's request for \"fast-track\" trading authority. Five years ago, as the American public clamored for action on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalance with Japan, the Bush administration and congressional leaders such as then-House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) tended to minimize or explain away the problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the political dynamics have been reversed. The public seems apathetic, but the Clinton administration is becoming aroused. U.S. officials seem to be preparing new actions aimed at bringing down the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan. \"If the numbers keep going up, then this could become an issue in the next campaigns,\" explains one senior administration official.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Above all, the public debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> isn't ending, but shifting course. Labor and environmental groups and some of Clinton's opponents within the Democratic Party now say they are not trying to stop the globalization of the world economy, but rather are trying to make sure it will be regulated in a civilized fashion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One veteran activist on the Democratic left, Robert L. Borosage of the Campaign for America's Future, points out that at the beginning of the 20th century, the Progressive movement took the lead in pressing for health and safety regulations that would protect workers from exploitation as a new national marketplace emerged in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The real question now is, given a global marketplace, what are the rules?\" asks Borosage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a fair question, one that demonstrates how unlikely it is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will permanently disappear as a political issue in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jim Mann's column appears in this space every Wednesday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: Vice President Gore and President Clinton head to meeting before talks with Congress on 'fast-track' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill.

{"id": "398381418.xml", "text": "<h2>Potomac watch: Gore shakes, Newt rattles, GATT unrolls</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Armed with his Adam Smith necktie, Joe Cobb has tilted at the World Bank and other global bureaucracies for years. Yet last week the Republican economist found himself defending President Clinton's global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact against attacks from a fellow right-thinker, Newt Gingrich.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their unlikely behind-the-scenes scrape portends another political problem for a Clinton White House that never takes the easy route when an ordeal is available. Only a few weeks ago the landmark General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> (GATT) looked like a gimme putt in Congress. But a lack of White House attention has let the tariff-cutting pact drift into jeopardy for this year, and maybe forever if Mr. Clinton doesn't spend some political capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm very concerned,\" says GOP Rep. David Dreier, a California free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r who helped Mr. Clinton win his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> battle. \"I'm hoping to see more effort.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It shouldn't be this hard. Ross Perot is sitting out this fight, at least so far, while unions are applying most of their muscle to labor law and health care. Those intellectual comrades, Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, are lobbing sound bites but sway few votes. Even Dick Gephardt, the Democrats' ranking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> warrior, has suggested he'll support GATT.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe that's why Mr. Gingrich's rebellion caught the White House napping. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> he was Mr. Clinton's savior, delivering 132 GOP votes (to just 102 Democrats). But Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" the de facto House Republican leader raised the specter of lost U.S. sovereignty under GATT. He fretted about the pact's provision for a new World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization (WTO), in which the U.S. \"could be outvoted by Antigua, by Botswana or by Venezuela,\" among other nemeses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm for world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" said the Georgia bulldog, \"but I'm against world government.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Gingrich didn't say was that five days earlier he'd heard a similar spiel from Roger Milliken, the legendary textile protectionist, and Pat Choate, Mr. Perot's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> guru. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mr. Gingrich had broken with Mr. Milliken, who has been a financial supporter of the Georgian's political causes. Has the House's leading Republican gone for a swim in the fever swamps?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cobb, the GOP economist who's studied the GATT text, says yes, because the WTO is no threat to American self-rule. \"It's quite silly,\" he says. \"The WTO has no executive authority; it's a mechanism for settling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes. The argument is a red herring.\" Mr. Cobb works for that famous one-world conspiracy front, the Heritage Foundation. He says he'd shutter both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund if he could, but the WTO is different.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The WTO does have stronger enforcement powers than in the past. But that's exactly what the U.S. sought during seven years of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, so that protectionists would have to abide by sterner global rules. Mr. Gingrich rightly says that power will always trump rules, but the U.S. remains the biggest trading power in the world. Are Botswana and Antigua, to pick just two mortal threats, going to endanger the U.S. with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> reprisals? In any case, say advocates, any substantive change in WTO rules couldn't apply to the U.S. unless Congress agreed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Mr. Gingrich has a better point is in mistrusting White House instincts on such matters. At the GATT signing two weeks ago in Morocco, Vice President Gore sounded his one-world weirdest. The Americans shot down in Iraq \"died in the service of the United Nations,\" he said by way of offering patriotic condolences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That remark raised hackles in a GOP cloakroom already alarmed by the subordination of U.S. policy to the U.N. in Bosnia. Mr. Gore also waxed lyrical about how the WTO will spur \"global dialogue,\" or worse, on world labor and environmental controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, most of the world is more afraid of this Gore agenda than is even Mr. Gingrich, so none of it is going to happen. But someone might tell the veep that his rhetoric only gives red meat to Republicans who want an excuse to oppose GATT. The Clinton administration seems to be making the same mistake it did on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which is to court votes on the left that it probably can't get anyway, while ignoring votes on the right that it needs to prevail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton White House seems unable to sustain a centrist, bipartisan coalition even when it's in its own interests. Instead it always builds from the left first. Many House Republicans remember that Mr. Clinton didn't even single them out for thanks after their votes last time. So perhaps Mr. Gingrich is just issuing a warning to the president not to take GOP votes for granted this time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's no reason to go further and scuttle a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that amounts to one of the largest tariff cuts in world history. A tariff cut is really a tax cut, which is what Republicans are supposed to favor. Mr. Gingrich might even use his leverage to insist that these tariff/tax cuts will so boost <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that they'll produce more, not less, tariff revenue for the government (and thus require no offsetting tax hikes). Maybe Mr. Clinton will agree and christen it the Gingrich Curve -- a good precedent for the next tax debate.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2140860533.xml", "text": "<h2>Bush's Economic Legacy, Little Appreciated Then, Reverberates Today; The 41st president left a substantive economic legacy with his record on deficit reduction and trade liberalization, but the political consequences are much more contentious</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON--Though George H.W. Bush was president</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>for just four years, his economic legacy on taxes, banking and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> reverberate today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush owed his election in 1988 in part to the low inflation and solid growth during the administration of Ronald Reagan, whom Mr. Bush served as vice president. Yet imbalances that took root under Mr. Reagan would haunt his successor's presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One imbalance was the budget deficit. In his losing campaign for the presidential nomination in 1980, Mr. Bush famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply-side tax cuts as \"voodoo economics.\" Yet as vice president he faithfully defended those tax cuts and in his 1988 campaign declared, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* George H.W.

The tax cuts had bequeathed persistent deficits and Congress had passed laws in 1985 and 1987 to trigger across-the-board spending cuts if deficits weren't addressed. To avert those provisions, Democrats, who controlled Congress, insisted that spending cuts be accompanied by tax increases. Mr. Bush acquiesced and broke his pledge in 1990.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have ever since blamed that decision both for the recession that began that year and Mr. Bush's defeat in 1992. Reality is more complicated. The recession was mild, ending in March 1991, long before Mr. Bush would face the voters again. But it didn't feel that way because unemployment continued to rise into 1992. Such jobless recoveries were unheard of at the time but have since become commonplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The jobless recovery can be traced to a second imbalance Mr. Bush inherited: a banking system, including thousands of savings and loan institutions, unable to lend because of bad real-estate loans attributable to lax oversight and haphazard deregulation. Mr. Bush's Treasury officials were preoccupied with cleaning up that mess and implementing sounder regulations. One of them, Jerome Powell, would take those lessons with him to the Federal Reserve where, as chairman, he remains acutely sensitive to how financial imbalances can threaten growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his foreign policy triumphs--driving Iraq out of Kuwait and smoothing the fallout from the end of the Cold War--Mr. Bush lost to Bill Clinton and his relentless focus on the economy. Another factor: a loss of support to third-party candidate Ross Perot. Mr. Perot was motivated in part by opposition to another Bush decision: negotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a watershed in globalization. It was quantitatively less important than the integration of billions of workers from Eastern Europe and China into the global economy, the creation of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 1994, and advances in technology. But as the first free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact between rich and poor countries, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came to symbolize the collision of interests between blue collar workers on one hand and consumers, corporations, and geostrategic cooperation on the other. Opposition to it was a centerpiece of President Trump's campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush left a substantive economic legacy: his record on deficit reduction, bank repair and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization paved the way for the long expansion of the 1990s, budget surpluses and a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> boom. The political consequences are much more contentious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mr. Bush signed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it was up to President Bill Clinton whether to seek its ratification. His decision to do so marked a pivot by Democratic presidents and presidential candidates toward an embrace of globalization and away from the party's blue-collar base. Contemplating how rust-belt workers flocked to Mr. Trump's stridently nationalist message in 2016, many Democrats now regret that pivot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Republicans, Mr. Bush's 1992 loss has become a cautionary tale; inflexible opposition to higher taxes is now integral to the party's identity. No Republican president since has raised taxes. It is one of the few things on which Mr. Trump and his party's establishment agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These political pressures are coming to a boil. There are no longer enough free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs in either party to push globalization forward; the question is whether there are enough to keep it from sliding backward. Mr. Trump has renegotiated a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> yet this past weekend promised to exit from the old agreement even if the new one isn't ratified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tax cut passed by Republicans and signed by Mr. Trump has caused the budget deficit to balloon when a strong economy should be shrinking it, setting up battles over whose programs will be cut and whose taxes will be raised for years to come. Though a product of the divisive climate that prevails today, these tensions all have roots in decisions George H.W. Bush took nearly three decades ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Greg Ip at  greg.ip@wsj.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "409900949.xml", "text": "<h2>Globalization's Deficit</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FIFTEEN YEARS ago it was fashionable to pronounce the eclipse of the nation-state. In a globalized world, power would flow to supranational bodies: to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the European Commission, and even to a United Nations freed from the paralyzing divisions of the Cold War. Today this trend appears exhausted. Supranational institutions are not exactly retreating, but they have run out of forward momentum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with economic institutions. The latest round of tariff- cutting talks under the auspices of the WTO is stalling, not because countries oppose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but because they do not want to make concessions in this multilateral forum. Ambitions to deepen the WTO's power to settle disputes beyond <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> into labor and environmental issues have (fortunately) fizzled, while WTO rulings against protectionist European food regulation or American cotton subsidies don't (unfortunately) cause those policies to be reformed quickly. The same story holds for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In the 1990s there was talk of building <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tribunals on labor and the environment into influential voices. It hasn't happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Monetary Fund is even more diminished. In the 1980s and 1990s, it had a place at the top table, leading the charge for economic reform in developing countries during the years of the debt crisis, then struggling to manage financial crises from East Asia to Russia to Latin America from 1997 to 2001. But now the East Asians have built up financial reserves, partly to withstand future financial shocks without the IMF's assistance. Russia is high on petrodollars. And Brazil and Argentina recently paid off the IMF early in a gesture of independence. The world still faces big international financial issues, from the vast U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit to China's currency manipulation, but the IMF has chosen to duck them. Meanwhile, the World Bank is struggling to define its role in a world awash with private lenders. Its new leader, Paul D. Wolfowitz, wielded power confidently when he was part of the Bush administration, but he is feeling his way along in his new job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political institutions are in no better shape. Because of the rise of China and other big middle-income countries, the annual Group of Eight summits have lost their old claim to represent the world's key players; now that Russia has assumed the G-8 presidency, the forum's credibility has shrunk further still. Far from being reinvigorated by the end of the Cold War, the United Nations is in crisis: It is unable to respond decisively even to extreme moral affronts such as the Darfur genocide. It is tarnished by the oil- for-food scandal. And a laudable effort to modernize its institutions and doctrine petered out last year. The European Union has suffered the rejection of its new constitution at the hands of its voters, and NATO has been irrelevant in Iraq and has moved with imperfect unity and uncertain commitment into Afghanistan. The Bush administration makes no secret of the fact that its strategy in foreign policy is not to build international support through international institutions, but rather to forge coalitions of the willing on an ad hoc basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No doubt the pendulum will swing back again. Some day another global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> round may be completed; Argentina's leaders may trip over their own populism and return begging to the IMF. But for the moment the stalling of international institutions is striking  --  and troubling. Yes, democratic nation-states have more legitimacy and capability than international organizations; yes, they should remain the key units of international relations. But in a world knitted together by modern travel and communications, so many policy challenges cross national borders that institutionalized cooperation among nation-states must grow eventually. Financial crises, state failure, global warming, bird flu, terrorism: In the end there must be more than ad hoc answers to this constant succession of problems.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1871366920.xml", "text": "<h2>A fresh way to do the math on trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing you need to know about the latest controversy involving President Trump's alleged attempt to manipulate economic data for political purposes is that Bernie Sanders probably would have done the same thing, and quite possibly Hillary Clinton, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mainstream economists recoiled at a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that said Trump appointees at the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative want official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances between the United States and various countries rejiggered to make bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits seem larger - and, by implication, Trump's protectionist policies more necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his blog, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and author of a leading economics textbook, responded simply: \"You've got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Per long-standing international economic practice, the headline figure for the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and any other nation has been expressed as the difference between two numbers: the value of U.S. imports from that trading partner and the value of U.S. exports to it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, however, left-wing critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have said that this data point distorts the deals' actual impact. In 2014, 14 Democratic members of the House - including current party-chair candidate and 2016 Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) - wrote to President Barack Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative demanding that he adopt the same math that Trump is reportedly contemplating. One of the first to defend Trump this week was Lori Wallach, a left-wing anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> activist at Public Citizen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do they have a point? Well, kinda sorta. The headline numbers lump together made-in-the-USA exports with goods produced in third countries that enter the United States on their way elsewhere. Example: Samsung TVs from South Korea land at Long Beach, Calif., and get trucked to Tijuana, perhaps after a little repackaging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since these \"re-exports\" by definition aren't made by American workers, critics argue that it's more accurate, in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s impact on U.S. jobs, to focus on the difference between purely made-in-the-USA exports and imports that remain in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would dramatically alter reported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with Mexico and Canada, to which nearly half of all U.S. re-exports go - since those nations border us and don't have tariffs, thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 2016 U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico would have been not $63.1 billion but $115.4 billion, the Journal noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that, no matter how you count it, a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit (or surplus) per se is neither good nor bad - unfashionable though it may be to restate that basic tenet of economic theory amid the current left-right protectionist convergence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> undoubtedly displaced American workers in certain sectors, just as it also created new job opportunities elsewhere - including in the vast logistical chain through which re-exports flow. And it enabled U.S. consumers to access various desirable goods at lower prices than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits are diffuse and the job losses concentrated and acutely felt, of course - a fact of politics, not economics, that Trump's data massage seems designed to exploit. (No final decision has been made, the administration told the Journal.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no legitimate full-disclosure issue here, since the data Trump and his progressive bedfellows prefer is already available from the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission. What they want is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative's imprimatur on their ideology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the rigid distinction between U.S.-made goods - which \"create jobs\" - and all others is breaking down due to global supply chains. Economist Lee Ohanian of UCLA has reported that the production process for certain goods takes them back and forth over the U.S.-Mexico border 14 times before they're ready for market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many imports from China are assembled from inputs made in other countries. Example: the iPhone, whose components come from Japan, Korea, Germany and, indeed, the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ideally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> figures would take the iPhone apart, so to speak, awarding each country in the chain credit for the value its workers added. Analysts at the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are working on just such a \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added\" concept.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their results are tentative, and not fully up to date, but still suggestive: The United States' value-added <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan in recent years was larger than the conventionally measured one; by contrast, U.S. deficits with China, Mexico and Canada are actually smaller in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economist Yingying Xu of the Arlington-based Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation calculates that the United States actually ran 2009 surpluses in manufactured goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> critics inside and outside the Trump administration want information-rich, consistent measures of 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows, they should support innovations such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added - instead of perpetuating the same old political numbers games. Obviously, that's a big if.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1922366501.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump and the Nafta Talks</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No part of Donald Trump's 2016 run for president excited crowds more than his rants against Mexico, his promises to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, to make the neighbors pay for it, and to rewrite or scrap the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rhetorically, President Trump has not stepped back very far from all that. He now says that he will build the wall first and figure how to get the money from Mexico later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understands that he won the presidency partly by making outrageous statements that kept him constantly in the news. But now that the serious business of negotiation on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is beginning, it appears that much of the craziness has been set aside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada have agreed to return to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table, and most of the objectives outlined in the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative's summary, released last week, are aimed not at destroying the 24-year-old pact but modernizing it. In many cases the U.S. is asking to open markets further on a reciprocal basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One objective is freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in agricultural products, which suggests that Canada's protected dairy and poultry markets will be on the table. The document also says the U.S. will aim for greater ease at the borders by \"streamlining\" customs procedures. A specific goal is to raise the value of goods that can enter duty-free in express-mail shipping to $800 from $50. The USTR doesn't make a big point of it, but this mail would presumably include products made in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately some items on the Trump wish list would take the region backward economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hardly surprising that the administration has made it a priority to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada. It has the same wrongheaded obsession globally. But as the Journal explained in a March 10 editorial, \"How to Think About the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Deficit,\" a current-account deficit -- which includes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- doesn't matter because it means there is a capital-account surplus. The dollars Americans spend on foreign-produced goods and services eventually must return to the U.S., usually via investments in U.S. assets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada are even less relevant. In the introduction to its summary, the USTR claims that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits have exploded.\" Yet the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners is less than 13% of the total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> represents 30% of total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Canada and Mexico are the largest export markets for the U.S., and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits are nowhere proportional. It is also worth noting that the U.S. has had a surplus in services with Mexico averaging about $9 billion a year over the past three years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the goods side -- despite all the griping about deficits with Mexico and Canada -- continental free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes U.S. exports more attractive globally. By putting production facilities in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, American auto manufacturers, for example, can turn out cars and trucks that compete on price and quality all over the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reduces the overall U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. All things being equal, the deficit would go down even more if all markets were further opened to U.S. exports. It follows that the ideal U.S. policy for an administration concerned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits would be to work to reduce all barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a world of increasingly interconnected commerce supported by free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, American protectionists have come to rely heavily on antidumping and countervailing duties. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, when exporters are alleged to be selling unfairly -- leaning on government subsidies or pricing a product below market to destroy competitors -- any of the three countries can apply duties as a remedy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, exporters can appeal those duties to an international arbitration panel. The USTR says it wants to eliminate Chapter 19 and instead send disputes to domestic courts. In the U.S. that would be the Court of International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, where the Trump administration and its supporters undoubtedly feel American companies could expect a more favorable outcome than at a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet this would also mean that when Canada and Mexico slap antidumping duties on American products, exporters will have to go to domestic courts in those countries. The result is likely to be rising protectionism in all three markets and sand in the gears of the integrated North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This can only increase divisions, beyond economics, among the three countries at a time when a strong North American alliance is crucial to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere. Mexico has adopted a welcome human-rights policy by taking a strong position against the Venezuelan dictatorship. The U.S. should do what it can to build on this common ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USTR's objectives are largely constructive. But Trump protectionists have planted a few land mines in the otherwise valuable agenda. Americans have to hope that Canada and Mexico will defend the interests that all three partners have in a free and prosperous North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19 To Help American Industry\" -- WSJ Aug. 5, 2017)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "398336933.xml", "text": "<h2>A better U.S. target in Japan--the consumer</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the summit behind him, Kiichi Miyazawa has given Bill Clinton his best going-away present. He's told the president that Japan cannot accept Mickey Kantor's insistence on targets, but he has agreed to the growth of U.S. exports in Japan's market. Not a bad deal for the president, since export targets not only tend to become export ceilings, but would also have strengthened Japan's bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president can now move on to a new agenda, but he and his people are going to have to adopt a two-part strategy. First, they need to put away the bludgeon; all that does is confirm the deep fear of the Japanese that they are being victimized. Second, the U.S. will have to show that when we talk about a \"partnership\" we mean it. But that's going to require that the president's people do their homework on the real state of play in U.S.-Japanese <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Listening to the common wisdom that most of our top exports to Japan are raw materials -- such as maize, raw wood and fish -- won't do it. The reality is the opposite -- and has been for years. Easily 60% of our exports to Japan are manufactured goods, and most of them are of the hightech variety. The adjacent table shows the value of our top five exports through 1991, and in 1992 the top four categories were: $3.9 billion for transportation; $3.6 billion for office and automatic data processing equipment and parts; $2.6 billion for electrical machinery, and $2.4 billion for cork and wood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither will listening to those who insist on talking down the dollar. That policy has been tried since 1985. The result is that while the volume of Japan's oil imports rose by 26% compared with 1985, its bill last year for oil and related products was just 39% of its 1985 cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason: Oil is denominated in dollars. That means we've given Japan a huge discount on its commodity imports, and at the same time nearly doubled the cost to U.S. firms of doing business in Japan. And the high cost of setting up in Japan, rather than tariffs or closed markets, was listed by Americans there as the chief deterrent to greater U.S. investment and exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president has got it right in targeting the Japanese consumer. For the best part of a year, Japan's press has been carrying stories about the rigged bids in the construction business, Liberal Democratic Party ties to gangsters, and what brought it all out -- the gold bars in Shin Kanemaru's house. All this confirmed what ordinary folks had long suspected: They are being ripped off; the prices they pay are crazily high, compared with just about anywhere else. More and more Japanese see this firsthand, since 10 million to 15 million of them travel overseas each year, a third to the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had a good illustration when one of my wife's Japanese friends came to visit. The first place she wanted to see was the local Safeway: to confirm that a 20-pound bag of rice sells here for about $6 to $7, and not the $45 to $50 it brings in Japan. Sure, Japan's bubble has burst, but the U.S. has held its share of the Japanese market. Over the past two years, Japan's imports from the European Community dropped 10%, but from the U.S. hardly at all: Imports in 1990 were $52.4 billion; in 1992, $52.2 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, while the Japanese don't particularly welcome the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they understand the pressures behind it. But how can the U.S. seriously consider extending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Chile, and now to Argentina, when there are more attractive prospects in Asia? Singapore alone -- with just 2.8 million people -- buys more from the U.S. than those two, and South Korea and Taiwan add an additional $15 billion each.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every time the U.S. mentions Chile and Argentina as the next candidates for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- or worse yet inludes Singapore -- Japan begins to think about its trading partners in Asia. Unless Washington wants to promote a world of regional blocs, it needs to consider Korea, Taiwan and, yes, Japan in that format.

{"id": "398519032.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Flexible exchange rates will best serve Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one could argue that the three currencies of North America, two dollars and one peso, make a neat arrangement. Canada's dollar floats. The Mexican peso was propelled by the late 1994 currency crisis from a rate pegged to the U.S. dollar into a float even less predictable than that of Canada. The U.S. dollar? Well, it floats too in North America, since the other two currencies float around it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This situation strikes quite a few commentators as unsatisfactory, whether seen from a strictly national point of view or more broadly as a currency arrangement for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. They would like more fixity as a means of fostering <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and reducing financial uncertainty. But as currency set-ups go, the existing one is realistic in relation to underlying circumstances. With sound domestic financial policies, it is very satisfactory because it helps national economic adjustment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The argument for fixing rates in aid of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires critical examination. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is only what its name says it is -- a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. It isn't even as much as a customs union, where the partners have unified tariffs for items originating outside the zone. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners are free to negotiate separate tariffs with other nations. In particular, the U.S. clearly will continue to tackle some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (and other) issues on its own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still less is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a common market, where the free flow of labor as well as capital across national borders is permitted, and where competition codes are harmonized by supranational legislation -- the Single European Act, for example. This is the context in which countries in Europe now envisage monetary union in 1999 via the Maastricht Treaty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether Europe needs a single currency and therefore a single central bank, with all that this implies, to go with its developing common market continues to be debated by economists. It remains subject to political debate as well, especially in the U.K. However, the point here is that this debate takes place against a scenario of far more economic and political integration than has been dreamed of in North America. Indeed, to point up the contrast, part of the U.S. rationale for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was to provide Mexico with economic opportunities that would curb the migration of labor to the U.S. from Mexico. A common market would imply the reverse, a free flow of labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The difference between <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the EU supports the economic case for exchange rate flexibility in North America. Economic disturbances specific to Mexico or Canada do occur quite often. Exchange rate flexibility is helpful in coping with them. And the case for such flexibility is strengthened when workers themselves cannot adjust by moving freely across North American borders. Furthermore, there are no cross-border budgetary transfers to cushion such disturbances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In any event, what could a monetary union mean in North America? In Europe it means pooling sovereignty among countries of reasonably equal size that would have balanced voting in the proposed common central bank. This is a nonstarter in North America. Canada and Mexico no doubt could use the U.S. dollar as legal tender if they wished. But this would not really be monetary union. Rather it would be official dollarization, with \"official\" only applying to one side.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side, the U.S., would surely look kindly on the use of its currency by close trading partners. It might even return to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners some of the seigniorage proceeds it would obtain through such use. What it could not be expected to do, however, is adapt its monetary policies to circumstances for the continent as a whole, as opposed to those for the U.S., or undertake to support banks outside its jurisdiction, even if those banks were funding themselves in U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So clearly monetary union North American-style has institutional drawbacks. Even to try it, Mexico and Canada would need to have available the U.S. dollars to distribute in place of their own currencies. Canada could just about do that with the reserves it has, but Mexico is short. And to provide a backstop for the national banking system, each country would need either to hold additional U.S. dollars as a liquidity reserve fund or to have a reliable source from which to borrow them at short notice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fixing the exchange rate through a currency board scheme raises similar issues of financing. Argentina showed this in 1995 when it had to use IMF and World Bank funds to stave off a bank run. A more important consideration is that a currency board is a less intense commitment, because the government, rather than the general public, keeps hold of the U.S. dollars that support it. It is therefore less credible in principle than a monetary union. A pegged, or fixed-but-adjustable, rate is far less credible still, as Mexico's recent experience demonstrated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credibility is crucial. From this angle Canada could more readily establish a convincing fixed-rate arrangement than could Mexico, because its financial performance and economic structure are closer to U.S. patterns. But by the same token, for Canada the supposed credibility benefits of fixing would be less. Canadian inflation has been running below the U.S. pace for several years and Canadian interest rates, at least at the shorter end, are already lower than those in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. might believe that fixity would avoid competitive currency depreciations by close trading partners. But in any case, a policy of competitive depreciation is not sustainable, and would not be in the national economic interest of Mexico or Canada either. In particular, such a misguided policy leads to inflation and high interest rates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to make clear that the exchange rate is not an instrument of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is far from saying that it doesn't matter -- for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or for the economy as a whole. And it is of course legitimate for monetary policy in both Canada and Mexico to concern itself with the exchange rate as well as with interest rates. For Canada the present low currency value reflects easier monetary conditions in a context of modest inflation and slow demand. For Mexico matters are more complicated, given the recent blow to confidence, the resulting high interest rates, and high residual inflation. But no one can doubt that demand overall in Mexico is weak, reducing inflationary pressure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada has worked hard to establish a sound currency domestically, in its own economic interest. This effort also provides a solid foundation for a flexible Canadian dollar. The Bank of Mexico -- Mexico's central bank -- has further to go, but it is aiming in the same direction. As it moves further along that path, a floating peso will work better than it does now, because it will be operating against a background of domestic financial confidence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Crow is a senior adviser to the American International Group and was formerly governor of the Bank of Canada.</p>\n"}

In a November tweet, the president let us know in which category he thought Hillary Clinton belonged when he called her \"the worst (and biggest) loser of all time.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is she? If Mrs. Clinton is really the big loser that Mr. Trump claims, why is he now copying her <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On almost every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issue -- China, steel tariffs, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the \"stealing\" of U.S. jobs by other countries via unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices -- Mrs. Clinton long ago laid out the protectionist arguments Mr. Trump now invokes for his own policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with steel. In 2002, when George W. Bush imposed temporary tariffs on imported steel, Mrs. Clinton, then New York's junior senator, endorsed the move. Before Mr. Bush lifted the tariffs the following year, she testified to the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission to make the case that they should be extended. New York, she said, \"has seen mill after mill close as a result of dumped and subsidized imports.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few months later, NBC's Tim Russert noted that her position favoring such tariffs marked a split with her husband. \"I believe you need a steel industry in order to be competitive,\" she replied. Not all that different from Mr. Trump's line last week: \"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steel was not the only area where Sen. Clinton presaged today's Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. She also shared Mr. Trump's skepticism toward multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. While Mrs. Clinton voted for bilateral agreements with countries including Singapore and Morocco, she voted \"nay\" on the one multilateral deal that came up during her stint in the Senate: the Central America Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise with her opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Her husband brokered the deal, and as first lady she had said it was \"proving its worth.\" Yet in 2007, running for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama, she issued what would later become one of Mr. Trump's signature threats to Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I will say we will opt out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America,\" Mrs. Clinton said in Cleveland during a Democratic presidential debate with Mr. Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eight years later, during her next presidential campaign, she would add another reversal by denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she had earlier endorsed as the \"gold standard\" of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, and which Mr. Trump also opposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her second debate with Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton called for the creation of a \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\" In the third presidential debate, she made it personal:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He mentioned China,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state. Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, almost everything Mr. Trump now says on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> echoes what Mrs. Clinton has been saying for years -- or at least since she began running for president. Whether it's complaining about companies that move their factories overseas, \"getting tough\" on China, or calling for a \"time out\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, on this issue it's hard to see much daylight between the two.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This isn't so surprising on Mrs. Clinton's end. Her growing protectionism reflected her party's growing hostility to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and markets, as shown by both Mr. Obama and Bernie Sanders. In the Obama years, the policies that flowed from this approach gave us 2% growth, which was posited as the new normal. Surely this connection between anemic growth and the champions of protectionism ought to give Mr. Trump pause.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, if there is a difference between the two 2016 presidential contenders on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, it is that Mrs. Clinton's protectionist rhetoric has always seemed pegged more to primaries and elections than principle. Mr. Trump, alas, genuinely appears to believe the costs of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war are minimal at worst. Thus the spectacle of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross holding up a Campbell's soup can, suggesting that the tariffs will cost the consumer no more than a extra half-cent here and there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reality of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that many countries do cheat, through government subsidies, tariff and nontariff import barriers, intellectual-property theft and the like. The more difficult reality, however, is that no one has yet found a way to punish cheaters without inflicting more harm on innocent buyers and sellers in one's own economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even for a born salesman, that position would be difficult to sell politically. But it's still better than embracing Hillary's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p>\n"}

Advisers can delay but not dislodge him from his ruts. He is proving impervious to fact, argument or new learning of any kind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since his prejudices are well-known, his decisions should not surprise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What are these predispositions? Allied nations, and especially Japan, play the United States for a chump. Dictators are strong and decisive and therefore to be admired. Immigrants and people of color are suspect. Wealthy people usually know best, while intellectuals are not to be trusted. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits are the ultimate sign of national weakness, and manufacturing is the linchpin of any economy. Anything Barack Obama did should be undone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That canon of gut feelings can explain most of what Trump has done \u2014 and predict what he will do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is most predictable when his biases push in the same direction, as with the Paris climate accord. It was a multilateral agreement, so probably other nations were taking advantage of the United States. Scientists believed it was important. Obama considered it a signal achievement. In Trump's world, the treaty did not have a chance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact that it did not actually bind the United States to take any actions that Trump would not have wanted to take was not in dispute. The argument that pulling out would leave the United States isolated, dealing a major blow to U.S. leadership, was irrefutable. But the facts and arguments ran counter to Trump's preconceived notions, and so were irrelevant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reality-based arguments against withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord were, if anything, even stronger. For a time, the president's senior advisers and his counterparts in Europe, wielding those arguments, managed to postpone the inevitable. After all, Iran was honoring the deal; it was working.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But staying in only made Trump grumpy, because again his preconceptions pushed the opposite way: It was a multilateral treaty; Obama took pride in it. Now the advisers who pushed against the inevitable are mostly gone, and Trump has pulled the United States out of the accord.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His prejudices in various combinations also can explain: A travel ban aimed at Muslims, though data showed no connection between terrorism in the United States and the countries targeted by the ban. A tax bill primarily benefiting businesses and the very rich, though Trump had campaigned on a promise to help the left-behind. A determination to destroy Obamacare, though it was helping many of those same left-behind voters. Abandonment of the mostly Hispanic \"dreamers,\" despite grand promises to help them, while pining for more immigrants from Norway.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people were surprised that Trump pivoted toward talks with North Korea after months of insulting \"little rocket man\" Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, though, in keeping with his predilection for strongmen, he seems to admire Kim \u2014 that \"pretty smart cookie\" \u2014 more than he does South Korea's elected leader. Since Obama largely ignored North Korea, under the label of \"strategic patience,\" striking a deal would fit Trump's inclination to be Obama's opposite in all things. Brushing aside the interests of our Japanese allies, if that's what a deal requires, also would mesh with his predilections.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Admittedly, this framework can't predict every decision. Because Trump refuses to release his tax returns or much information about his still-active enterprises, we can't know whether or how much business interests may motivate his official decisions and override his prejudices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, his gut feelings sometimes work at cross-purposes. He hates</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>because it's a treaty, because he thinks it hurts U.S. manufacturers, because he has always hated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; on the other hand, a lot of wealthy American business and agricultural executives would be hurt if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> blew up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And even if Trump's thinking is not much influenced by evidence or experience, he is fenced in by reality in other ways; the courts and Congress and the states get a say, and like most politicians, he wants to be popular, admired and, presumably, reelected. So, for example, his gut instincts (and maybe his business interests, too) push him to be friends with Vladi\u00admir Putin, but that has yet to happen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, for a man who ran for office saying, \"We have to be unpredictable,\" Trump is proving not so hard to read. Look at whatever he has believed since the 1980s; ignore any evidence that has emerged since; and you can make a fairly educated guess where he will end up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>fredhiatt@washpost.com</p>\n"}

Louisiana's exports of soybeans to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-agreement partners rose 15% in the same period, driven largely by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Latin American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But no state has more at stake than California. It leads the country in agricultural revenue, and its farmers and ranchers are twice as dependent on foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as the country as a whole. Last year, growers in the state earned $21 billion from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- about 44% of their total revenue, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without California, the U.S. would not have exported a single tree nut, table grape, raisin, olive oil drum, garlic clove, artichoke, fig, date, kiwi or dried plum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Golden State last year also exported more than 90% of the wine, processing tomatoes, avocados, carrots, broccoli and celery in the U.S. California's berries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, melons, oranges, lemons, tangerines, mandarins, spinach, lettuce, seasonal vegetables and rice constituted more than half the U.S. exports of those commodities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the countries most responsible for the United States' overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit are California agriculture's best customers -- China and Mexico among them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As recently as Jan. 28, Trump accused China of protecting its exports by depressing the value of its currency, the yuan. He has called the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which links the U.S. with Canada and Mexico, \"the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever\" and threatened to tear it up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The comments drew quick reaction from California officials, even as they scratched their collective heads over what Trump actually intended to do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altering <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"starts to create some market turmoil, which ripples out through the supply chain -- not just the farmer but the transporter, the processor, the ports, longshoremen. It affects a lot of jobs,\" said Josh Rolph, manager of federal policy for the California Farm Bureau Federation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship is very important. We would be concerned to see that relationship negatively affected,\" said Ken Barbic, senior director of federal government affairs for Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico supplied the U.S. with more than $5 billion in fresh vegetables, $1.4 billion in processed fruits and vegetables, $4.5 billion in fruit and $2.8 billion in beer and wine last year, according to the USDA. All could be targets of a tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California's top exports to Mexico -- dairy, forestry products, prepared foods and fresh fruit -- could find themselves in the political crosshairs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, taxes could be imposed on Canada's imports of wood products, processed foods and fish, and the country potentially could retaliate against the fruits and vegetables, wine and beer, nuts and processed foods that California exports north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even a small alteration in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- a strike, slowdown or other protest in Mexico, for example -- could hit consumers, who expect fruits and vegetables in the produce aisles year-round, regardless of growing seasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the avocado: Last year, prices skyrocketed when Mexico could not harvest them during a few weeks when there was a gap in U.S. supply, itself beset by drought. Restaurants and sandwich shops began charging extra, guacamole disappeared from cafe plates and consumers griped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar weather problem in Mexico lately has driven up the price of asparagus, a crop that has shifted to Mexico since the passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Unable to compete, California growers have cut production of the crop by 70% since the mid-1990s, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the U.S.-Mexico relationship got rocky, it cost U.S. growers close to $1 billion in lost sales from 2009 to 2011, said USDA economist Steven Zahniser. That's when Mexico launched retaliatory tariffs against dozens of U.S. agricultural products, over U.S. reluctance to comply with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> provisions to allow Mexican trucks into the States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Resolving a tiff in one economic sector by using food as a pawn is not an unusual tactic. Food frequently bears a steeper penalty in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars because it carries a lot of political clout. It doesn't last as long as politicians can argue, for one. And few people riot over the price of a smartphone, laptop or car, but they've been known to overthrow governments over an increase in the price of food or shortages of staples.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Russia continues to ban food imports from the European Union, after those countries sanctioned Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. In 2015, Canada and Mexico were set to retaliate against U.S. wine, fruits, meat, cheese and dozens of other items over a dispute involving meat labeling.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'll tell you where I'm most worried about: It's not between-country negotiations; it's when we get a mercantilist, deal-by-deal kind of mentality,\" said Daniel Sumner, a resource economist who heads UC Davis' Agricultural Issues Center. \"You don't want your president telling businesses how to run their business.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, though, cajoling businesses appears to be Trump's approach. Last month, he threatened to tax General Motors over its manufacture of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback in Mexico. GM countered that all of the Cruze sedans are built in Ohio, although several thousand Cruze hatchbacks from Mexican factories are sold here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also threatened a 35% tax on Ford vehicles if more of them were made in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has yet to mention taxing avocados.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>geoffrey.mohan@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter: @LATgeoffmohan</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: CALIFORNIA leads the U.S. in agricultural revenue; its farmers and ranchers rely heavily on foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

{"id": "398955105.xml", "text": "<h2>Business World: Tree Growin' Man</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chuck Leavell considers it \"pitiful\" that only 0.06% of farm spending is devoted to subsidizing private forestry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One responsibility of a columnist is to listen to rock'n'rollers who want to share their views on farm policy. Mr. Leavell has been playing piano for the Rolling Stones for 24 years. In his other life, he operates a private forestry plantation near Macon, Ga., and by a magic chemistry of his twin professions, has become a top spokesman and lobbyist for the nation's thousands of private forest owners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He doesn't kid himself. Mr. Leavell knows that journalists and the countless audiences he addresses sit still for the tree lecture partly because he rubs shoulders with Mick and Keith. Or, if they are music fans of a certain antiquity, because of his piano work on a true national heirloom, the Allman Brothers instrumental \"Jessica.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He joined the band in 1972, just 20 years old, when the group was putting itself back together after Duane Allman's fatal motorcycle crash. \"I was thinking about how I'd establish my instrument in the band,\" recalls Mr. Leavell. That's when the band's surviving guitarist, Dickey Betts, came through the studio door with a new tune penned while listening to Django Reinhardt records with his baby daughter, Jessica.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But enough of the history of classic rock, volume one. Mr. Leavell wants to talk trees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peel away the glamour and higher-risk activities than even most baby boomers managed in their youth, and Mr. Leavell turns out to have much in common with the rest of the tribe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With hard work and luck, he secured his little piece of heaven. But paradise comes with headaches. At 53, he finds himself worrying about taxes, regulation, foreign competition and how to pass to their children what he and his wife, Rose Lane Leavell, have built.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1981, the couple inherited 1,200 rural acres from Rose Lane's grandmother. The first challenge was how to pay the estate taxes. With much gnashing of teeth, they sold a parcel of land that had been in her family for 100 years for a down payment to the IRS, spending the next 15 years paying off the balance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Challenge two was how to make the land productive without Mr. Leavell having to give up touring to tend crops or cattle. Answer: Plant trees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As time went on, the couple enlarged the property by purchasing more land. They added nature trails for school kids. They added a hunting lodge, with Mr. Leavell himself, when he's in town, leading paying clients in pursuit of quail. He's written three books, including a new children's book, \"The Tree Farmer.\" But, for the time being, his Rolling Stones income must still help meet the plantation's expenses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When buttonholing the opinion vanguard, two of Mr. Leavell's hobby horses are taxes and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. As development drives up land values and property taxes, timber has become increasingly uneconomic. The problem is compounded by a flood of cheap lumber culled from Canada's endless public forests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Leavell is steeped in both sides of this long and nasty <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dispute because, before each tour, the Stones spend several weeks rehearsing in Toronto. \"They cry <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. We say level playing field.\" There's only one solution, he says: \"I'm not a big fan of subsidies, but when you're facing Canada, which does nothing but subsidize its timber, you gotta play the game.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He offers plenty of good environmental reasons why private forest owners should be coddled as a matter of public policy. Trees scrub carbon dioxide from the air, help purify the water, provide habitat for birds and critters, etc.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here Mr. Leavell, a man of gentle and courtly demeanor, is engaged in what inevitably must be characterized as special pleading. I explain to him that the Journal editorial page has long been in favor of eliminating farm subsidies, not spreading them to new classes of landowners. And while trees yield public benefits, they also yield Mr. Leavell a great deal of private satisfaction, for which some taxpayers might feel perfectly comfortable letting him pick up the whole tab.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But let's not be too dogmatic. Lobbying is a great and necessary privilege in a free society. As Mr. Leavell has been known to tell audiences, our elected leaders work for us, we don't work for them, and it's entirely proper for citizens to convey their needs and interests to their elected representatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor does he seem primarily concerned with his own interests. After all, he's got the musical income to subsidize his rural activities. But he does seem to take quite seriously his role as spokesman for thousands of landowners who, beset by sprawl and rising taxes, are forced to sell family forest land to developers that they'd rather keep as woody habitat for wildlife.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>White-bearded, trim and dapper, Mr. Leavell has a second job for the Stones as the band's unofficial musical director, coaching the gang through a repertoire that changes each night. A high school dropout from deepest Alabama, was he surprised to discover he had a knack for management? He nods his head: \"Especially public speaking. To stand up and give my views in public -- that's something I never would have considered. Now I love it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, his bemused bandmates have become accepting of the inevitability of a certain amount of tree talk on tour. Put it down to transatlantic cultural exchange: With his missionary enthusiasm and passion for self-improvement, Mr. Leavell exhibits what many would call the best features of the American character.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Tree Farmers Face Loss Of Crops From Katrina\" -- WSJ Feb. 9, 2006)</p>\n"}
{"id": "2160683538.xml", "text": "<h2>Analysis -- Trump's Trade Impact: A World Divided in Two</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Donald Trump entered the White House on a platform of defiant nationalism nearly two years ago, many feared he would dismantle the global trading system the U.S. and its allies had built over 70 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He hasn't. Instead, he is presiding over its realignment into two distinct systems. One, between the U.S. and its traditional, democratic trading partners, looks a lot like the system that has prevailed since the 1980s: free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with a smattering of quotas and tariffs like those Ronald Reagan once deployed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reflects an emerging rivalry between the U.S. and China carrying echoes of the Cold War. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, investment and technology, the U.S. is moving to undo some of the integration that followed China's accession to the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 2001.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are two big questions hanging over this realignment. The first is deciding how far the U.S. is prepared to decouple from China. The U.S. has given China until March 1 to avoid higher tariffs by addressing complaints it discriminates against foreign companies and steals their technology. Mr. Trump is counting on a deal that avoids a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war. But many in his administration and Congress don't trust China to make the necessary concessions and would likely advocate a sharper break.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second question is whether the U.S. can persuade allies to join a united front to contain China. Other countries don't relish the choice. Their economic ties to China are far greater than they ever were to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor are the ideological choices as clear cut. China isn't waging an ideological struggle against the West as the Soviets did, and Mr. Trump, while enacting policies reminiscent of President Reagan, lacks his commitment to alliances and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two years ago, it was easy to predict a grimmer fate for the global trading system. Mr. Trump campaigned as a protectionist willing to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and raise tariffs to shrink the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit and bring back factory jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his first week he withdrew from the unratified 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. He prepared to pull out of the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (Korus) and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Earlier this year he imposed steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, using a little-used national security law, and threatened the same for autos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, Korus and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have been replaced by updated pacts (one not yet ratified) that look much like the originals. South Korea accepted quotas on steel. Mexico and Canada agreed to higher wages, North American content rules and auto quotas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These represent a step back from free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> toward managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but they will have little practical effect. The limits on how many cars Mexico and Canada can ship duty-free to the U.S. for example, exceed current shipments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit that incenses Mr. Trump has grown during his presidency as the U.S. sucks in imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Douglas Irwin, an economist and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> historian at Dartmouth College, calls these results the \"status quo with Trumpian tweaks: a little more managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sprinkled about for favored industries. It's not good, but it's not the destruction of the system.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's actions so far affect only 12% of U.S. imports, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In 1984, 21% of imports were covered by similar restraints, many imposed by Mr. Reagan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is testament to something Mr. Irwin has identified in two centuries of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy: Both protectionism and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> breed powerful constituencies invested in the status quo. Mr. Trump's protectionist instincts go only so far when Congress, business and the national security establishment don't share them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the status quo with China is crumbling. Businesses have grown disillusioned with China's restrictions on their activities, forced technology transfer and intellectual-property theft. Legislators in both parties are alarmed at increased military assertiveness and domestic repression under President Xi Jinping.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) personifies these broader forces reshaping the U.S. approach to the world. Mr. Sullivan has followed the rise of China for decades -- as a Marine sent to the Taiwan Strait in 1996; as an official in George W. Bush's National Security Council and State Department; and as Alaska's commissioner of natural resources.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Mr. Xi visited the U.S. in 2015, Mr. Sullivan urged his colleagues to pay more attention to China's rise. He quoted the political scientist Graham Allison: \"War between the U.S. and China is more likely than recognized at the moment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last spring, Mr. Sullivan went to China and met officials including Vice President Wang Qishan. They seemed to think tensions with the U.S. will fade after Mr. Trump, Mr. Sullivan recalled. \"I just said, 'You are completely misreading this.'\" The mistrust, he told them, is bipartisan, and will outlast Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While delivering one message to China, Mr. Sullivan gave a different one to the administration and its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators: Don't alienate allies needed to take on China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Modernize the agreements but stay within the agreements,\" he says he counseled them. \"Then we have to turn to the really big geostrategic challenge facing our country and that's China.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His was one voice among many urging Mr. Trump to single out China for pressure. Presidents Obama and George W. Bush sought to change China's behavior through dialogue and engagement. Last year, in its National Security Strategy, the Trump administration declared engagement a failure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration regards economic policy and national security as inseparable when it comes to Beijing, because China's acquisition of Western technology both strengthens China militarily and weakens the U.S. economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't like it when our allies steal our ideas either, but it's a much less dangerous situation,\" said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute whose views align with the administration's more hawkish officials. \"We're not worried about the war-fighting capability of Japan and Korea because they're our friends.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration has yet to publicly explain its goals. In 1946, at the start of the Cold War, diplomat George Kennan made the case for containing the Soviet Union in his famous \"long telegram.\" The Trump administration hasn't done anything comparable for China. One reason might be that administration officials are divided. Mr. Trump appears torn between wanting to halt China's rise at any cost and hoping for \"a big and very comprehensive deal\" that lifts the cloud of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute scholar close to the Trump team who has long warned of China's strategic threat, sees three plausible scenarios. At one extreme is a new cold war with drastically curtailed economic ties. At the other, the U.S. and China resolve their tensions, continue to integrate and run the world together.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between those extremes, Mr. Pillsbury sees a more likely and desirable middle path -- a transactional U.S.-China relationship of the sort that prevailed during the 1980s in which the two decide, case by case, when to do business and when to decouple.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though administration officials haven't publicly embraced such a policy, their actions conform to it, most clearly in their intensified efforts to find, publicize and punish wrongdoing by Chinese companies and state actors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S.'s request to Canada to extradite an executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., like an earlier case against smart-phone maker ZTE</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corp., is for allegedly violating Iran sanctions. The cases also have the effect of clipping the wings of Chinese national champions. Meanwhile, Congress this year expanded the administration's authority to block foreign investments in the U.S., especially in technology, and stop exports that transfer U.S. technology abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the fate of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports hinges on current negotiations, some companies, from Lennox International Inc., which makes heating and cooling systems, to shoe manufacturer Steve Madden Ltd., said they are shifting supply chains out of China, further decoupling the two economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many companies are . . . pursuing a 'China plus one' strategy, in which current China production remains largely in place but the marginal dollar of new investment goes into countries with lower labor costs,\" Dan Wang, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, recently wrote to clients.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is stepping up efforts to draw its other trading partners into a united front to take on China. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer and his EU and Japan counterparts have launched an effort at the WTO to crack down on China's domestic subsidies and its technology-transfer requirements. The Group of 20 nations agreed at their recent summit to reform the WTO to address complaints it doesn't adequately police China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. and domestic concerns have prompted Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Britain and Canada to restrict or consider restricting Huawei equipment in their telecom infrastructure, in particular for the next 5G mobile phone standard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is also seeking to wall China off from future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. It insisted the pact replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> include a clause letting the U.S. quit if either Canada or Mexico signs a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with a \"non-market economy,\" i.e., China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This realignment is fraught with risks -- for the U.S., China and the broader global economy -- beyond any short-term hit to growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first goes to the heart of Mr. Trump's goal. If his aim is to hold back China's advance, economists predict he will fail. China's innovative capacity has expanded dramatically. China now accounts for 18.6% of articles in international scientific journals, according to one study, and nearly a quarter of global venture-capital investment, according to another.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, some China experts fear that the U.S., by adopting a more adversarial approach, weakens China's reformers and strengthens its nationalist factions, making conflict more likely. They predict China will intensify its pursuit of technological self-sufficiency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tom Linebarger, chief executive of engine maker Cummins Inc., represents the Business Roundtable, which supports a crackdown on China's discriminatory <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices but not a decoupling of the economies. \"The only thing worse than an unlevel playing field is no playing field at all,\" Mr. Linebarger said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Persuading other countries to hold China at arm's length will be harder than containing the Soviet Union. China accounts for 11% of world exports, whereas the Soviet Union in the 1980s accounted for less than 3%, not counting to Eastern Europe. China is 22% of Japanese imports and exports; the Soviet Union was less than 1%. Many of China's close neighbors depend far more, economically, on China than on the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The assumption behind some of the cold war, containment, decoupling rhetoric you hear rests on a fallacy -- that such a strategy is deliverable in the 21st century given the integrated nature of the global economy and the role of China,\" said Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who now heads the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials note that China's aid, such as its Belt and Road infrastructure program, often saddles recipients with debt. Yet the U.S. offers no alternative, said Mr. Rudd.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies undermine the united front he wants against China. He hasn't sworn off protectionism against U.S. allies, promising to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> even if its replacement isn't ratified by Congress. His steel and aluminum tariffs, most of which remain in place, outraged such allies as Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials play down such frictions as easily worked out. Abroad, they are seen as more serious. Canadian ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said he told U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators that if Mr. Trump carried through on his threatened 25% tariff on Canadian autos, it would fundamentally change bilateral relations for the worse for years to come. In a letter accompanying <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s replacement, the U.S. agreed not to levy the tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even among advocates of decoupling with China, a recurrent worry is that the current administration isn't up to the task. Said the American Enterprise Institute's Mr. Scissors: \"We can blow this. And if we blow it, we'll get a world economy that's poorer than it should be, with all the distortions and inconsistencies that come from unpredictable U.S. policy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "1871409028.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's attempt to massage economic data isn't new. But there's a better way.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing you need to know about the latest controversy involving President Trump's alleged attempt to manipulate economic data for political purposes is that Bernie Sanders probably would have done the same thing, and quite possibly Hillary Clinton, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mainstream economists recoiled at a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that said Trump appointees at the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative want official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances between the United States and various countries rejiggered to make bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits seem larger -- and, by implication, Trump's protectionist policies more necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his blog, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and author of a leading economics textbook, responded simply: \"You've got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Per long-standing international economic practice, the headline figure for the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and any other nation has been expressed as the difference between two numbers: the value of U.S. imports from that trading partner and the value of U.S. exports to it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, however, left-wing critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have said that this data point distorts the deals' actual impact. In 2014, 14 Democratic members of the House -- including current party-chair candidate and 2016 Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) -- wrote to President Barack Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative demanding that he adopt the same math that Trump is reportedly contemplating. One of the first to defend Trump this week was Lori Wallach, a left-wing anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> activist at Public Citizen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do they have a point? Well, kinda sorta. The headline numbers lump together made-in-the-USA exports with goods produced in third countries that enter the United States on their way elsewhere. Example: Samsung TVs from South Korea land at Long Beach, Calif., and get trucked to Tijuana, perhaps after a little repackaging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since these \"re-exports\" by definition aren't made by American workers, critics argue that it's more accurate, in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s impact on U.S. jobs, to focus on the difference between purely made-in-the-USA exports and imports that remain in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would dramatically alter reported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with Mexico and Canada, to which nearly half of all U.S. re-exports go -- since those nations border us and don't have tariffs, thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 2016 U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico would have been not $63.1 billion but $115.4 billion, the Journal noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that, no matter how you count it, a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit (or surplus) per se is neither good nor bad -- unfashionable though it may be to restate that basic tenet of economic theory amid the current left-right protectionist convergence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> undoubtedly displaced American workers in certain sectors, just as it also created new job opportunities elsewhere -- including in the vast logistical chain through which re-exports flow. And it enabled U.S. consumers to access various desirable goods at lower prices than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits are diffuse and the job losses concentrated and acutely felt, of course -- a fact of politics, not economics, that Trump's data massage seems designed to exploit. (No final decision has been made, the administration told the Journal.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no legitimate full-disclosure issue here, since the data Trump and his progressive bedfellows prefer is already available from the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission. What they want is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative's imprimatur on their ideology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the rigid distinction between U.S.-made goods -- which \"create jobs\" -- and all others is breaking down due to global supply chains. Economist Lee Ohanian of UCLA has reported that the production process for certain goods takes them back and forth over the U.S.-Mexico border 14 times before they're ready for market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many imports from China are assembled from inputs made in other countries. Example: the iPhone, whose components come from Japan, Korea, Germany and, indeed, the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ideally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> figures would take the iPhone apart, so to speak, awarding each country in the chain credit for the value its workers added. Analysts at the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are working on just such a \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added\" concept.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their results are tentative, and not fully up to date, but still suggestive: The United States' value-added <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan in recent years was larger than the conventionally measured one; by contrast, U.S. deficits with China, Mexico and Canada are actually smaller in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economist Yingying Xu of the Arlington-based Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation calculates that the United States actually ran 2009 surpluses in manufactured goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, in value-added terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> critics inside and outside the Trump administration want information-rich, consistent measures of 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows, they should support innovations such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-in-value-added -- instead of perpetuating the same old political numbers games. Obviously, that's a big if.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p>\n"}

Roosevelt proclaimed in his first inaugural address that there might have to be a \"temporary departure\" from \"the normal balance of executive and legislative authority\" so that he could wield in domestic policy \"broad executive power\" as great as would be given to him were America \"invaded by a foreign foe.\" Such was the allure of unfettered executive power, the Studebaker automobile company of South Bend, Ind., marketed a model called the Dictator.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Constitution vests in Congress the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\" For decades, however, Congress has granted vast <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> discretion to presidents, for reasons of sloth (setting policy is work), prudence (taking responsibility is risky) and ideology (executive discretion is modern; the separation of powers is an anachronistic impediment to energetic government). Today, however, there is growing legislative resistance to some broad powers that presidents possess because legislators improvidently \u2014 and, arguably, unconstitutionally \u2014 delegated them to presidents, particularly regarding international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Those powers include the presidential imposition of taxes \u2014 which tariffs are \u2014 paid by Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sens.

Imagine the generals and admirals today trying to explain the threat posed by imported automobiles and auto parts, or by steel and aluminum imported from nations (six of the top 10 sources of imported steel) that have mutual-defense agreements with the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1903, Winston Churchill, then 28, warned (this is from Andrew Roberts's magnificent new biography) that by embracing protectionism, the Conservative Party would \"cause the lobbies to be crowded with the touts of protected industries.\" The Trump administration's protectionism has turned the Commerce Department \u2014 it is now an impediment to the activity that its name denotes \u2014 into a bazaar for such touts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) raises an issue that implicates constitutional issues that are even more fundamental than those addressed by the Portman-Jones-Ernst measure. President Trump might try to force congressional ratification of his United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) replacement of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement by terminating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This would confront Congress with an unpalatable choice: Embrace the USMCA or live without an agreement and with economic chaos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toomey correctly argues that Congress cannot delegate the power to repeal statutes.

Jackson said that presidential powers \"fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress,\" and presidential power is at its \"lowest ebb\" when the president acts against the \"express or implied will of Congress.\" That will is expressed, not merely implied, in congressional-executive agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the Studebaker company expired in 1966, a Dictator model is displayed in South Bend's Studebaker Museum.

{"id": "421498571.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD; MEXICO; Economic Growth Meets Weak Local Government</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Natural disasters have a way of exposing the weaknesses of Mexico's political system. The torrential rains and floods that hit central and Gulf Coast Mexico this month show how antiquated, inefficient and dangerous the system of governance is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tropical storm that swept across the states of Puebla, Hidalgo, Veracruz and Tabasco earlier this month was devastating enough. But what made the flooding that followed Mexico's \"worst disaster in a decade, in terms of lives lost\" (in President Ernesto Zedillo's words) can be illustrated by events in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As much rain fell on this bustling mountain in three days this month as usually falls all year. But Teziutlan seemed wealthy enough to protect itself. The city has become an enormous sewing center and one of Mexico's great success stories since the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement went into effect. American Eagle jeans and Oscar de la Renta shirts are among the lines produced here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it turned out, flooding created the worst tragedy in the city's history: close to 200 people killed in landslides, 500 homes destroyed, another 1,200 damaged, many more unlivable, thousands of people left homeless. A landslide at the La Aurora neighborhood, which is slapped onto the side of a hill, took dozens of homes and what investigators believe will eventually be more than 150 people with it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People began building in the area about 15 years ago. But the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> sewing boom sent a hodgepodge of houses scurrying up the hillside. It was all unplanned, without proper subdivision. Teziutlan officials were helpless to manage the growth or insist on proper construction. Nor did they have a budget to install storm drains, repair cracked water pipes or pave the streets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Teziutlan disaster is what happens when rapid economic growth meets a political system chiefly designed to manage poverty. Mexican local government, where this growth occurs, is unprepared to control, direct or benefit from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican cities' budgets, which are determined by Mexico City, are so minuscule that they cannot build and maintain infrastructure or hire capable civil servants. They have only slight taxing power. Moreover, mayors and city councils are barred from reelection: Every three years, they leave, and much of the city staff leaves with them. A newly elected slate must learn to govern from scratch. Mexican city government is thus characterized by constant improvisation and a lack of long-term planning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one reason why economic growth in Mexico translates so slowly into economic development and higher standards of living. \"Globalization grabs us. It develops us very quickly,\" says Jose Luis Olvera, Teziutlan's director of public works. \"But as a government, we haven't been able to take the measures necessary to keep up. This is a national problem. Many places in the country are like this.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan has had a sewing industry since the 1920s. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> lowered tariffs on clothing among its three participating countries-- Mexico, Canada and the United States--Teziutlan boomed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least 100 plants have sprung up since 1994, when the treaty took effect. No one's even sure how many plants there are, since small maquiladoras were set up in houses or shops and the city doesn't have the staff to monitor them. The garment-industry work force, meanwhile, has swelled to about 35,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The maquiladoras gave rural folk from impoverished surrounding villages steady work, health benefits and the ability to educate their children. But the only places where the workers could live were on hillsides or in ravines. The choice was brutish: Starve at home or come to work in Teziutlan and live on the side of a hill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan's economy generates money that could provide for the basic infrastructure the city lacks. The money just doesn't stay in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Mexican system of government, all tax receipts go to the central government in Mexico City, which redistributes them to the states and cities. Cities get only 5% of revenues. The taxes that Teziutlan's maquiladoras pay subsidize the central government rather than help finance the local infrastructure needs that their businesses and employees create.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should be a huge boon to a local economy instead becomes a cause for disaster. Local government cannot take full advantage of the investment coming into Mexico. That, in turn, prevents Mexico from enjoying the full benefits of one of its greatest comparative advantages: Its neighbor is the wealthiest consumer market in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, Teziutlan will have difficulty leveraging its sewing industry into more skilled and remunerative manufacturing. It has no civil service to envision or plan for such a development. It has no money for job-training programs. It can't offer incentives to other types of manufacturing to relocate here. Its maquiladora owners have formed a committee to demand more infrastructure investment, but the city has nothing to respond with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When wages hit a ceiling that garment makers can't afford, or when the city becomes too congested, the sewing plants, which are notoriously easy to set up and to abandon, will likely go elsewhere. Sewing will no longer be Teziutlan's stepping stone to something better.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Virtually every growing Mexican city is ringed with shantytowns that lack electricity, paved streets, drinking water and storm-drain systems. These cities generate money, but they don't get to spend it. Their ad hoc administrations can't prevent shantytowns and unplanned neighborhoods like La Aurora, but neither can they provide for them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are as anemic as Teziutlan. The only difference is that these other cities haven't had a natural disaster come their way--yet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sam Quinones, an Alicia Patterson fellow for 1998, is working on a book about Mexico</p>\n"}
{"id": "1888402285.xml", "text": "<h2>Mr. Trump's 10-Second Convictions</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Donald Trump has made so many promises, from wiping out the national debt -- a pledge dismissed last week by his own budget director as \"hyperbole\" -- to changing the name of the Denali peak back to Mount McKinley, that it can be hard to keep track of how many he's breaking. So here's a partial list of his reversals and revisions, large and small, to date:SYRIA In 2013, when Barack Obama sought congressional approval for military action in response to President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria, Mr. Trump rejected any intervention, in a storm of tweets. On April 6, without consulting Congress, the administration attacked Syria, with the surreal explanation that Mr. Obama's \"weakness and irresolution\" made it necessary.RUSSIA Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Russia, complicit for years in Mr. Assad's brutality; he has even encouraged its meddling in the affairs of other nations, like the United States. On April 5, under heavy fire for his campaign's ties with Russia, he declared relations with Russia worse than ever, \"because they're aligned\" with Syria. In another reversal, he denies knowing Vladimir Putin.NATO For months, Mr. Trump condemned NATO as \"obsolete,\" falsely claiming that it doesn't fight terrorism. Last week, after meeting with NATO's secretary general, Mr. Trump declared, \"It's no longer obsolete ... they made a change and now they do fight terrorism.\" NATO didn't change; Mr. Trump's mind did.HEALTH CARE Mr. Trump vowed not to cut Medicare or Medicaid, then embraced a Republican Obamacare replacement that would drastically raise costs for older Americans. It failed. Now he says he'll force Democrats to negotiate by cutting Obamacare's health insurance subsidies for seven million poor people.TAX REFORM After his health care overhaul failed, Mr. Trump said he'd pivot to tax reform. Last week he roiled markets by saying he might pivot back to health care (see above).TRAVEL Criticizing Mr. Obama's summer vacation, Mr. Trump said that as president he \"would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done.\" Thanks to his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, he's on target to ring up more bills for travel in his first year than Mr. Obama did in eight years. (And, yes, he used to accuse the Obamas of extravagantly spending taxpayer money.)PRESCRIPTION DRUGS In December, the newly elected president pledged to use his fabled deal-making powers to \"bring down drug prices.\" After he met with drug company chiefs in the White House in January, that promise evaporated.TAX LOOPHOLES Mr. Trump said last year that he would close \"special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\" He then picked Stephen Schwarzman, a financier who has compared closing those loopholes to Hitler's invasion of Poland, to lead a White House \"strategic and policy forum.\"CHINA Mr. Trump targeted China throughout the campaign, saying that on his first day he'd label it a currency manipulator and act to reverse its entry into the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization. Last week, after his first meeting with the Chinese president, he declared that China is no longer a currency manipulator, and said little about its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mr. Trump told workers in Michigan that on Day 1, \"A Trump administration will renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies. 100 percent.\" He's failed to take any action.THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed that as president he would give up his business. Instead, he passed day-to-day operations to his oldest sons, while he continues to receive regular updates; is able to withdraw profits; and travels to promote his properties, at taxpayer expense, through high-profile visits.THE FED Last year, Mr. Trump blasted the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates low for political purposes. Last week, he told The Wall Street Journal that he respects Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, adding, \"I do like a low-interest-rate policy.\"INCOME TAXES Mr. Trump first said he'd release his taxes after an audit, and then, after he was president. Two days after his inauguration, he reneged.EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS As a candidate, Mr. Trump made up his own numbers, putting unemployment rates as high as 42 percent, calling the government's statistics \"phony.\" As president he touts the official numbers, when they're good.EXPORT-IMPORT BANK In 2015, Mr. Trump slammed the export financing agency as \"featherbedding\" for politicians and big corporations. Last week, he called the Ex-Im Bank \"a very good thing,\" saying that \"lots of small companies are really helped.\"In some instances, President Trump has adopted, for the moment, more sensible positions than the sweeping, outlandish ones he took during the campaign. Some commentators point to the comforting possibility that his reversals mean that Mr. Trump is growing in office, adapting postures born of ignorance or political calculus as he meets the realities of governing.But then you'd have to overlook the nasty positions he's stuck to, as he caters to the oligarchs who surround him, builds his personal fortune and stirs the darker passions of his base. Why else would he break his promise to release his taxes or relinquish control of his business? Mr. Trump now surrounds himself with the bankers he once lambasted; he's lagged behind on promises of infrastructure jobs, manufacturing revival and health care, while opening up bidding on the wall. He's decried Syria's gas attack on \"beautiful babies\" but continues to bar Syria's children from America.To attribute the president's pirouettes to personal growth would also require ignoring what's actually staring us in the face -- that there is no foundation to this presidency. With his all-important ratings tanking, the reality-TV maestro is rewriting the script, enthusiastically swapping out any position in pursuit of a \"deal.\" He is revealing himself to be a tactical, transactional president, with no guiding convictions or principles beyond \"winning.\" Not winning for everyone, as he so famously promised. Winning for Mr. Trump.Democrats or House Freedom Caucus members, NATO members or Middle East dictators, potential allies or adversaries -- all must be deeply unsettled by the one clear pattern emerging here, a pattern that is consistent with Mr. Trump's treatment of others in private life, from his stiffing of his creditors to his swindling of students at Trump University: betrayal.And where does that leave the working-class voters who pinned their hopes on this man? They can live with what Mr. Trump calls successes, and hope that his interests align enough with theirs to achieve some peripheral benefit. Or they can press their legislators, and demand from Mr. Trump himself, that he stop spinning and start delivering.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARDDrawing (Drawing by Nicolas Ortega)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SYRIA In 2013, when Barack Obama sought congressional approval for military action in response to President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria, Mr. Trump rejected any intervention, in a storm of tweets.

{"id": "2254996726.xml", "text": "<h2>The lesson of Ross Perot: However flawed the messenger \u2014 listen</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm all ears!\" With that self-deprecating one-liner in a debate against President George H.W. Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, H. Ross Perot defined his 1992 presidential bid.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The line was candy for TV producers seeking a soundbite from the debate, and it not only winningly mocked Perot's rather large ears but also served as a signal to the country that he was listening to folks the elites had ignored.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot, who died Tuesday at age 89, garnered nearly  1 out of 5 votes in that election, despite running against an incumbent president who'd successfully ousted Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and an Arkansas governor who proved to be the one of the most gifted political talents of his time. Why did an eccentric Texas billionaire capture the largest share of the vote of any third-party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure, Perot was quirky, quotable and charismatic. But he was also substantive. His infomercials and his charts were about ideas, not self-aggrandizement. He had a clear, focused message: Stop the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and balance the budget. He had other issues, including cleaning up corruption in Washington, supporting abortion rights and opposing Bush's Gulf War. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the deficit were the driving issues of Perot's candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After winning the White House, my boss , Clinton, studied the results. Whereas others dismissed Perot as a kook and a flake, Clinton focused not on the man but on the movement. Nineteen million Americans were trying to tell our nation something. Clinton decided he'd better be all ears, too, so he adjusted. He confronted Perot where he felt he had to: on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But he also took Perot seriously \u2014 so seriously that the White House sent Vice President Al Gore to debate Perot on CNN in November 1993. Gore crushed Perot, and yet the debate itself showed respect to the millions of people who wanted their voices heard. Clinton added side agreements to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that were designed to protect environmental and labor rights. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed because Clinton adapted, and he adapted because he respected Perot's voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the deficit, Clinton did more than adapt; he refocused. In the 1992 campaign, he pledged to cut the deficit by half in four years. At the time, the promise seemed audacious. But Perot listened to folks who saw the deficit as a Rorschach of everything that was wrong with Washington: buck-passing, blame-assigning and can-kicking. Perot called the deficit \"a crazy aunt you keep down in the basement. All the neighbors know she's there, but nobody talks about her.\" Clinton loved that formulation, which I often repeated while doing an impression of Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The combination of Perot's remarkable performance in the election and the urgent advice of his economic team persuaded Clinton to make deficit reduction a central pillar of his economic plan; indeed, he left his successor a federal budget surplus of $86.4 billion. I am not sure we would have ever balanced the budget without the pressure Perot and his voters brought to the issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot could have been dismissed because he got no electoral votes (yet another illustration of how the electoral college stands in opposition to the will of the people). And his eccentricities distracted many observers. For crying out loud, the guy accused Bush of having a secret plan to disrupt his daughter's wedding. Clinton decided that he would ignore the zaniness and instead turn to winning over Perot's voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a lesson here for both parties. It is tempting for Democrats to dismiss supporters of President Trump as racists, misogynists or ignoramuses. And it is nearly irresistible to obsess on Trump's serial scandals and his woeful lack of character. At the same time, too many Republicans show raw contempt for the resurgent left: They personally attack Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), or mock those who are calling for a radical restructuring of an economic system they see as rigged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is not the lesson of Ross Perot. However flawed the messenger, however misguided the policy proposal, when millions of people are crying out \u2014 in pain, in frustration, in anger \u2014 the best response of a leader is to listen. The same is true in real life. As I approach my 30th wedding anniversary, I delight in telling our kids that the secret to a long relationship is three little words. Not \"I love you,\" but \"I hear you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If politicians today want to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle quality of Perot's quixotic, chaotic, hypnotic campaign, the first thing they should do is grow a pair of Perot-sized ears.</p>\n"}

It reduced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, and today the United States exports nearly four times more to our two neighbors than to Japan and China and 40% more than to the 15-nation European Union.

The peso crisis of 1995, which reduced Mexico's economy by 6% and left the United States disenchanted with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, occurred because we had no institutional capacity to anticipate problems or coordinate policy. Duplicating bureaucracies and weak infrastructure at both borders have raised the cost of doing business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All three leaders, who won elections in 2000, should begin by agreeing on principles to guide the relationship and the goals North America should pursue. Without such an understanding, the partnership implicit in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s spirit will continue to be sabotaged by the U.S. penchant for unilateralism and the Canadian and Mexican preference for bilateralism. The United States angers its neighbors when it acts on issues like drug trafficking without consulting them, and our neighbors miss an important opportunity when each of them deals with Washington without the other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three North American countries should learn from the Continent's experiment on integration. The European Union's mistake was to over-bureaucratize. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s was the opposite--it has no serious institutions. Chretien, Bush and Fox should each appoint five distinguished individuals outside of government to lead a North American Commission, or NAC. Unlike the European Commission--the EU's executive body--which is bureaucratic and executive, the NAC would be lean and advisory. Its mandate would be to define an agenda for the summit meetings of the three leaders and to provide a continental perspective, offering plans and options for North American infrastructure and transportation, uniform rules for customs and immigration and trilateral approaches to handle integration's dark side (drugs, illegal arms sales, etc.) without impeding the legitimate flow of people and goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of the three leaders, Mexico's Fox has been the boldest in proposing a common market within 20 years. Bush and Chretien have been cautious, but there is evidence that the public's mind is open to such an idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three leaders should agree to raise the lagging regions of North America, particularly the poorest areas of Mexico. The EU provides loans that represent 2% to 4% of the gross domestic product of the four poorest countries to improve their infrastructure and education. In just 15 years, these funds, good economic policies and the single market significantly reduced the disparities between the rich and poor countries of the EU. It would be hard to find a better investment in North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is an auspicious moment for the three leaders to step beyond the nasty disputes on drugs, immigration or softwood lumber and agree to a set of goals for all North Americans. Such an initiative would not only be good for all North Americans, it would also illuminate a path for other regions to emulate.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1783212944.xml", "text": "<h2>Five Big Truths About Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is, once again, a hot-button political issue, making this an unpropitious time for rational discourse about the subject. Nonetheless, here are five issues on which the overwhelming majority of economists, liberal and conservative, agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1. Most job losses are not due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Every month roughly five million new jobs are created in the U.S. and almost that many are destroyed, leaving a small net increment. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accounts for only a minor share of that staggering job churn. Vastly more derives from the hurly-burly of competition and from technological change, which literally creates and destroys entire industries. Competition and technology are widely and correctly applauded -- international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not so fortunate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is more about efficiency -- and hence wages -- than about the number of jobs. You probably don't sew your own clothes or grow your own food. Instead, you buy these things from others, using the wages you earn doing something you do better. Imagine how much lower your standard of living would be if you had to sew your own clothes, grow your own food . . . and a thousand other things.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is no different. It's not mainly about creating or destroying jobs. It's about using labor more efficiently, which is one key to higher wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is a catch: Whenever <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns change, some people will gain (either jobs or wages) but others will lose. The federal government could and should help them more, but it doesn't. So Americans who do lose their jobs due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have a legitimate gripe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. Bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalances are inevitable and mostly uninteresting. Each month I run a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Public Service Electric & Gas. They sell me gas and electricity; I sell them nothing. But I run a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Princeton University, to which I sell teaching services but from which I buy little. Should I seek balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with PSE&G or Princeton? Of course not. Neither should countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Running an overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit does not make us \"losers.\" The U.S. multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance -- its balance with all of its trading partners -- has been in deficit for decades. Does that mean that our country is in some sort of trouble? Probably not. For example, people who claim that our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit kills jobs need to explain how the U.S. managed to achieve 4% unemployment in 2000, when our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was larger, as a share of GDP, than it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit means that foreigners send us more goods and services than we send them. To balance the books, they get our IOUs, which means they wind up holding paper -- U.S. Treasury bills, corporate bonds or other private debt instruments. That doesn't sound so terrible for us, does it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exceptional country -- the U.S. -- is the source of the world's major international reserve currency, the U.S. dollar. Since ever-expanding world commerce requires ever more dollars, the U.S. must run <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits regularly. That's sometimes called our \"exorbitant privilege,\" since we get to import more than we export.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements barely affect a nation's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. Much of the political angst is directed not at <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in general, but at specific international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement allegedly shipped U.S. jobs to Mexico; the Trans-Pacific Partnership will allegedly ship U.S. jobs abroad as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a grain of truth here. Some U.S. jobs were indeed destroyed when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico -- and those people deserved better treatment from the government than they got. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also created a number of new jobs in the U.S. (See No. 2.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's more. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>\" and \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements\" are not synonyms. We <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d with Mexico long before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was growing. Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China has burgeoned in recent decades without a succession of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most fundamentally, but least understood, a nation's overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance is determined by its domestic decisions, not by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Think about the accounting involved here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As noted above, borrowing from abroad is the bookkeeping counterpart of running a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. One implies the other. The amount we borrow from abroad must equal the gap between our total spending as a nation (including government spending) and our total income (including the government's income from taxation). Spendthrift nations like the U.S. have <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits because we don't save much. But these saving decisions are domestic; they do not derive from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits stem from the dollar's international role and from Americans' decisions not to save much, not from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits are not a major cause of either job losses or job gains. But some people do lose their jobs from shifting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns; and the government should do more to help them. Importantly, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes American workers more productive and, presumably, better paid.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, would someone please tell this to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Look at the Darker Side of Free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Policy\" -- WSJ May. 3, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Alan S.

{"id": "1909555580.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump is deluded about NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration is determined to renegotiate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) -- which created a single market from Mexico's southern border to the Yukon -- but the main political appeal of this policy rests on a popular myth: that \"fair\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> requires the United States to have a surplus or balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with both Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are supposed to feel especially aggrieved that Mexico regularly has a sizable surplus with us, $63.2 billion in goods in 2016, according to Commerce Department figures. This shows, as the president repeatedly has said, that U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> officials negotiated a bad deal for American firms and workers. Trump has promised to do much better.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will be hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole theory of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> assumes that countries specialize in products and services where they have a relative advantage. On a global basis, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must balance; one country's imports are another country's exports. But some countries have surpluses and others have deficits, depending on their individual circumstances and histories.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all countries tried to balance their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with all other countries, global commerce would break down. It would be too difficult to match every nation's export capacities with every nation's import needs. \"Even China, with its large global [<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>] surpluses, runs deficits with a large number of countries that produce primary products (Saudi Arabia for oil, Australia for iron ore, etc.),\" writes economist C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in a new paper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists generally discount the significance of bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances (that is, balances between two countries) and focus on the overall effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on a country. Interestingly, Mexico and Canada prove the point.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given all the nationalistic rhetoric about their unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices, you might expect that Mexico and Canada have recorded huge global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. Not so, says Bergsten.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, as a share of their economies (gross domestic product, or GDP), Mexico and Canada have larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits than the United States, he notes. In 2016, the U.S. current account deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP compared with current account deficits of 3.3 percent of GDP for Canada and 2.7 percent of GDP for Mexico. (The current account is a broad measure of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalances within <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> aren't as large as they seem. It's true -- as noted -- that the United States had a $63.2 billion deficit in goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (cars, computers, plastics) with Mexico. But the U.S. surplus on services (travel, transportation, consulting) was $7.6 billion, reducing the overall deficit with Mexico to $55.6 billion. On the same basis, covering goods and services, the United States had a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus of $12.5 billion with Canada in 2016.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So: The total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico was $43.1 billion ($55.6 billion minus $12.5 billion). All <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- exports and imports -- between the United States and Canada and Mexico totaled $1.207 trillion in 2016. Our net deficit equaled 3.5 percent of total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and about two-tenths of 1 percent of U.S. GDP. This hardly seems crushing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against that backdrop, the notion that either Canada or Mexico is going to offer the United States vast new markets in their countries -- without corresponding U.S. concessions -- seems wishful thinking. \"The administration appears to perceive Mexico and perhaps Canada as surplus countries,\" writes Bergsten, \"whereas they (more accurately) see themselves as deficit countries,\" seeking to increase exports or dampen imports. This is Trump's delusion.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398998596.xml", "text": "<h2>Cross Country: Union Man</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raleigh, N.C. -- Presidential hopeful John Edwards is fond of telling us that he's the son of a mill worker. And, although he now lives in a mansion and sports expensive haircuts, he also has another thing in common with some wage earners. He's betting his future employment on the power of organized labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is this a safe bet? In Tar Heel, N.C., where organized labor is trying to unionize the largest meat processing plant in the world, that is a pressing question. And it's one that even Paula Deen, a popular host of a down-home cooking show on Food Network, may have to answer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Smithfield Foods slaughters more than 30,000 hogs a day in Tar Heel, employs some 5,500 people and pays competitive wages -- especially for the rural South. But the United Food and Commercial Workers union wants to organize the plant anyway, arguing that it will protect workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far Smithfield workers aren't going along. They have voted against forming a union, twice, and would likely do so again if another secret ballot election is held.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undeterred, union supporters have protested at one of Ms. Deen's book signings demanding that she cut ties to Smithfield. The union also wants to dispense with elections and unionize the plant through a controversial process called \"card check\" -- which merely requires gathering signatures from a majority of workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where Mr. Edwards enters the fray. He supports the union in its fight against Smithfield and he supports legislation under consideration in Congress that would make it easier to use the card check instead of an election. Mr. Edwards also recently sent a letter to Smithfield CEO Larry Pope demanding that he \"protect the right of workers\" to bargain collectively. He wants Mr. Pope to support the card check.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This -- his support for dispensing with secret ballot elections in the name of workers' rights -- makes Mr. Edwards one of the most pro- union presidential candidates in a long time. And it is a departure from who he was when he was elected to the Senate in 1998 as a Southern centrist. That reputation led then-Vice President Al Gore to consider tapping him as a running mate in 2000, and it was one reason why John Kerry put him on the ticket in 2004.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past three years, Mr. Edwards has moved sharply to the left. Indeed, he has lashed himself to the mast of organized labor and steered hard to port. His bet is that service-worker unions will propel him to a surprise victory in the early Nevada presidential caucus, giving him a shot at beating the better-financed campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also feels that he has found an underserved constituency -- people displaced by the New Economy. And he is on to something. Outside of edge cities and burgeoning metro areas, the painful churning in the economy is easy to spot. Think boarded-up textile mills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, this isn't the image North Carolina has as a prototypical New South state. The banking capital of Charlotte and the knowledge- worker Mecca of the Research Triangle are more familiar symbols. But North Carolina used to have one of the nation's highest rates of employment and economic production in manufacturing, which offered good pay and stable employment for people with relatively little education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past decade, however, there was a big change. Manufacturing made up just 22% of North Carolina's gross state product in 2005, down from 30% in 1997. Nationally, manufacturing's share of economic output only fell half as much (from 18% to 14%) during that time. Notwithstanding solid growth in Charlotte and other areas, North Carolina has trailed the nation in most measures of economic performance since the mid-1990s. Many North Carolinians still work in small industrial cities and rural counties, but, for the most part, they've had to be retrained at great effort and haven't yet replaced their former incomes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recognizing public trepidation about these events, Mr. Edwards and the labor movement lay blame on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and the decline of unionization. But international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't start with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, nor did the downward trend in manufacturing. Many textile executives in this state even supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, hoping to join with lower-cost factories south of the border and thereby compete with Asia producers. The problem is that the Chinese -- and others -- are now making better quality products than they used to. American consumers are getting more for their money.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The union response has been to push for higher wages and to oppose moving or laying off workers. That has made it harder to keep manufacturing jobs. Consider the textile giant Pillowtex, which was once a fixture in Cabarrus County under the name Fieldcrest Cannon. In the late 1990s it was unionized by the Union of Needle<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>s, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). In 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy and sought partners to complete a turnaround and keep at least some of its domestic production. One was Springs Industries in South Carolina. But UNITE helped scuttle the Springs deal in April 2003, fearing the loss of its newly won foothold at Pillowtex. A few months later Pillowtex closed its Cabarrus County mill, leaving the union nothing left to stand on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that exercising political power through a union isn't a substitute for innovation, retraining and other steps necessary to make economies competitive. Look at the numbers. From 1997 to 2005 the 10 states with the highest rates of union membership -- which include California, New York and Michigan, among others -- had slower growth than the bottom 10 states. North Carolina is among just five states with union membership rates below 5%. But it also has a predilection for raising taxes -- the Tax Foundation estimated this year it that it has the 19th heaviest tax burden in the country, up from 36th in 2000. Further unionizing the workforce will likely only make the state look more like the old Northeast and Rustbelt than the New South.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Edwards urges private-sector unionization as the best way to protect middle class jobs, he can only hope that unions are better at fulfilling electoral promises than economic ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, is the author of \"Selling the Dream\" (Praeger Publishers, 2005).</p>\n"}
{"id": "432679700.xml", "text": "<h2>And Now There Are Two</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On behalf of all the states that have not yet gone to the polls this year, we're pleased to see that the Democratic primary will still be chugging along when March arrives. True, the crowd has thinned. True, we already know the last man standing is going to be a U.S. senator named John. But in an age when too many elections seem to boil down to a choice between the unimaginable and the hardly bearable, the chance to pick between two perfectly good candidates for the presidential nomination seems like a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a campaign that began with a love affair between Howard Dean and the angry Democratic base, things have taken a peculiar and definitely dispassionate turn. John Kerry and John Edwards don't seem to disagree on many policy issues, and until now, they have avoided attacking each other. Voters probably like the positive spin the race is taking, but they may also have a nagging feeling that unpleasant surprises are being deferred: bits of biography, personal tics, hard-to-explain votes. What's best known about the two surviving candidates is that Mr. Kerry is a Vietnam combat veteran who seems like a winner, and that Mr. Edwards is a millworker's son who strikes some as even more electable than the front-runner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Edwards has a terrific stump speech -- people who see him for the first time frequently come away smitten. People who see him 10 or 12 times will discover that he has a talent for staying on message that makes even George Bush look unguarded. His political resume is short: the current Senate term he is completing is his first public office. On the plus side, that means Mr. Edwards has a relatively short record of votes with the potential to haunt him during a long campaign. (When he points out, as he now does constantly, that he didn't vote for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Mr. Edwards does not add that when the Senate passed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, he was still a lawyer in North Carolina.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Kerry, who has been in the Senate since 1985, has a far longer paper trail and a harder time restraining himself from wandering off into the complexities of an issue. Listeners can find his explanation of why he voted for President Bush's war resolution either deeply nuanced or practically endless. But his gravitas and long experience with foreign policy issues might provide reassurance to a jittery electorate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards deserves -- and frequently demands -- credit for speaking so consistently about the problems of the poor and the continuing challenge of racial discrimination in America. He is more conservative than Mr. Kerry about the amount he is willing to commit to a national health care plan. He supports the death penalty, and Mr. Kerry opposes it -- except when it comes to terrorists. Their positions on gay marriage are slightly different and hard to parse, but both come down somewhere in the general area of civil unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both men have shown a willingness to take a dive on principle to advance ambition. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry both followed up their support for the Iraq resolution with a vote against the $87 billion authorization needed to support American troops there and in Afghanistan. And it's too bad that their fiercest competition is a battle to see who can outpander the other on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Mr. Edwards hammered hard on Mr. Kerry's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vote as he wooed blue-collar workers in Wisconsin, and Mr. Kerry picked up the theme, lashing out at George Bush's economic adviser for daring to suggest that there are positive aspects to outsourcing jobs abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards has won only one primary to Mr. Kerry's 15, but he had a critical victory over expectations in Wisconsin. In the current political culture, nearly winning a supposedly one-sided race counts for a lot. Bill Clinton, after all, became the ''Comeback Kid'' when he succeeded in coming back to second place in New Hampshire. The chances of an Edwards ascendancy still seem minuscule. No candidate with Mr. Kerry's kind of lead has lost a nomination since the modern primary system began.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, we have lived through a lot of impossibilities since this time four years ago, and have stopped counting on the normal thing happening.

{"id": "419769161.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA and the case for CAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sugar is a good place to start a debate on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Most people eat sugar--probably too much of it this time of year--in one form or another. This sweet, mundane commodity is about to take center stage in another ferocious battle on Capitol Hill over the relative benefits and costs of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ten years after the U.S., Mexico and Canada signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, you might think that debate would be nearer a resolution. But even with a decade's worth of empirical data, it's still murky going. About the only statistic pro- and anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> forces agree on is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the partners has more than doubled over the decade, to $621 billion last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has brought lower prices and more choices for American consumers, and larger markets for U.S. manufacturers. Did it cost jobs or create them? It did both, but neither in quantities that have had much of an impact on the more than $11 trillion U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico had the most to gain or lose from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and yet, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the pact has been neither the disaster predicted by critics nor the miracle promised by supporters. The World Bank, in its 10-year assessment, found that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has helped Mexico move toward the development levels of the U.S. and Canada. Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the report says, per capita income in Mexico is about 5 percent higher, foreign investment 40 percent higher, and exports 25 percent higher than they otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements alone can't bring prosperity--and it's certainly true that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't done that in Mexico. But the reasons have less to do with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and more to do with Mexico's failure to reform its economy and invest more in its citizens. Mexican President Vicente Fox understands this, but his attempts to remake the tax system, pour more money into education and innovation, and reform the rigid labor market have so far failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most 10th anniversary assessments of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> acknowledge that it's hard to separate out the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> effects from all the rest that was going on in the world over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even without this pact, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers had begun to fall everywhere, toppled by successful multilateral negotiations in the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and its predecessor organization. Mexico suffered a crippling currency crisis in the mid-1990s. The three- year bust after the U.S. boom has cost millions of jobs here and had a ripple effect on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners. The rapid rise of China as an economic force majeure has astonished and unsettled the rest of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, on balance, has succeeded in doing precisely what it was intended to do: reduce <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and increase <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the partners. But that doesn't mean critics won't continue to blame it for every lost job. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in general is under fierce assault. The critics rail that it hurts workers and wrecks the environment; it's capitalism run amok.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s benefits flow throughout an economy in the form of lower prices and more choices. They are diffuse and sometimes difficult to quantify. In contrast, its costs are borne--painfully-- by specific workers in easily identifiable industries, such as electronics manufacturing. Mostly for this reason, none of the Democratic contenders for president supports free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements in their current form. Even the ostensibly pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> President Bush has engaged in protectionism in steel and textiles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization talks are stalled, as is Bush's ambitious Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas, which would reduce or eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among 34 Western Hemisphere nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against this bleak backdrop and its own protectionist missteps, the administration doggedly continues to push the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> case. The U.S.-Chile free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement takes effect in January and now El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have signed on to a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with the U.S. that is modeled after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic may yet join that pact, dubbed CAFTA (Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pact would eliminate industrial tariffs and reduce agricultural subsidies among the partners over more than a decade. But navigating CAFTA through Congress is going to be a tough slog and sugar is a major reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans pay two to three times the world market price for sugar because the U.S. government since 1981 has guaranteed a minimum price for domestic growers of sugar cane and sugar beets. It does this by restricting imports and buying and storing--or even destroying--excess production. (This is the kind of behavior the U.S. would consider outrageous protectionism if some other country were doing it.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The price of protecting sugar growers from cheaper imports, according to General Accounting Office estimates, is that sugar users--food manufacturers and consumers--pay an extra $1.9 billion a year. Mayor Richard Daley last year blamed these price supports for the general exodus of the candy industry from Chicago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAFTA doesn't even propose to get rid of sugar import quotas. But it would raise the current U.S. limit by 75 percent next year and allow a 2 percent increase in each of the next 15 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That concession is viewed as outright capitulation by the powerful U.S. sugar lobby, which vows to fight CAFTA in Congress. If the sugar lobby is successful, Americans will continue to pay more than they should, cheaper sugar from Central America will be barred from our shores, and the U.S. will continue to speak with a forked tongue on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. (Do as we say, not as we do.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact would extend the legacy of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Central America, opening once-closed markets and creating vibrant new opportunities. There is no question that it would disrupt protected industries both here and in other countries. But new opportunities can't flourish if the status quo doesn't change. Helping displaced workers from the sugar and other affected industries find those new opportunities is a wiser investment in America's future than protecting the principle that we should all continue to pay more for sugar. That's not sweet; it's a sweetheart deal gone sour.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2324582854.xml", "text": "<h2>Nearly normal</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IS GOVERNANCE still possible in Washington? Tuesday's announcement of a bipartisan deal that seems to assure eventual passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) surprisingly suggests that the answer might be 'yes.' That, as much or more than the actual substance of this updated version of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, represents the true significance of the moment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To watch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a Capitol podium, surrounded by Democratic committee chairs, including her point man on the bill, Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) of the Ways and Means Committee, was to travel back in time to the days when legislation was still, as they say, a thing. To be sure, in recent weeks Ms. Pelosi seemed to be straining for reasons to oppose an agreement, negotiated by President Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, that addresses many long-standing Democratic complaints about the alleged harm to U.S. manufacturing workers caused by outsourcing to Mexico. Even if it was partly \" or mostly \" Kabuki, the speaker's extended show of reluctance was necessary both as a bargaining tactic with Mr. Lighthizer and as political cover for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-deal-skeptic labor unions in her party coalition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for substance, the 25-year-old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> needed updating in light of changes to global supply chains and e-commerce. Mr. Trump made it harder by extravagantly denouncing the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, to which hemispheric businesses had long since adapted, and by reopening sensitive provisions regarding how much domestic content autos must contain to qualify for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three countries. Still, in 2018, he and Mr. Lighthizer 'succeeded' in adding new, stricter domestic-content rules, as well as a kind of minimum wage for Mexican autoworkers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The net effect is to impose more managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the hemisphere, not a freer flow of goods. However, because that conformed to a long-standing Democratic demand, it would have been inconsistent for Ms. Pelosi to sustain resistance to the measure once her party took the House majority back. She did manage to satisfy her caucus's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-deal skeptics by diluting intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical makers and by adding an arbitration mechanism to enforce higher labor standards in Mexico. Much has been made of the fact that she pulled this off while simultaneously spearheading the impeachment of the president, but that might have favored a compromise, since members of her caucus from swing districts in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-dependent states such as Texas badly wanted the USMCA as proof that they could take on the president and make necessary new laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump can now crow that he kept a campaign promise. Ms. Pelosi and her colleagues can do the same. Both will claim credit for helping to create jobs. The global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment environment still roiled by Mr. Trump's tariffs on China and others \" and bracing for at least a temporary lapsing of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization's legal enforcement mechanism, brought about in part by Mr. Trump's policies \" will benefit from a dose of calm. In Washington, just for a moment, it's politics as usual, or what used to be usual. Kind of refreshing.</p>\n"}

During that 90 minutes, in a charmless version of his old cracker-barrel act, dogs didn't hunt, lines in the sand were drawn and the tooth fairy was mentioned twice. \"It'll only take a minute to kill this snake.\" \"If you believe that, I got a lot of stuff in the attic I can sell you.\" You know. Ross Perot's easier to imitate than Jimmy Durante.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot had a purpose in American politics for a fleeting moment during the last Presidential election.  He said that the emperor had no clothes, that Washington was a hollow place that ran on incestuous connections among lobbyists, journalists, and elected and appointed officials.  While campaignspeak was filled with smoothie rhetoric, Mr. Perot's was filled with the kind of aphorisms you'd expect to find in a fortune cookie at a Tex-Mex restaurant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several things have happened since. One is that the choir learned the song. There's barely a person in America who doesn't suspect that Washington deal-making has as much to do with the public weal as a black widow spider has to do with romance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(That common understanding doesn't mean an end to politics as usual: on the same day that Ross and Al did Yosemite Sam and Crusader Rabbit, Ed Rollins, who managed Christine Todd Whitman's successful race for governor of New Jersey, boasted to reporters that the campaign paid black ministers and Democratic regulars not to rally voters for Jim Florio. Yesterday he retracted the story, leaving Mrs. Whitman fuming, the ministers raging and the rest of us scratching our heads.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Rollins, who parted bitterly with Mr. Perot after briefly managing his on-again, off-again Presidential race, ever wonders how the man could marshal so much support out of American disillusionment, he might just look in the mirror and wave a ten dollar bill at his own reflection.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot's allure evaporated, not only because people got the message, but because the messenger's act wore thin. And the act was all there was -- no action, just a stream of tetchy twang.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ross Perot became the political equivalent of the person who says he could write your column without breaking a sweat. Problem is, he's never sat down at the typewriter. Mr. Perot doesn't have to deal with Congress or run the government -- he only runs his mouth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm in sympathy with those members of Congress who haven't yet decided how to vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It's fraught with ambiguity: could cost jobs in the short run, boost exports in the long run. But Americans hate ambiguity. That's why so many of them liked Mr. Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President thought he was killing two birds with one stone with this debate -- win friends for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and reveal Mr. Perot as a crank. Mr. Perot, accustomed to appearing on \"Larry King Live\" as the centerpiece, was relegated to a place setting, and indeed it made him cranky.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He tried to replay portions of the Presidential race he popped in and out of like a flea with two dogs. (See -- we could probably even teach Al Gore to do this sort of thing.) He had his customary share of hyperbole: is this really \"the biggest lobbying effort in the history of our country\"? He also misjudged his audience, talking about the oppressed working people of Mexico; if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> fails, it will be because Americans think it will hurt the oppressed working people of the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Usually columnists complain when a debate is lively that it's not substantive enough, or when it's substantive it's dull.

If, as the Vice President said, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is right up there with the Louisiana Purchase, people deserved to hear more about both sides than they got on TV.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the evening accomplished one thing: it insures that, from now on, no one need afford Mr. Perot a platform from which to air what pass as his opinions. He's been called a demagogue, a populist and a gadfly. What he is, is over.</p>\n"}
{"id": "422327674.xml", "text": "<h2>How to swing arms control</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has scored his first foreign policy triumph by persuading the Russians to join him in a major reduction of nuclear arms. But if his initiative is to succeed, he must gain the support of another skeptical bargaining partner: the U.S. Congress. His fate in this second round will probably depend on the constitutional path he takes in gaining legislative approval.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has two choices. He can ask two-thirds of the Senate to ratify the agreement as a treaty under Article II of the Constitution. Or he can ask a simple majority of both the House and the Senate to approve it as a congressional executive agreement under Article I. President Nixon took the latter path when he negotiated our first arms agreement with the Soviet Union in 1972.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reviving nuclear arms control for a new age, Obama should follow Nixon's constitutional example. Otherwise, he will confront the familiar prospect of Senate obstructionism. It was hard enough for Obama to get the 60 senators he would have needed to prevent a filibuster on healthcare. Going the treaty route would require 67 votes to approve the pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Obama submits the agreement to both houses for approval, he will still need 60 Senate votes to avoid a filibuster, but that is a far more manageable number, and final approval will only require a simple majority vote. In these partisan times, passing the agreement won't be easy, but there is a reasonable chance that Obama's initiative will carry the day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate opponents will undoubtedly cry foul and try to portray the two-house option as a devious trick to deprive the Senate of its exclusive authority to advise and consent on international agreements. They will note that every president since Nixon has used the treaty route on major nuclear arms accords. But the Arms Control and Disarmament Act recognizes the equal legitimacy of the two-house process, and explicitly gives the president the authority to determine which of the two options he should exercise in respect to an agreement. And the congressional executive agreement has been used in other defense-related matters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama can invoke two basic principles to justify taking this path as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, he can note that the two-house procedure is more democratic. Given Senate malapportionment, members representing only 8% of Americans could provide the 34 votes needed to reject a treaty. By comparison, the 41 required to mount a successful filibuster against a congressional executive agreement seems a large step in the democratic direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two-house process is also more efficient. Even if the Senate does consent to a treaty, the entire lawmaking process must start all over again to approve the necessary implementing legislation, and at that point the Constitution requires the House to function as the Senate's equal partner. Although Article II authorizes the Senate to ratify treaties, Article I requires all legislation to go through both chambers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, if Obama calls for a congressional executive agreement, the House is involved from the get-go. This allows him to package the agreement with the Russians and the implementing legislation together for a single vote -- permitting the president and Congress to move on to other pressing business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The congressional executive agreement is more democratic and less time-consuming than the treaty alternative. Consequently, it has increasingly become the vehicle of choice for many kinds of international agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. After an intense nationwide debate catalyzed by Ross Perot, the Senate voted 61 to 38 to approve President Clinton's initiative. Clinton had submitted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a congressional executive agreement, so this vote sufficed to assure final passage because the House also passed the measure, 234 to 200. If Clinton had proposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a treaty, the Senate vote would have killed the entire effort.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With creative leadership, Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) might well win 61 Senate votes for arms control. It would be a tragedy if their political success were translated into legal failure because they failed to follow Nixon and Clinton down the right constitutional path.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Bruce Ackerman and Oona Hathaway are professors of law at Yale University</p>\n"}

It was a moment of optimism about the prospects of the global economy, and the apogee of Clinton's New Democrat argument that the United States could compete and win in the world economy, provided its workers were given the \"tools\"  --  mostly job training and education  --  to be competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a lovely synthesis, and to a large degree it worked. Spurred by new technologies, the American economy took off in the 1990s. By the final Clinton years, even workers stuck at the bottom were starting to experience higher wages and living standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not the '90s anymore, though, and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> coalition's happy days are over. Since the end of the Clinton-era boom, the costs of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, in the form of lost manufacturing jobs, have become more important to many voters than the benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not that the country is about to move to protectionism, despite talk of a tougher stance toward China. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not about to be repealed. But a giddiness about global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has been replaced by a grumpy skepticism over whether wages and living standards are rising as fast as profits. \"The economy has changed a great deal in the last 10 years,\" says Rep. Adam Smith, a New Democrat from Washington state who, like Tauscher, voted to give Bush <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority but, also like Tauscher, is opposing CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There has always been a certain attitude among some economists and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advocates that the issue is simply <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: Reduce the barriers and move forward,\" Smith says. \"What we've discovered in the last 10 or 15 years is that, yes, that's a part of it, but if you want to reduce poverty and move people to the middle class, you need more than that. You need an emphasis on workers' rights. A balance must be struck between the short-term needs of business and the needs of workers.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tauscher argues that \"a safety net is just not there for people who are without a job or without skills in an increasingly difficult environment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is, in a sense, not so much a battle against Clinton's grand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> vision as it is a protest against the failure to realize that vision. The promises of training, education and uplift for those hurt in the globalization process have not been met. CAFTA is caught in a cross fire of disappointment. It is thus, says Smith, \"as good a place as any to say that these changes need to happen.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAFTA's troubles are a warning to free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs that, absent more attention to the interests of the displaced, the already fraying free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> consensus could fall apart. They are also a sign of the impatience of moderates with the inclination of Republican congressional leaders, especially in the House, to freeze out the Democrats from any influence on legislation. \"It forces us further to the left because we are without anything to vote for,\" Tauscher says. \"It prevents us from working in a bipartisan way to achieve any compromise.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words: no calls, no letters, no flowers, no worker rights, no CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>postchat@aol.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "421117090.xml", "text": "<h2>A Shining Tour for Clinton, but Big Problems Remain; Now Latin America policy should be made to the rhetoric</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Measured in terms of diplomacy and political showmanship, President Clinton's belated first trip to Latin America was a solid success. But we should not be too relaxed, for no single performance, however professional, can assure a smooth road for the United States and Mexico and the other countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Sore points in the complex and intense relationships can flare at a moment's notice, and the goodwill that was evident in last week's multi-country trip can lose its luster before improved relations can be built upon it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President and Mrs. Clinton performed their parts to perfection on the five-day movable feast, mending some fences, playing to the crowds. The president presented his ideas on key topics like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, illicit drugs and immigration, important issues at every stop. None of this promised to raise Latin America's profile in Washington's foreign policy, but it was useful to both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mexico, Clinton gave a boost to a relationship that had been going downhill for at least three years. He spoke of the things that neighbors must address: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, immigration, crime and interdependence. Alas, the positive feeling may last only until the next border incident or political scandal sends the relationship reeling again. That's how it is between neighbors, especially when there are points to be made in national politics on both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo made ringing speeches and signed thoughtful documents many months in the making. Take for example the so-called Declaration of the Mexican/U.S. Alliance Against Drugs. The document spells out the danger that drugs pose to both societies in terms of corruption, addiction, crime and violence. These were good, strong words. But words come easily, achievements less so. Breakthrough action is needed: the arrest of Mexican drug lords like Amado Carrillo or the infamous Arellano brothers of Baja California, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another big help would be the elimination of Washington's ill-chosen annual drug-trafficking certification process, which ties bilateral relations and specific programs to a nation's progress in the drug war. Practical help, not diplomatic censure, is what is needed. The drug economy is a three-legged stool: growers, traffickers and users--and most of the users live in American cities and towns. Full acknowledgment of this by U.S. politicians would be a step toward defeat of the menace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regarding immigration issues, the Clinton message was the same in both Mexico and Central America. The United States is a country of immigrants but it is also a country of laws. And the law, the president emphasized, applies to all. Almost 900,000 foreigners immigrated legally to the United States last year, and they should be welcomed. But Clinton stressed again that the U.S. government will do all it can to prevent illegal immigration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a speech in San Jose, Costa Rica, Clinton mentioned he was aware of the potential for destabilization that a mass deportation of illegal residents could have on the economies of Mexico and Central America and promised that none would be ordered.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with immigration and drug trafficking, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was a major topic of the five-day trip. Clinton, a supporter of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Mexico and Canada in his 1991 presidential campaign, remains positive on the long-term outlook. Bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico alone has increased 60% since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was established. Organized labor in the United States remains opposed, and that factor may diminish general enthusiasm for an even wider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This presidential tour leaves us with memories of the 1994 Miami Summit and its promises of cooperation and a hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement starting with Chile in 1995. But then came the Mexican peso crisis, Clinton's attention turned to reelection politics and none of the grand promises made in Miami came to pass. No doubt the Miami summit overreached. Latin American presidents were disappointed. A second Summit of the Americas will be held in Santiago, Chile, next year. Progress may come then, but the experience of these recent years should prevent high expectations.</p>\n"}

In fact, Mr. Trump's efforts to rewrite that mechanism go not only to the heart of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> but also to the very center of how Canada sees its relationship with its southern neighbor.

In 1994, there was a case involving the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in live swine. A recent case dealt with supercalendered -- glossy -- paper.

We insisted that the pact build up rules as well as tear down tariffs. But the United States had demanded that disputes be dealt with in its own courts.

Many Canadians believe that Mexico caved to Mr. Trump, putting Canada in a precarious position as the outlier. The real issue here, as before, is the power imbalance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dispute-resolution issue is similar to the other main obstacles facing negotiators: Canada's protection of its culture and dairy sectors. Canadians are intensely protective of their culture, especially when it is so close to, and so often overshadowed by, the United States'. Because the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal included protections for what Canada considered the critical pieces of its cultural heritage, Ottawa has insisted that such protection be maintained in any new deal; Washington, obviously, disagrees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dairy is also a case where the principle may seem more important than the practical. Canada sets domestic prices for dairy products; for this to work, it needs to place limits on how much milk and cheese it imports. Canadian negotiators are willing to loosen up on some of those limits, as long as the country's command-and-control system survives. But that system is exactly what Mr. Trump has attacked with his tweets about \"270 percent tariffs,\" which in fact are rarely applied.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the reason these talks have been so hard is that the two sides see them in fundamentally different terms.

{"id": "433737751.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade and Prosperity</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With most polls showing that voters believe <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with other countries is hurting the American economy, it is not surprising that there has been a lot of posturing about the perils of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats have been most tempted by the protectionism. John Edwards likes to talk about how <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ''have hurt workers and families while helping corporate insiders.'' Senator Hillary Clinton has suggested that the economic theories underpinning the cause for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> no longer hold, and has said she would review all of the United States' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even Republican candidates -- normally staunch supporters of expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- can sound skeptical. ''I don't want to see our food come from China, our oil come from Saudi Arabia and our manufacturing come from Europe and Asia,'' complained Mike Huckabee. Mitt Romney defends globalization's record of improving living standards, but cannot resist drawing an applause line by adding that the government should negotiate better with other countries to make sure ''the American worker gets a fair shake.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be unfortunate for the United States if the winner of the 2008 election elevated skepticism toward <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> from a red-meat sound bite on the campaign trail to a new wave of protectionist policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans are experiencing economic anxiety. Wages for most workers are going nowhere. It is a sad fact that despite enormous gains in productivity over the past few decades, the wages of typical workers are only marginally higher than they were a quarter of a century ago. But throttling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- say, by reconsidering existing agreements -- would hurt a lot more people than it helped. There is scant evidence that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has played a big role in holding down typical workers' wages. There is abundant evidence that it has contributed substantially to America's overall economic growth. It offers American producers access to foreign markets. It multiplies choices for producers and consumers. Foreign competition spurs productivity growth at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, like technological change, can produce wrenching dislocations that hurt some workers. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers are not the proper tool to deal with these changes. What is needed is a bold strategy to rebuild a functioning safety net, deploying some of the vast wealth this nation has gained through globalization to assist those hurt by the forces of economic change. This will allow Americans to embrace globalization, rather than fear it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The planks of this strategy include health care reform, to ensure that workers who lose their jobs do not also lose access to affordable health insurance, and a form of extended unemployment insurance for all displaced workers, not just those hurt by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. More progressive taxation -- using tools like the earned income tax credit -- should be used to address the stagnation of incomes. And more should be spent on the continuous training and education of workers throughout their lives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is unclear whether the next president will have the vision to carry through these changes. The Republican candidates' posturing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has been pretty much substance-free. But considering the field's uniform approach to economic policy, in which all taxes are bad and most nondefense spending is worse, it is unlikely that a Republican president would be interested in investing in such an expansion of America's social safety net.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic candidates, on the other hand, tend to be on the right side of the discussion on issues like universal health care, education and social spending. But all of them have included hints of defensive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies amid their proposals. Barack Obama has offered the most resistance to the easy path of blaming imports from foreign countries for the woes of the American middle class. ''Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not going away, technology is not going away, the Internet is not going away,'' he said in New Hampshire. ''And that means enormous opportunities, but also means more dislocations.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mrs. Clinton proposes a ''timeout'' on future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, including the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization's global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, and a reconsideration of existing deals -- including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a cornerstone of Bill Clinton's presidency. Mr. Edwards also talks of ''redoing'' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. All the Democratic candidates agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements should be amended to attach provisions about minimum labor standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These changes would do virtually nothing to protect American workers from the disruptions wrought by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, technology and other economic forces. A protectionist agenda would hurt them.</p>\n"}

It\u2019s a set of modest revisions to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \u2014 the old deal \u2014 and President Trump is exaggerating their significance so he can claim to have replaced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI made a wonderful new sandwich by adding Lettuce and Tomato to Bacon and some bread,\u201d the historian Kevin Kruse tweeted . \u201cI\u2019m calling it the LTB!\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what about the modest revisions to the deal? They\u2019re a mix of good and bad, as Matthew Yglesias of Vox notes . The bad include changes that make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> more bureaucratically cumbersome. The deal expands some needlessly complex patent rules. It also has a version of a sunset clause, which may force future rounds of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, as Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas and Mariano S\u00e1nchez-Talanquer explain in The Times .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good include changes to automobile-industry rules that could shift more manufacturing to higher-wage factories, which could help workers. Unfortunately, those new automobile rules also are an example of a widespread problem with economic policy: They do not include inflation adjustments. This sounds like a wonky issue, I realize, but it\u2019s actually a big deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When a policy doesn\u2019t adjust for inflation, it often builds in its own effective demise. That\u2019s why the federal minimum wage has lost a lot of value in recent decades and why alcohol taxes have lost much of their bite . In the case of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0, the deal calls for a larger share of auto jobs to be in factories that pay production workers at least $16 an hour. But as The Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley notes , $16 an hour won\u2019t be worth as much in the future as it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Related: Annie Lowrey of The Atlantic makes the succinct case for higher alcohol taxes, and the economist Philip Cook has made a much longer case, in an excellent book called \u201c Paying the Tab.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u2018Not thinking.\u2019 Trump mocked two female reporters during his news conference on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal yesterday, telling one, \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking. You never do.\u201d The insult fits a pattern, Amber Phillips of The Washington Post explains: \u201cWhen Trump wants to attack women, he often resorts to stereotypes, reducing women to their looks or their intellect (or supposed lack of it) in many instances.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Shannon Watts , the gun-safety advocate, noted, referring to Trump\u2019s advisers: \u201cPlease note the mostly (white) men standing behind the President in the Rose Garden who laugh and smirk as he insults the women who are trying to do their jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>F.B.I. investigation.  Trump\u2019s decision yesterday to allow the F.B.I. to decide how to conduct the brief investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is good news. It doesn\u2019t guarantee fairness, by any means. Much of the investigation remains shrouded from public view or accountability. But the change increases the chances that the Senate will have more information when it votes on the nomination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David Leonhardt</p>\n"}
{"id": "1883073849.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Is Wimping Out on Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign, Donald Trump talked loudly and often about how he was going to renegotiate America's \"horrible <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals,\" bringing back millions of good jobs. So far, however, nothing has happened. Not only is Trumpist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy -- Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>? -- nowhere to be seen in practice; there isn't even any indication of what it will involve.So on Friday the White House scheduled a ceremony in which Mr. Trump would sign two new executive orders on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The goal, presumably, was to counteract the growing impression that his bombast on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was sound and fury signifying nothing.Unfortunately, the executive orders in question were, to use the technical term, nothingburgers. One called for a report on the causes of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit; wait, they're just starting to study the issue? The other addressed some minor issues of tariff collection, and its content apparently duplicated an act President Obama already signed last year.Not surprisingly, reporters at the event questioned the president, not about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but about Michael Flynn and the Russia connection. Mr. Trump then walked out of the room -- without signing the orders. (Vice President Mike Pence gathered them up, and the White House claims that they were signed later.)The fiasco perfectly encapsulated what's looking more and more like a failed agenda.Business seems to have decided that Mr. Trump is a paper tiger on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: The flow of corporate relocations to Mexico, which slowed briefly while C.E.O.s tried to curry favor with the new president, has resumed. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> policy by tweet, it appears, has run its course.Investors seem to have reached the same conclusion: The Mexican peso plunged 16 percent after the election, but since Inauguration Day it has recovered almost all the lost ground.Oh, and last week a draft proposal for revising the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement circulated around Congress; instead of sweeping changes in what candidate Trump called the \"worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal\" ever signed, the administration appears to be seeking only modest tweaks.This surely isn't what working-class Trump supporters thought they were voting for. So why can Trumpist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy be summarized -- to quote The Times's Binyamin Appelbaum -- as \"talk loudly and carry a small stick\"? Let me give two reasons.First, back when Mr. Trump was railing against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, he had no idea what he was talking about. (I know, you're shocked to hear that.)For example, listening to the Tweeter-in-chief, you'd think that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a big giveaway by the United States, which got nothing in return. In fact, Mexico drastically cut its tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., in return for much smaller cuts on the U.S. side.Or take Mr. Trump's repeated claims that China gains a competitive advantage by manipulating its currency. That was true six years ago, but it's not true now. These days China is actually intervening to keep its currency up, not down.Talking nonsense about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't hurt Mr. Trump during the campaign. But now he's finding out that those grossly unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals he promised to renegotiate aren't all that unfair, after all, leaving him with no idea what to do next.Which brings me to Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s second big obstacle: Whatever you think of past <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is now deeply embedded in the economy.Consider the case of automobiles. At this point it makes little sense to talk about a U.S. auto industry, a Canadian auto industry or a Mexican auto industry. What we have instead is a tightly integrated North American industry, in which vehicles and components crisscross the continent, with almost every finished car containing components from all three nations.Does it have to be this way? No. Slap on 30 percent tariffs, and after a few years those national industries would separate again. But the transition would be chaotic and painful.Economists talk, with considerable justification, about the \"China shock\": the disruptive effect on jobs and communities of the rapid growth of Chinese exports from the 1990s through 2007. But reversing globalization now would produce an equally painful \"Trump shock,\" disrupting jobs and communities all over again -- and would also be painful for some of the big corporate interests that, strange to say, have a lot of influence in this supposedly populist regime.The point is that at a deep level Trump<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is running into the same wall that caused Trumpcare to crash and burn. Mr. Trump came into office talking big, sure that his predecessors had messed everything up and he -- he alone -- could do far better. And millions of voters believed him.But governing America isn't like reality TV. A few weeks ago Mr. Trump whined, \"Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\" Now, one suspects, he's saying the same thing about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy.Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.

{"id": "2171052987.xml", "text": "<h2>Sherrod Brown Sends Regrets; The Democrat was supposed to support new Nafta. Guess not.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer spent nearly as much effort last year courting Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown as he did Republicans while renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. So how's that working out now that Donald Trump needs Democratic votes to pass the revised U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement (USMCA)?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I appreciate the efforts to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" Mr. Brown said</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>last week. \"But the president's not even close to being in the right place on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if he's not going to have strong enforcement for labor standards, which they don't have yet.\" Mark him down as a \"no.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Brown has suggested restarting negotiations with Mexico's new President, the left-wing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, \"who is more pro-worker than the outgoing President that signed USMCA.\" But Mexico says it has no desire to renegotiate and, even if it did, moving the deal even further left could cost Republican votes crucial to passage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another Democratic critic is Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, whose district includes the Chevy Cruze plant in Lordstown that is being shut down. Mr. Ryan said this month that new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s labor rules provide \"no real mechanism for quick enforcement,\" adding that \"there's gotta be penalties, there's gotta be ramifications.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was all predictable. Mr. Lighthizer's bet was that by moving to the protectionist left on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>--mandating higher wages for Mexican auto workers, for example--Democrats and U.S. unions would come around. But Democrats don't like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals even when Democratic Presidents negotiate them. At most they provide a minority of pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> votes. That's why we urged Messrs. Lighthizer and Trump to renegotiate and vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> while Republicans ran the House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats don't want to hand Mr. Trump a victory, and some of them probably hope that if they reject his new deal he'll respond by blowing up the current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Some Republicans seem to think this would increase the President's leverage in trying to pass the USMCA deal. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley said this month that if Democrats insist on going back to the negotiating table, \"I would encourage the President to pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be political suicide. If Mr. Trump dynamites <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> without the votes to replace it, he'll take the blame for whatever economic harm results. Mr. Brown may run for President, so at least Mr. Trump would be guaranteed a good seat for President Brown's inaugural address.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "1889642150.xml", "text": "<h2>U.S. News -- Capital Account: Is Trump Turning Globalist? Not So Fast</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Western capitals and Washington's punditocracy there was shock mixed with approval as President Donald Trump intervened in Syria's war, reaffirmed the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and decided not to label China a currency manipulator.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But before anyone concludes Mr. Trump has gone globalist, a reality check is in order. Recent events show that his approach to the world has bifurcated, turning traditionally internationalist on foreign policy while remaining nationalist on economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, as Mr. Trump launched cruise missiles at Syria and rattled sabers at North Korea, he also ordered an examination of abusive foreign actions that contribute to U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, expanded the categories of illegal immigrants prioritized for deportation, tightened \"buy American\" requirements for federal spending and clamped down on foreign worker visas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This bifurcation tracks Mr. Trump's own philosophical priorities and the evolution of the party he leads. Republicans have long favored a muscular approach to national security founded on military alliances. As a candidate Mr. Trump defied that consensus with his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggestions that South Korea and Japan develop nuclear weapons, and his dismissal of NATO as obsolete.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own,\" he said in an inaugural address largely written by his most nationalist advisers, Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Trump's mistrust of foreign entanglements is rooted less in principle than resentment at paying for them. That has left him open to persuasion by traditional foreign policy hawks such as Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Mr. Bannon has been removed from the National Security Council, now headed by committed internationalist H.R. McMaster.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economic issues, by contrast, are the foundation of Mr. Trump's worldview and his movement. Since the 1980s, the New York businessman has believed other countries use free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to rip off Americans. His strident attacks on illegal immigrants separated him from his rivals during the Republican primary campaign. His appointments, in part, reflect those views: Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has spearheaded the crackdown on illegal immigration, while Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is studying how to use existing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tools more aggressively against imports. Messrs. Miller and Bannon accompanied Mr. Trump on a trip to Wisconsin on Tuesday, where the president railed against the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and Canadian restrictions on milk imports, and called the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization a \"disaster\" while signing an executive order stiffening \"buy American\" rules and conditions for H-1B visas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On immigration and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the Republican working-class base is closer to Mr. Trump than its other leaders. That base prevented Republican leaders in Congress from striking a deal legalizing undocumented immigrants. The base now also sees free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as bad, which has sapped support for it in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, Mr. Trump hasn't been the wrecking ball that many feared. The Mexican peso, which plunged after his election, has recouped those losses as Mr. Trump signaled he would seek relatively modest changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He has yet to hit any country or company with a punitive import tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars and shredded treaties were never the likeliest outcome. The point of Mr. Trump's threats was to extract concessions. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, he wants the right to hit Mexico and Canada with tariffs if imports from either surge. In declining to name China a currency manipulator Mr. Trump, besides acknowledging reality, concluded like previous presidents that withholding the designation could encourage Chinese cooperation on North Korea. Whether that calculus is wise remains to be seen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump has ample tools for punishing foreign competitors including China without tearing up any existing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. His nominees as U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative and commerce undersecretary, Robert Lighthizer and Gilbert Kaplan, are masters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law minutiae and how to deploy it against foreign companies and governments. The administration has already signaled a greater readiness to act outside the WTO.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More unilateral action on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by itself doesn't spell the end of the global trading system; the world has survived bouts of protectionism before -- for example, under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. But Mr. Reagan was at heart a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r; Mr. Trump isn't. At a time when protectionism and nationalism are on the rise everywhere, the world economy can't count on the U.S. as a counterweight just because its president is willing to drop bombs on Syria and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "2115976212.xml", "text": "<h2>U.S. News -- Capital Account: Trade Deal Shows Limits of 'America First'</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is a bitter pill to swallow. It introduces managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to autos, waters down foreign rights of corporations and normalizes national security as a pretext for tariffs. Many of its improvements, such as on intellectual property and labor rights, were already in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which President Trump has withdrawn.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the verdict is different when judged by a different standard -- how the world's trading system survives the most protectionist U.S. administration in memory. The new deal shows the limits to Mr. Trump's \"America First\" agenda and an underlying resilience to the existing order. The reason: The resistance Mr. Trump encountered from Congress, business, his own advisers and U.S. trading partners circumscribed his leverage and may again in the future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the outset, the U.S. held all the cards: Mexico and Canada depended far more on exports to the U.S. than vice versa. Mr. Trump shared none of his predecessors' affection for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. His threats to abandon the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and even the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization weren't hollow. He proved this with unilateral tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement looks a lot like the old one. Mexico's only significant concession was on autos and parts: Rules require more North American production, higher wages and potential tariffs if exports to the U.S. exceed 2.6 million vehicles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet these auto rules may have little practical significance. Jeff Schuster, of consulting firm LMC Automotive, says some lower-priced models assembled in Mexico by Volkswagen, Mazda and other manufacturers may no longer qualify for duty-free entry. Rather than shift production to the U.S., they may simply pay the 2.5% tariff, he says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from expanding capacity in Mexico but won't affect current shipments, since U.S. auto demand has stagnated. Canada also faces an export cap, but it is far above current exports and thus even less likely to bind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once the U.S. had a deal with Mexico, it urged Canada to sign on or be left out. But Canadian negotiators, who have a reputation for intransigence dating back to the original 1988 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the U.S., didn't capitulate. Canada also had cultivated allies among U.S. governors, senators, congressmen and business groups.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ron Johnson, Republican senator from Wisconsin, says he made the case to Mr. Trump's advisers for a deal including Canada, not just Mexico. He says he told them what \"businesses on the ground were experiencing because of the steel and aluminum tariffs, and what would happen if we weren't able to continue a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone in North America.\" Wisconsin farmers were upset last year when Canada blocked imports of their ultrafiltered milk. Mr. Johnson said Canada's ambassador reached out to Canadian-owned processors in Wisconsin who bought the milk, saving those farmers from lost sales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had U.S. negotiators proceeded without Canada, there was a real risk that Congress wouldn't ratify an agreement with only Mexico, particularly if Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in November.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How that risk affected the outcome is unclear. Canada did end up making an important concession by expanding U.S. access to its heavily protected dairy market. The U.S. gave imports more access to its protected peanut-butter and sugar markets. So this is a genuine victory for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that benefits consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Canada succeeded in preserving binational panels that can overrule U.S. decisions to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties. That was a notable concession by U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer, who as a private lawyer representing companies seeking protection, had suffered a reversal at the hands of such a panel and long complained that they infringe on U.S. sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The outcome has important lessons for future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations. Mr. Trump will soon be negotiating with Japan and the EU over steel and autos. Yet his leverage will be constrained by pressure from exporters and businesses in the U.S. that stand to lose from higher costs at home and retaliation abroad, and consequently resistance from Congress. Mr. Trump's threats to upend the WTO are likely to meet even more resistance from Congress than his threats to scrap <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometime next year Mr. Trump will have to get Congress to approve the USMCA. He may then find himself extolling the sorts of deals he has long disparaged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "398802964.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Clinton's Sugar Daddy Games Now Threaten Nafta's Future</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In her testimony to the grand jury Monica Lewinsky offered an interesting aside: In the middle of a \"meeting\" with her, Bill Clinton took a phone call from Florida sugar baron Alfonso Fanjul.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That little detail didn't make the tabloids but it raised eyebrows among free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advocates. The easy access to an otherwise engaged president reaffirmed the suspicion that sugar growers -- who keep Washington sweetened with their political giving -- had disproportionate influence in the Oval Office. In 1999 Mr. Fanjul raked up a million dollars for Mr. Clinton's party at a fundraiser on his estate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Fanjul call came to mind in early December when Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu accused the Bush administration of promoting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in sugar with Mexico. The claim helped her rally the highly-protected Louisiana sugar industry and allowed her to squeeze past her Republican opponent in a runoff Senate race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sugar issue was quickly relegated to footnote status by the press. Yet it has implications that go well beyond the artificially high price of sugar that American consumers have to eat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Landrieu and her sugar constituents want no less than a renegotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which has expanded U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to the tune of $350 billion annually and holds promise for future growth and prosperity. Whether the U.S. gives the sugar lobby what it wants is really about whether it will stick to its pledge to fully open the U.S. market and therefore maintain the moral authority to hold Mexico to its promise to do the same.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course Ms. Landrieu doesn't want less access to other imported goods for Louisiana. During the campaign she denounced the new Bush steel tariffs because access to high quality, low-priced steel is so vital to that state's economy. She merely wants special protection for the sugar lobby. But if that is granted why should any of the other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> components continue to hold?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not surprisingly, the Clinton administration's close relationship with sugar producers and Ms. Landrieu's eleventh hour election promise to defend them are related. To understand just how it's necessary to go back in time to the period between the signing of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1992 and its ratification by Congress in 1993. It was then that the U.S. sugar industry began kicking up a storm about the opening of its notoriously protected market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks began Mexico and the U.S. agreed that the whole economy had to be on the table. \"Otherwise, each side would begin picking and choosing what it wanted to protect and the agreement would be full of exceptions,\" says one former Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. That meant, of course, that the U.S. sugar market had to be opened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> says that in 2008 all sugar tariffs and duties will disappear. The agreement signed in 1992 said that from implementation until the full 2008 opening, duty-free quotas in sugar would grow annually and tariff rates for amounts over those quotas would come down gradually.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1992 Mexico was a net importer of sugar. But the 1992 agreement said that if Mexico was able to generate sugar surpluses over and above its domestic consumption for two years in a row, it would be allowed to export those surpluses duty-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That opened a preliminary to the main bout. Mexico now produces surplus sugar and wants to export it. But the U.S. says that between the time <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was signed and when it was ratified, it signed a \"side letter\" with Mexico, which put new limits on sugar exports to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That \"side letter\" says that Mexico can export surplus sugar to the U.S. only after it reduces what is considered a \"surplus\" by the amount of high-fructose corn syrup that it consumes. Since under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico imports and consumes large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup from the U.S., the amount of surplus sugar that qualifies for duty-free export under the U.S. side letter drops precipitously. The letter also caps duty-free Mexican sugar at 250,000 metric tons per year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increase in Mexican sugar production was predictable. To understand why, it's important to remember that U.S. price supports in sugar are maintained through the use of high tariffs. That meant that if Mexico was going to have open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the U.S. its tariffs had to be the same as U.S. tariffs. In other words, North America had to form a customs union with a common external tariff on sugar. This raised the price of sugar in Mexico, creating an incentive to produce more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Mexican industry gained <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> access to high-fructose corn syrup from the U.S. and began using it in many products instead of sugar. The net effect was that while there was more sugar produced in Mexico, consumption did not go up as much. That's how Mexico managed to become a net exporter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. sugar producers saw this coming and threatened to block <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ratification. To overcome their objections the Clinton administration's U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Mickey Kantor drafted the side letter. The U.S.T.R. says it stands by the letter. But Mexico's claim that it never signed anything so ridiculous sounds plausible. It looks more like Mr. Kantor was trying to pull a fast one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last year the Mexican congress slapped a 20% import tariff on U.S. high-fructose corn syrup as retaliation for U.S. sugar protection. That's harming a whole line of U.S. producers of corn-based products, along with Mexican consumers. Sen. Charles Grassley, and seven other Corn Belt senators are raising cane about this with President Bush. But they should be going after their colleagues protecting sugar.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are rumors that the U.S. sugar industry is trying not only to force Mexico to accept the terms of the disputed letter but is also pressuring the U.S. to renege on the full opening in 2008. The U.S.T.R. may be trying to find a compromise, knowing that if sugar doesn't get what it wants it will seek anti-dumping relief that could mean sharply higher tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The power of organized domestic producers to win protection is legendary. Yet modern statesmen recognize the need for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> leadership in the interest of reducing third-world poverty and increasing global stability. Ms. Landrieu's retrograde protectionism may have seemed sweet on election day but it is bad for world health.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2095117004.xml", "text": "<h2>ANALYSIS; NAFTA with no Canada? Is Trump bluffing?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Canada returned to the bargaining table Tuesday to renegotiate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, hanging over the talks was President Trump's ominous vow: If Ottawa doesn't bend to U.S. demands, he'll lock up a pact with Mexico alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether Trump meant it or not, it won't be that easy. More likely his threat is a bluff because there are significant -- some say insurmountable -- legal constraints and political hurdles to replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with one or two bilateral accords.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the uncertainty of whether Mexico would even sign an agreement without Canada -- Mexican officials gave mixed signals about that -- practically no one thinks cutting out Canada is a good idea economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was designed as a three-way deal to integrate the North American region and create a powerful economic bloc and market. Breaking that up into one or two bilateral deals would create significant disruptions and undercut the supply chains and efficiencies that have been built up over a quarter of a century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has made North America a powerhouse, and the only way we can compete for global markets with Asian and European producers is to maintain and strengthen the entire North American production base,\" said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Council, a business advocacy group.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Trump announced Monday that his administration had a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada out in the cold, lawyers and congressional leaders have also questioned whether the president has the legal authority to do so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one thing, forging a separate bilateral agreement is expected to be accompanied by Trump's termination of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- and it's far from clear that the president has the authority to unilaterally dissolve the pact. Some experts say that power ultimately rests with Congress, which approved the agreement in 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the existing \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" that gives the president more leeway in pushing a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> through Congress wouldn't apply to a separate two-country pact. That means Trump probably would need another congressional action to sign and submit a U.S.-Mexico agreement for ratification -- and that will almost certainly stir up a huge political fight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think Congress is going to be a bulwark against the possibility of massive chaos and uncertainty by the Trump administration's move on the chessboard,\" said Claire Reade, a former assistant U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, referring to any effort to break <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into pieces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Getting anything through Congress, particularly if Democrats take control of the House in November, will be all that much harder for Trump. Even Republicans don't like abandoning the trilateral agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think there are technical problems with that, and so my hope is that Canada comes on board rather quickly,\" the Republican whip, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters Tuesday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's ultimatum to Canada partly reflected his preference for bilateral deals and his hardball negotiating style. But it was also a recognition that unless Canada agrees to a revamped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in a matter of days, it could result in new challenges and more delays in completing a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's because a new president in Mexico will take office Dec. 1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Allowing the current Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to sign a deal would provide political cover for the incoming leader, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, since he would not be directly tied to any concessions made to Trump. The U.S. needs to notify Congress of a deal Friday, preferably including Canada, in order to meet a 90-day congressional procedural requirement before the countries can formally sign a deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The incoming administration [in Mexico] would like to have the current president basically approve it before he gets into office. But all of them have been consulted,\" Cornyn said. \"And I hope we can get this done. And I hope Canada is on board. Because that would eliminate some of the technical procedural problems.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Tuesday that he saw a three-way agreement coming together this week, which would make the potential bilateral problem moot. But he told CNBC that if there isn't a deal with Canada, \"we'll move forward with Mexico and then we'll reach a separate agreement with Canada.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others were not optimistic about a quick settlement between the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think you might have to start the process all over again,\" said a Washington <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of client sensitivities, referring to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion requirement and 90-day notification requirement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several thorny unresolved issues between Canada and the United States. Both Canada and Mexico strongly objected to a U.S. proposal for a so-called sunset clause that would automatically dissolve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> after five years unless all the parties agreed to renew it. In the end, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to allow a revamped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s term to be extended to 16 years, but every six years the parties could still bring up issues for negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sunset provision won't fly with Canadian officials, said Eric Miller, president of the consulting firm Rideau Potomac Strategy Group and advisor to the Canadian government on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> affairs. The U.S. and Canada also will be wrangling over Trump's personal oft-cited grievance: Canada's 300% tariff on milk imports and overall protected dairy market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Trying to unwind that in a week is very, very difficult,\" he said. Like American sugar and agricultural sectors, he said, \"dairy farmers are a very powerful lobby\" in Canada. And Trump, who is not popular in Canada, has not made it easy for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cave in without risking significant political costs with his domestic constituents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miller, who is monitoring the talks, said Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, arrived in Washington with her negotiating team, and they were meeting with U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer and others into late Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, analysts said Mexico was holding the trilateral talks together, but it's unclear what it will do if the U.S. and Canada can't come to terms fairly quickly. Mexican officials may have a hard time selling a U.S.-Mexico-only deal to a public that will be skeptical about an agreement that Canada has balked at.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexicans may have to decide: Are they going to stand with the Canadians or are they going to throw them under the bus?\" said William Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts, Reinsch said it was imperative that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> remain a three-way pact, to preserve the gains and advantages of the large free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone. Reinsch said, for example, that car companies, which account for a big chunk of the three-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, have supply chains that cross both borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the preliminary deal between the U.S. and Mexico included some notable changes aimed at increasing use of suppliers in North America and giving producers in the region an edge over rivals in Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Reinsch said that if the U.S. has separate rules for Canada and Mexico, \"it will force [companies] to revise their supply chains to conform to two conflicting standards.\" And that, \"at a minimum will cost them time and money,\" he said. \"And it will lead to a more expensive product and less competitive industry.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>don.lee@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

But the problems he railed about are real.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Kingsbury, acting editorial page editor, wrote about the editorial board's verdict on Donald Trump's presidency in a special edition of our Opinion Today newsletter. You can   read it here  .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump presidency has been such a five-alarm fire that many people are understandably consumed with trying to put out the flames or simply survive it. But there will come a day, hopefully in the not too distant future, when people have the breathing room to investigate how the fire got started.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to heap scorn and blame on President Trump's millions of enthusiastic supporters. Without their adoration, he wouldn't have been able to do the damage he has done. But there are good reasons to refrain. Calling large swaths of the American electorate deplorable turns out to be an ineffective way to gain their backing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another reason: The mess the nation faces is bigger than Donald Trump. If he is voted out in November, the people who cast ballots for him will remain, pining for the policies he promoted. About 40 percent of American voters want tariffs and a border wall. More than half say it's important to deport more undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much ink has been spilled about whether Trump supporters voted for him out of economic anxiety or racial anxiety, with plenty of studies concluding the latter. But spend time at a dying factory and you might see how difficult it can be to disentangle the two.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the past four years, I've followed a group of steelworkers in Indiana -- men and women, Black and white -- who had worked at a factory that moved to Mexico. I watched them agonize about whether to train their Mexican replacements, or stand with their union and refuse. I watched them grieve the plant like a parent. I followed them as they applied for new jobs, some of which paid half as much as they made before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A machinist named Tim carried his steelworker union card in his wallet for years after the factory closed, just to remind himself who he was. Tim grew up in a union household. His dad had been an autoworker; his grandfather, a coal miner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We always voted Democrat because they looked after the little man,\" Tim told me. \"My father went to his grave and I can guarantee you he never voted for a Republican.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim had such faith in Democrats that he didn't worry when President Bill Clinton pushed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement over the finish line in 1993. Nor did he worry when Mr. Clinton normalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China in 2000. But then the factory where Tim worked moved to Shanghai. And the next one moved to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time I met Tim, he loathed the Clintons and the Democratic Party. Democrats had gotten in bed with the corporations, while no one was looking. Tim felt betrayed, and politically abandoned -- until Mr. Trump came along.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>College-educated people scoffed at Mr. Trump's promises to bring back the factories. The factories are never coming back, they insisted. But even false hope is a form of hope, perhaps the most ubiquitous kind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is little doubt that Mr. Trump is president today because of blue-collar people like Tim who were once a reliable pillar of the Democratic Party. About 55 percent of voters who expected to support Mr. Trump during the 2016 primaries identified as working class, according to a 2015 study by the Public Religion Research Institute. Fewer than a third who backed other Republican candidates identified as such.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mahoning County, Ohio, more than a quarter of people who voted in the Republican primary were ex-Democrats, according to The Washington Post. Eighteen members of the county's Democratic central committee crossed over to cast ballots for Mr. Trump, the county's Democratic chairman told The Post.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those defections stemmed in part from anger over millions of factory jobs that went to China in the 2000s. Workers who made instrument panels for G.M. trucks in Michigan, stitched shirts in Pennsylvania and sanded wooden dressers in North Carolina saw alarming increases in child poverty, single motherhood, deaths from alcohol and drugs and reliance on public assistance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exposure to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China led to \"sizable increases in the likelihood of G.O.P. victory in majority-white non-Hispanic congressional districts from 2002-2010,\" said a study co-written by David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hillary Clinton would have won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- and thus the presidency -- in 2016 had the economic blow of imports from China been half as big, the report concluded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is worth noting that many of those same counties that hemorrhaged factory jobs also saw large increases in undocumented immigrants competing for the unskilled jobs that remained -- cleaning hotel rooms, slaughtering chickens and mowing lawns. Their arrival fueled still more resentment of the world beyond America's borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anger about globalization is not confined to the right. It fueled the rise of Bernie Sanders, who won the endorsement of the steelworkers I followed. The same week I met Tim, I interviewed an anarchist facing criminal charges for his role in the disruption of Mr. Trump's inauguration when windows were smashed and a limousine was set on fire. Why had he became an anarchist? <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the tyranny of global capitalism, he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To many, that anger can seem silly or misplaced. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and globalization have undoubtedly made the country richer. But those riches have flowed disproportionately to the few with capital and education, while globalization's downsides have piled on the shoulders of the most vulnerable Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has come to symbolize a world order crafted by elites, for elites. The deal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d away blue-collar factory jobs in exchange for white-collar opportunities to invest in Mexico's banking and insurance sectors. Today, even its biggest supporters admit that it resulted in a net loss of American jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hindsight, it seems inevitable that globalization would cause a backlash. During the height of euphoria about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the 1990s, the philosopher Richard Rorty predicted that workers \"will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported.\" At that point, he wrote, parts of the electorate \"will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for -- someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In countries from Britain to Brazil, voters have elected leaders who promised to reverse decades of international economic integration. Most of those populist movements are right wing. The rebellion against free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and globalization has largely taken the left by surprise. Dani Rodrik, an economics professor at Harvard who is perhaps the country's most prominent skeptic of unfettered globalization, lamented in an article a few months before Mr. Trump's election that left-wing parties around the world had failed to present viable alternatives to protectionism and walls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, the landscape has changed. Joe Biden, who once whole-heartedly embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, acknowledges the harm it's inflicted on the working class. Mr. Biden's economic plan includes a 10 percent tax on businesses that send manufacturing offshore, and a 10 percent tax credit for companies that bolster job growth inside the United States. He has also put forth a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years on green energy infrastructure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Biden, the nominally centrist candidate, has a platform that is far more progressive than Hillary Clinton's on economics,\" Mr. Rodrik told me in an email. \"But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we will see whether Biden will deliver real change if elected.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans who longed for a strongman will vote for Mr. Trump again. They revere him for tearing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> (even if the new version looks an awful lot like the old one) and slapping tariffs on Chinese imports and Korean washing machines (even if his unpredictable <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war forced the deepest contraction in the manufacturing sector in a decade).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, working-class voters who look a little deeper will notice something strange about their perceived champion: He is against unions. His first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, helped erode the ability of unions to collect dues and fees in a landmark case. Another strange thing: The Trump administration's interim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with China focuses far more on opening up the Chinese banking and insurance sectors than on creating blue-collar jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut favored corporations and shareholders -- including those who aren't American citizens. Money that would have flowed into the U.S. Treasury went instead into their pockets and deep bank accounts. The companies used much of it to buy back their own stock, making their owners richer, instead of hiring and training new workers or increasing pay. The buybacks were so shameless that even Mr. Trump couldn't defend them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We thought they would have known better,\" he told reporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump is the one who should have known better. He's either incompetent or he's a Trojan horse who used blue-collar workers to get into the White House, only to hand over the keys to the one percent. Now that the Trump administration is trying to kill the Affordable Care Act, which millions of people depend on in the middle of a pandemic, it could not be more clear whose side he is on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Health care is one of the things that sent Shannon, a steelworker I followed in Indiana, back to the Democrats, even though most people in her family still support Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He's bragging that he's saving all these jobs,\" she told me. \"But he's not.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "433186280.xml", "text": "<h2>Lost in the Woods</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawrence Herman is a lawyer in Toronto. Gary Hufbauer is a senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continues her talks in Ottawa today, she may find that the most acrimonious disagreement between Canada and the United States is not a question of hard power -- issues like Afghanistan, Iraq and nuclear nonproliferation -- but of softwood. A quarter-century-old dispute over Canadian lumber exports, which Washington claims are unfairly subsidized, has escalated to the point where it now threatens broader relations between the two countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it remains unresolved, the softwood war might also spill over into the December ministerial meeting of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization, where Washington and Ottawa have long worked together to expand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. What kind of example does it set for the rest of the world if the United States and Canada -- close neighbors, each other's largest trading partner and crucial allies -- cannot resolve their own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American and Canadian lawyers, lobbyists and negotiators have been fighting on and off over Canadian lumber exports to the United States since the 1980's. In 1982, a coalition of 250 American lumber mills claimed that Canadian provinces were subsidizing lumber exports by charging set ''stumpage fees'' -- the price forest companies paid when harvesting standing timber -- while American mills were paying open market prices. While the fight over things like stumpage fees is complex enough, it got a sharp twist in 2000 when Congress passed an amendment giving American companies injured by foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> the punitive duties imposed by the United States, which in the case of Canadian lumber exports now amount to about $5 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that the right of the United States to impose such duties is in dispute, or that the W.T.O. declared the Byrd amendment (named after its creator, Senator Robert C. Byrd) illegal. American and Canadian officials now face two lumber disputes: the old one about timber management practices; and the new one about who owns the money held by the Treasury. Making things uglier are conflicting decisions by a panel convened under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and by the W.T.O., with the United States claiming that favorable rulings by the latter trump adverse rulings by the former.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canadians, including the normally friendly Canadian business community, are particularly outraged that Washington has rejected the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel decision. In Canadian eyes, this refusal by the United States betrays the central deal that underpinned <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the first place: Canada allowed unfettered access to its energy resources and an end to restrictions on American investment in return for a binding method of settling disputes. As Prime Minister Paul Martin made clear recently, the dispute is coloring everything from the oil and gas <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy to the United States) to cooperation in the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Canada and the United States cannot bring their common heritage and collective ingenuity to resolve the lumber dispute, little hope remains for commercial differences in other areas, or in other parts of the world. With this in mind, we have two suggestions, one to dispose of the $5 billion pot held by the American Treasury, the other to bridge the ancient battle over lumber exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the $5 billion. We recommend that a bilateral trust should administer the funds for the benefit of the North American industry as a whole. Representatives of Canadian and American lumber companies, and the two governments, would manage the trust. Possible projects: scientific research, pest control, forest fire control and re-structuring assistance, especially for smaller mills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, we believe that President Bush and Prime Minister Martin should each appoint a special envoy with the authority to negotiate a final and durable compromise by a date certain, say June 2006. The idea is to elevate the issue to the highest level, removing it from the present negotiating framework where vested interests exercise far too much influence. We have in mind envoys of the stature of James Baker from the United States and Derek Burney from Canada, who brokered the original Canada-United States free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal in the 1980's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These envoys would be charged with specific instructions: agree on limits on the Canadian share of the American lumber market that would gradually expand over time; settle the terms for market-based adjustments to the Canadian stumpage system while making provisions for the environment; and hammer out the details for managing the $5 billion pot. As part of the package, all legal actions would be halted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two heads of government should commit in advance to backing whatever agreement their envoys reach within these overall terms. The grand bargain that was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be returned to pride of place in our relations. Not only would this restore confidence in the strength of the North American partnership, it would strengthen both countries' efforts to promote free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> worldwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Joseph Hart)</p>\n"}
{"id": "398535615.xml", "text": "<h2>The last straw</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to sympathize with the oft-heard complaint of Latin Americans that the U.S. is interested in free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> only so long as it is Americans who benefit. Just consider Washington's latest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dispute with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Earlier this month, the Administration increased to 33% from 22% the tariff on imports of ordinary straw brooms from Mexico, citing the Emergency Action Chapter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This decision is yet another indication -- add it to U.S. protectionism against Mexican tomatoes, avocados and trucking -- that the spirit of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is perennially at risk due to the power of special interest groups. In this case, the U.S. Cornbroom Task Force, an industry group, argued that the tiny Mexican corn broom industry was injuring the even tinier U.S. corn broom industry -- even though broomcorn, a kind of sorghum, apparently isn't profitable enough to be grown in this country anymore. American broom makers import it from -- guess where? -- Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico exports only about $7 million in corn brooms to the U.S. each year, which made it tough for the large broom industry here to argue that it had suffered an injury. In order to get around this inconvenient fact, the U.S. broom industry, which makes both plastic and corn brooms, argued that corn brooms are a separate industry from plastic brooms. Since U.S. broom makers have moved heavily toward plastic in recent years, a snapshot of the corn broom segment of the market produces the image of a Mexican corn broom industry of 2,500 workers swallowing up a small, shrinking industry of 600 American workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cause of the American corn broom makers is helped by language in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> specifying that tariffs can be restored if American broom makers suffer. This was engineered by Democratic Rep. Glenn Poshard of Illinois, home of Arcola, the self-styled \"Broomcorn Capital of the World,\" where no broomcorn has grown for 20 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican corn broom industry is centered mostly in a poor region of the state of Nuevo Leon not far from the U.S. border. While the U.S. frets about Mexican job-seekers sneaking into California and Texas, lends billions of dollars in emergency funding to Mexico, and supports a variety of aid agencies whose objective is to end poverty there, it is ironic that it also suffocates competitive local businesses that wish to sell their wares in the U.S. With this ruling, Mexican producers will have less opportunity and U.S. consumers will pay more for brooms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, once a proud peacock representing the future of freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on this continent, is slowly having its plumes plucked. The concept of comparative advantage -- the heart and soul of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> theory -- appears to be completely lost on the managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs in Washington. Every time it looks like a Mexican industry might have an edge over its U.S. counterpart, Washington cries foul and finds a way to up the tariff and save an antiquated industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The broom tariff was the last straw for Mexico. After battling for many months against U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that boosted the price of Mexican tomatoes, blocked the export of avocados and kept Mexican trucks from crossing the border, Mexico sent a message to Washington earlier this month that it had had enough. It boosted tariffs on eight U.S. products, including notebooks, wine coolers, brandy and Tennessee whiskey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economically speaking, retaliation doesn't make sense -- Mexicans don't win if children have to pay a premium for notebooks or grownups shell out more for a cocktail. Yet it's an indication of just how frustrated our southern neighbor is. Instead of bullying our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partner, the U.S. should lead the way in free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, thereby helping U.S. consumers, Mexican workers and, yes, American workers as well. It's true that some corn broom makers may be forced to seek other work, but in the long run it is to the advantage of the U.S. to produce things for which it has a comparative advantage. Wrapping wire around straw is not where the future of the American economy lies.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2062740122.xml", "text": "<h2>A Left Turn in Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico entered a brave old world on Sunday by electing former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a six-year term as president. The 64-year-old left-wing populist has lost twice, in 2006 and 2012, but this time he won against two weak candidates while promising more moderate policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official vote count wasn't available late Sunday evening, but exit polls gave Mr. Lopez Obrador a large enough margin to call him the winner. Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) is expected to finish a distant second with Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Jose Antonio Meade in third. Early indications suggest the president-elect's coattails will make his Morena front, which includes smaller parties, the largest coalition in both legislative chambers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campaign was marred by violence at the local level. But kudos to Mexico's National Electoral Institute, which handled 157,000 polling stations and some nine million more registered voters than in 2012. The largely peaceful vote is another milestone in Mexico's progress as a democracy since the days when Mr. Lopez Obrador worked for the PRI that ran the country as a one-party state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO, as Mr. Lopez Obrador is known, is a career politician from the oil-rich southern state of Tabasco. But in this race he ran as an outsider, pledging to end corruption, upend the establishment in politics and economics -- which he called \"mafias of power\" -- and use subsidies to lift the poor, especially in rural areas. He said he would make Mexicans better off by assigning the state a larger role in the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO has moderated his rhetoric from the decades when he railed against private investment in energy and other economic competition as Mexico shifted toward free markets. But his Morena party, which he founded in 2014, is home to many who are nostalgic for the not-so-glorious days of PRI dominance. They have never accepted the country's transition to an open economy with more political and institutional transparency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lopez Obrador's challenge will be keeping those supporters happy without derailing Mexico's economic progress under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Except for some of Mexico's crony capitalists, entrepreneurial Mexico largely opposed his candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most extreme fear is that AMLO will attempt to consolidate power a la Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. But Mexico has made considerable economic and political progress in 30 years of reform presidencies. The Mexican government doesn't hold the oil power that Chavez had, and a Mexican president is constrained by his country's obligations under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- unless President Trump tears it up. Financial markets will also vote on AMLO's government each day through foreign-exchange markets and the value of the peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. can help by completing a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal as soon as possible. Mr. Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric played into the hands of Mr. Lopez Obrador's left-wing nationalism, but troubles in Mexico will inevitably spill across the border -- wall or no wall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO's anti-corruption pledge will also be tested by how he handles the country's already weak rule of law. He has said he will amnesty drug traffickers and not investigate corrupt politicians for past crimes. His government's cooperation with the U.S. on regional drug and immigration enforcement will also be important to watch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This election has dramatically altered Mexican politics. The once-dominant PRI is now a minor party. Its losses are a repudiation of current President Enrique Pena Nieto's government. The center-right PAN is now the largest opposition party in Congress, but it too is weakened and will have to rebuild after divisive internal battles that undermined Mr. Anaya's candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some 30% of registered voters were millennials, who have no memory of the one-party state of Mr. Lopez Obrador's youth. They are dissatisfied with Mexico's status quo and have voted for a change. Let's hope the change they get isn't back to the future of state economic control and peso devaluation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

U.S. overall exports to the Caribbean have expanded by more than 100%, and Caribbean exports to the U.S. have climbed by roughly 50%. By the end of 1994, combined U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> stood at $24 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 24 nations of the Caribbean Basin -- among them Jamaica, Trinidad, the Dominican Republic and all Central American countries -- have enjoyed these strong economic and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations during the past dozen years largely through the mechanism of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). But recent changes in U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law have put the long-term viability of this relationship in jeopardy. Under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, for example, Mexican exports now enjoy access to the U.S. market exceeding that accorded to Caribbean exports. The General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> implementing act has exacerbated these effects by phasing out a program that regulated the importation of textile and apparel products from all countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, Caribbean countries are now forced to compete in their largest market at a substantial competitive disadvantage. In the two years that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect, there has been a steady diversion of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment away from the Caribbean Basin nations. In the textile and apparel sector alone, Mexico has displaced other Caribbean countries. It is now the single largest source of U.S. garment imports from this hemisphere. Such diversion has begun to erode U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations, weakening the employment base of hundreds of thousands of Americans who depend upon strong U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit with Central American leaders last month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced that President Clinton will include in his fiscal year 1997 budget request a key proposal to strengthen U.S.-Caribbean Basin economic relations. Coming on the heels of Cuba shooting down two unarmed civilian planes, Mr. Christopher's announcement underscores the compelling U.S. national and security interests in maintaining strong economic links with the Caribbean region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary Christopher's announcement advances a bipartisan proposal currently before the Congress that will correct the unintended adverse effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the Caribbean Basin. The prospect of enhanced U.S.-Caribbean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links enjoys widespread support, and has been endorsed by many Caribbean heads of government and countless business and community leaders, both in the U.S. and in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As currently envisioned, the proposal will insure that Caribbean and Mexican exports enjoy equal access to the U.S. market during the next 10 years. During this transitional period of \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity,\" Caribbean countries will be required to take reciprocal steps to expand market access for U.S. products, strengthen investment guarantees, expand worker's rights, and improve intellectual property protection. By the end of the 10-year period, the U.S. will have strengthened its commercial relationship with the Caribbean region while the CBI countries will be in a better position to join a hemispheric-wide Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity would be felt strongly over the next few years in both the Caribbean and in the U.S. Presently, the U.S.-Caribbean commercial relationship supports more than 260,000 jobs in the U.S. and countless more throughout the Caribbean. The Caribbean Basin is now the 10th-largest export market for the U.S. and one of the few regions in the world where U.S. exporters maintain <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will build on this framework as elevated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> levels generate thousands of new jobs each year in the U.S. and the Caribbean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits to U.S. industry for this program are clear as well. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will enhance international competitiveness of the U.S. textile and apparel industry by building on the productive relationship already enjoyed by U.S. and Caribbean firms. Since Caribbean garment exports rely upon U.S. components and labor for as much as 70% of their value-added, any expansion of the Caribbean garment industry directly benefits U.S. firms and workers. Many Caribbean governments already operate programs that successfully fight illegal textile transhipment from East and South Asian countries, so <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity will strengthen a framework that protects the domestic industry from quota violations. Finally, as Caribbean governments take steps to strengthen intellectual property and investment protections -- as Jamaica has already done -- many other U.S. industries will gain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This trading relationship means that overall economic growth and development in the Caribbean Basin can directly translate into expanded export opportunities for the U.S. Roughly 60 cents of each dollar the region earns from exports to the U.S. market is spent in the U.S. buying American-made consumer goods, food products, raw materials and capital equipment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this context, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity has emerged as a cost-effective economic and foreign policy instrument to promote regional development. Increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> activity will provide many additional commercial opportunities, which are so crucial for healthy economic growth in cities and rural areas throughout the U.S. Stronger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> links will inevitably lead to better cooperation in other areas, such as narcotics interdiction, anticorruption activities, and efforts to fight terrorism and international crime. Moreover, as Caribbean economies prosper, they will become less dependent on U.S. foreign aid at a time when foreign assistance is getting close scrutiny. In many ways, therefore, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity represents a tangible \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not aid\" approach, which has taken on new importance in light of the U.S. budget debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Numerous studies have shown that strong regional economic links are crucial not only in creating economic opportunities throughout the U.S. and the Caribbean Basin but also in supporting stable and mutually beneficial security relationships. Congress should advance U.S. national security interests in the region by moving quickly to enact <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bernal is Jamaica's ambassador to the U.S. and Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States.</p>\n"}

S. presidents, the majority of House and Senate members (including Bob Dole) and legions of academic economists, bankers and multinationals all swore to the contrary: The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they promised, would be a \"win-win\" for American and Mexican workers. They ridiculed those who held any lesser view, particularly Ross Perot and his \"sucking sound\" of jobs going south.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, all policies face their hour of accountability. In the case of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it is taking the form of bills by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kaptur represents the industrial Toledo area, which has suffered massive plant shutdowns and the loss of a great many of those jobs to Mexico. The Almanac of American Politics calls her \"probably Congress' most vocal and dedicated opponent of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" and when Bill Clinton's campaign train rumbled through the Rust Belt on the way to the Democratic convention, Kaptur was out front giving the president hell.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Congress returned from its convention break, Kaptur's bill, called the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Accountability Act, already had 108 cosponsors. Basically, it points out that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was passed on promises to the American people that it would increase their (and Mexicans') standard of living, reduce illegal immigration, improve environmental and health conditions on the border and slow the drug <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Now it is time to assess results. The bill would require the administration to certify that these goals have been achieved. If they haven't, then the U.S. must renegotiate or withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal is sending shock waves through the ranks of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporters who realize that such an audit would probably not pass muster. In fact, there is sufficient data showing that economic, immigration, drug trafficking and environmental conditions on both sides of the border have deteriorated, not improved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proponents of the Kaptur and Dorgan bills are pressing for the following promise/reality check:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will create American jobs. Before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s implementation, the U.S. had a positive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with Mexico of $1.7 billion. In 1995, two years after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. was running a net <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit of $15 billion. Since every $1 billion of exports or imports creates or destroys about 23,000 jobs, one can see that the U. S. has suffered a direct net job loss of approximately 391,000 jobs. An indication of this loss is evidenced by the 43,000 displaced workers who have already been certified to receive dislocation benefits under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Adjustment Relief Act, the government's program for workers whose jobs have been lost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another indicator lies in the figures for the Big Three automakers' exports to Mexico, which rose to a meager 19,000 cars and trucks in 1995, while imports of vehicles made in Mexico topped out at 495,674.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Environmental problems along the border will improve. Proponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> felt sure that much of the manufacturing being done in existing border free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zones, or maquiladoras, would move to the interior of Mexico, thus reducing environmental pressures on the border. However, the Mexican Commerce Ministry reported last January that the maquiladora work force actually grew 26% in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s first two years, from 546,588 to 742,700.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will reduce illegal immigration. The thesis here was that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would so improve the standard of living in Mexico that Mexican workers would no longer want to come to the U.S. The opposite has happened: Economic mismanagement and the resulting chaos have driven many thousands of desperate Mexicans north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kaptur and Dorgan bills seek to assess this reality gap. They call for the president to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with any of the other parties exceeds 10% of U.S. exports to that country. They direct the president to mitigate any adverse effect of rapid changes in currency exchange rates, as has happened with the peso. They direct the president to renegotiate the terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for agricultural commodities. They require certification of gains in U. S. jobs and living standards attributable to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; certification that conditions affecting public health have improved along the U.S.-Mexican border; and certification that human and political rights are respected and that increased imports do not result in increased importation of drugs. Finally, they bar expansion of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> until these conditions are met. And if they are not, the U.S. is to renegotiate or withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a good bet that both the Kaptur and Dorgan bills will pass and an equally good bet that the president will never be able to certify compliance. The end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? The first major challenge to U.S. free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> philosophy?

This is the least-examined chapter of his career. But suddenly it all makes sense: Where else but in medicine do you find men and women who never admit a mistake? Who talk more than they listen, and feel entitled to withhold crucial information? Whose lack of tact in matters of life and death might disqualify them for any other field?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, I've spent almost two decades observing politicians, whom on balance I quite like, and more recent years observing doctors, who . . . . Well, let's just say that mine is a grudge tenderly nurtured over two and a half years of illness, encompassing roughly 32 doctors in six hospitals, plus scores of the medical students, fellows, interns and residents in whom we can see the doctor in larval form.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A doctor who has told you one thing at Appointment A might propose an entirely different course of action at Meeting B. Fair enough -- except for the pretense that nothing has changed. It is the very rare doctor who will say, \"I've changed my mind,\" or, \"Sorry, I was wrong when I said X at our last meeting.\" Usually, what he said last time has simply become . . . inoperative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now let's turn the clock back to September, and watch Dean answer George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" about his 180-degree turn, over the years, on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GS: \"On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, you used to be a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HD: \"George, you're doing it again. I supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and wrote a letter to President Clinton in 1992 supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

I didn't march down the street demanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. I simply wrote a letter supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dean was not in the least abashed that he had described himself on the same show, eight years earlier, as \"a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, we patients rarely dare to have such pugnacious dialogue with our doctors. George Stephanopoulos doesn't have to wear one of those demoralizing gowns with all the confusing snaps, and if you're sick you have more important things to do during your tiny portions of face time than bicker with your doctor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(A disclaimer: Naturally, all the doctors who are presently  treating and advising me are paragons of sagacity and compassion, nothing at all like the men and women I am so broadly lampooning. You know who you are.) The odd thing is that most of Dean's unacknowledged shifts in position are of the kind any other half- good politician, with some vaporous wording, could explain away in his sleep. But even when Dean makes what is clearly a blunder, it takes him days to make the apology that a rival campaign would instinctively produce before the next news cycle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings me to the irrationally strong impulse, shared by doctors and politicians, to hoard information. Consider the high- handed way Dean has tried to shield great portions of his gubernatorial records. Similarly, doctors seem bent on ensuring that you not read the runic scribblings they have made in your chart. During one hospital stay, as I sat in a wheelchair outside Radiology waiting to be pushed back to my room, I began idly flipping through my chart. A young female doctor-in-training I had never seen before stopped in front of me and said, \"You know, you really shouldn't be reading your chart.\" I thanked her for her advice and continued reading. She repeated her admonition. I explained that I was 43 and couldn't possibly read anything worse there than I had already been told by five real doctors. Upon which she actually wrested it from my grasp. (From this I learned always to go to a stall in the ladies' room when I want to read my chart.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, let's turn to what newspapers delicately title \"the temperament question.\" Dean's been called arrogant, angry, condescending, prickly. He has gotten this far by playing his chesty irritability as a sign of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I have enough brusque, irritable doctors in my life without sending one to the White House. My most memorable brushes have been with an eminent surgeon whose method is to stride into the examining room two hours late, pat your hand, pronounce your certain death if he can't perform an operation on you, and then snap at your husband to stop taking notes, he can't possibly follow the complexity of the doctor's thinking. Dr. X swats away questions like flies. He spends five precious minutes swearing at the wall-mounted phone, which decades of surgical experience have not equipped him to operate, and then finally pronounces that he can't perform the surgery. \"Unless you want me to. But there's a 50-50 chance I would kill you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why is it, I ask my husband on the way home, that I'm the one who's sick, but they're the ones who are allowed to have the big, operatic personalities?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have the same concern about Dean. Why should Democrats choose to stand around all spring and summer holding their breath against the moment when Dean says something arrogant or impolitic? (Think Southern guys with Confederate flag decals on their pickup trucks.) We're the ones who are supposed to be allowed to go on with our temperamental little lives, while our major-party nominees are the poor chumps who have agreed to adhere to the rigid, Ken-doll theater of politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so I bring to my assessment of this year's Democratic candidates one requirement that never crossed my mind before. First, do no harm.</p>\n"}

For tariffs to raise a lot of money, imports have to stay high.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throw his predictions, then, on the pile of Trump's broken <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promises.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, known as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, wasn't ended, as he claims. It was just given an update and a makeover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Navarro, a top aide to Trump on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, predicted that new tariffs would not lead to any retaliation from other countries. Instead, the European Union, Russia, Turkey, India and China all retaliated \u2014 so much so in the last case that almost all of the revenue from tariffs on Chinese products had to be spent taking care of American farmers who were casualties of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs on Chinese imports might have been worth their costs, retaliation and all, if they had induced the communist regime to end its intellectual property theft, scale back its industrial subsidies or otherwise improve its behavior. The main commitment that Trump won from China was to purchase more American products, especially agricultural ones. China, doubtless in part because of covid, didn't fulfill its end of the bargain. And China's state capitalism remains in place.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tariffs were supposed to boost employment at home by shrinking the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. They didn't. In Trump's last year in office, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was higher than it was in Barack Obama's last year, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the economy. The manufacturing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, an item of special concern for Trump, rose on his watch, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of these results have, however, led to any serious political challenge to Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. Instead, his tariffs have become an item of bipartisan consensus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Biden took office, he surveyed the tariffs' comprehensively disappointing record and \u2026 decided to stick with them. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers on steel and aluminum from Europe, Britain, Japan and elsewhere have been tweaked but not lifted. The tariffs on Chinese imports are still there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's leading potential rival for the Republican nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, voted in line with the rest of the pre-Trump party when he served in the U.S. House, where he helped to pass a bill giving presidents the authority to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Nowadays, he is criticizing the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the naivete of previous U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy toward China. DeSantis has been no more critical of Trump's forays in protectionism than of anything else Trump has done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump, in short, is setting the pace for both parties on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues. That's not because public opinion has turned markedly away from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: Gallup finds that Americans are more likely to consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> an opportunity, and less likely to consider it a threat, than they were 10 years ago. That's especially true among Democrats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden prides himself, however, on maintaining solidarity with labor unions, and they remain keen on restrictions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. He also wants to avoid being called soft on China. Both parties seem to have decided that protectionism appeals to a crucial group of up-for-grabs voters \u2014 White people from industrial states without college degrees \u2014 and is therefore a winning rhetorical stance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't necessarily mean we have a lot more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in our future. Even Trump, who was much more protectionist than his predecessors, didn't follow through on all his bluster. That's why <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which he called the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made by our country, largely survived. Congress almost certainly lacks the votes to pass a major increase in tariffs or to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, and that is unlikely to change in the next election or two. The U.S. economy, judging by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows, is as globalized as ever.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we are not going to see much <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization, either, even as China and others make their own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. The politics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will favor Trump in 2024 \u2014 no matter how little he deserves the advantage.</p>\n"}

Why would Democrats give Mr. Trump a victory? Mr. Lighthizer's Mexico deal is worse than current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in many ways, so the business community is going to be ambivalent at best.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the legal question of whether the President can withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> without Congressional assent.

{"id": "398547163.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA offers Latins little they can't have now</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again the U.S. is flirting with its Latin American trading partners. Last week President Clinton began efforts to win fast-track negotiating authority in Congress, no doubt raising hopes that expansion of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is in the wings. The trouble is that the administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy toward Latin America is highly political and actually harms the cause of freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the effects of the 1994 Miami Summit. By insinuating, suggesting and some would even say, promising that the U.S. would lead efforts to build a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas, the administration created an almost complete paralysis among Latin American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy makers. All around the region, plans to reduce import restrictions further have been shelved and programs to eliminate nontariff barriers postponed as the Latin American countries wait to see if (and when) they would be invited to join the great \"regional integration\" ball.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse yet, in many countries two misguided notions have taken hold. First, that maintaining protection at home would enhance these countries' negotiating position with the U.S., and second, that by forming regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs -- irrespective of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> diversion they may generate -- the grand goal of achieving hemispheric integration would, in the end, be advanced.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even pragmatic Chilean policy makers fell into the trap, and became obsessed with joining the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This in spite of the fact that analysts have been unable to show persuasively that, when compared with other options, joining <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would most benefit the country. And while they waited, they did nothing to further open their economy to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After a series of snubs by the Clinton administration and Congress, however, Chile has recently decided to retake the road that had served the country so well in the past: unilaterally reducing its tariffs. This is a welcome announcement. By further integrating itself into the rest of the world -- import tariffs are supposed to be reduced to 7% in 1997 -- Chile will encourage productivity enhancements and will allow local producers greater access to world technology and capital goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, backtracking on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization in the rest of Latin America continues and is best demonstrated by Brazil's recent decision to severely limit import financing. Brazil's partners in the Mercosur customs union -- Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -- have bitterly complained that this unilateral turn toward protectionism violates the spirit, as well as the letter, of that regional accord. This is a move toward greater protectionism and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the benefits and possibilities available to Brazil -- if it would only continue to open its economy to the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In spite of tremendous progress in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization during the first half of the 1990s, politicians in a number of countries in the region have begun to question the merits of additional opening. In many countries import restrictions have been raised in response to an array of pressures by special interest groups. The recent hike in import tariffs in Colombia, the increase in protectionism in Venezuela and Ecuador, and the use of administrative measures to control imports in Argentina and Mexico are all signs of this trend. Ironically these moves are taking place at a time when the Latin American countries should move aggressively, rapidly and unilaterally toward greater openness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many observers of Latin America believe that the region is already very open to the rest of the world. This is simply not true. In most Latin American nations import tariffs border on 15%. Although this is historically low for the region, it is still very high from an global perspective -- the average U.S. import tariff, for example, is approximately 3%. And most Latin American countries still have significant nontariff barriers. Latin America's relatively high levels of import protectionism have been recognized by some analysts, including Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy of the Heritage Foundation. In their \"The Index of Economic Freedom\" (co-published by this newspaper), not a single Latin American nation is classified as having a \"very low level\" of protectionism, and only a handful are rated as having a \"low level\" of protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more alarming is that the progress that has been made in bringing down some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in Latin America -- and indeed the trend toward greater <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization -- is now at risk.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aside from special-interest politics, two factors have caused this shift in sentiment. First, there is still an important disagreement on whether \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization\" packages have played an important role in the performance of the \"miracle\" economies of East Asia. Some academics, for example, have questioned the premise that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization is a necessary component of successful outward-oriented strategies, and have argued that the Asian Tigers' success has to a large extent depended on an active government role in promoting exports. Existing empirical evidence on the relationship between openness and growth is weak and unpersuasive, these observers allege. Second, in the last few years concern has grown that developing countries' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization may worsen income inequality and social conditions -- particularly hurting unskilled workers. These concerns, however, are largely unfounded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent empirical research based on extensive new comparative data strongly suggests that countries whose economies become more integrated to the rest of the world experience an important boost in productivity growth. Moreover, mounting international evidence suggests that if labor markets are flexible and undistorted -- a requirement not met at this point by most Latin American countries -- major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization reforms will not generate transitional increases in unemployment, as many have feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, a recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank has found that the lack of progress in many Latin American countries on income distribution and other social conditions cannot be attributed to their reform programs, including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization. This confirms previous OECD research suggesting that protectionism may actually increase income inequality in developing nations and that further integration into the world economy will improve social conditions in these countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other countries in the region would do well to follow Chile's lead. By unilaterally opening to the rest of the world, instead of restricting themselves to a small clique of neighbors, the countries of Latin America will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards is a professor of international business at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398947189.xml", "text": "<h2>Trading Places</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Howard Dean recently told the Washington Post that former Democratic Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had advised him he couldn't \"sell\" Dr. Dean to Wall Street if he didn't become more of a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r. Dr. Dean declared this almost as a badge of honor, which illustrates a dangerous economic turn in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had our differences with Bill Clinton, but there's no doubt one of his achievements was leading his party away from protectionism. Open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was a pillar of his New Democrat philosophy. He and Al Gore routed the AFL-CIO and Ross Perot to pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, followed by bills to create the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and allow most-favored nation trading status for China. A decade later all three have contributed to American prosperity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But without a Democrat looking out for the national interest from the Oval Office, the party is now slipping back toward <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> parochialism. On Capitol Hill, the party's regional and union interests have become dominant; most Democrats opposed giving President Bush new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiating authority last year. More ominous still is the rhetoric coming from the Presidential candidates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In demanding that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> be renegotiated, Dr. Dean is hardly alone. With the exception of Senator Joe Lieberman, we can't find any of the other candidates who still supports it. John Kerry attacked Dr. Dean as a protectionist the other day, but the Massachusetts Senator has also said he regrets having voted for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Dr. Dean is also getting whacked from the left for not being protectionist enough: Congressman Dick Gephardt has mocked the fact that Dr. Dean sent Bill Clinton a letter supporting it and showed up for the signing ceremony in 1993, only to walk away from it now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Senator John Edwards is sending out weekly news releases trying to pick a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fight with China. Even Mr. Lieberman, a recognized free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, is trying to show he can also be \"tough\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by joining the Bush Administration in knocking China around.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats insist they don't oppose free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but only that any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements must have \"labor and environmental standards\" written into them. Dr. Dean has told several interviewers that he would withdraw from the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if they weren't altered to ensure that foreign workers have \"the same labor laws and labor standards and environmental standards\" as the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this is a recipe for precisely the kind of U.S. unilateralism they claim to deplore in the Bush Administration. Not many other countries are pleased to import another country's labor laws. Poor countries with low wages especially resent the forced imposition of U.S. rules that assume a far higher standard of living.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Lieberman noted in this month's Albuquerque debate, \"That would mean we'd break our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with Mexico, with Latin America, and with most of the rest of the world. That would cost us millions of jobs. One out of every five jobs in America is tied up with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. So if that ever happened, I'd say that the Bush recession would be followed by the Dean Depression.\" Dr. Dean tried to backtrack that he'd accept \"international\" standards as well, but his protectionist bent is clear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may be that some of this is due to the free-for-all that the Democratic race has become. The candidates are looking for any edge, and in particular they covet the early endorsement of the AFL-CIO that helped Al Gore beat Bill Bradley in 2000. Union members are a huge share of the nominating electorate, especially in Iowa, where Dr. Dean hopes to knock Mr. Gephardt out of the race.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet promises made during a campaign are hard to break. Mr. Bush's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> record is less than sterling, with its steel tariffs and the recent collapse of global talks in Cancun. So <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> would be one issue where the Democratic nominee could campaign as the more pro- growth candidate who supports American global economic leadership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the Democrats are falling for the fool's gold of protectionist politics. The polls always look at first glance as if bashing foreigners on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is popular. But campaign history is littered with politicians who have tried it and been rejected. No major American political party has nominated an avowed protectionist since Herbert Hoover in 1928 -- and we know how that turned out.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410159904.xml", "text": "<h2>At Best, a Pander; The Democratic candidates' intemperate promise to renegotiate NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NEVER illuminating, the Democratic presidential primary debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy took an especially dim turn last  week. In their final head-to-head meeting before Tuesday's Ohio and Texas primaries, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) declared that they would opt out of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico unless those two countries renegotiated the pact's labor and environmental provisions to the United States' liking. For two candidates who pledge to repair U.S. standing in the world, it was an odd swipe at our next-door neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mexican and Canadian officials recoiled at the prospect of overturning settled political and economic expectations in their countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could the Democrats mean? Labor and the environment are covered by \"side agreements\" to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, negotiated by President Bill Clinton, that call on all three countries to make and enforce good laws. The more recent U.S.-Peru <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Agreement went further, requiring Peru to change its labor laws to meet International Labor Organization standards. Both Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton, who supported the Peru deal, see it as a model for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation with Mexico, according to their advisers. But if that's all the candidates have in mind, they are wildly overpromising: The Peru pact's labor and environmental standards are only incrementally stronger than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreements. Meanwhile, the risks of renegotiation are huge. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is controversial in Mexico, too; farmers there are outraged by American agricultural imports. If the Mexican side asked that tariffs be reimposed on U.S. grain as part of a renegotiation, would President Obama or President Clinton sacrifice American farmers whose votes they were seeking only yesterday in Iowa? Or would he or she pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? If the latter, the tariffs on both sides would revert to the levels of 14 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whole U.S. industries have grown up to take advantage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Meanwhile, none of the U.S. jobs that left for Mexico would come back; they'd simply go to China, India or elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic candidates understand that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the developing world has both costs and benefits, which are not evenly distributed across the United States. Two days before last  week's debate, Mr. Obama said, \"I don't think it's realistic for us to repeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" because that \"would actually result in more job loss . . . than job gains.\" Ms. Clinton awkwardly pleaded that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has benefited some parts of the country  --  such as Texas. Yet the urge to win Ohio trumped, and both Democrats made a threat that, if taken seriously, can be described only as reckless.  In other words, we have to hope that they were only pandering.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2226641523.xml", "text": "<h2>A united front on China?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S repeated tariff skirmishes with U.S. trading partners have forced us to adopt a new definition of progress on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Rather than actual advancement toward open and equitable access to global markets, for the United States and for all countries, progress now means avoiding retreat from that goal. By that heavily discounted measure, there was progress on two fronts this week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday,</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump agreed to drop the steel and aluminum tariffs he had levied against Canada and Mexico on spurious national security grounds. In return, he received an end to those two neighbors' retaliatory tariffs and a pledge from them to do more to prevent the transshipment of metals from China, whose subsidized overproduction is at the root of the international metals industries' woes. Ending these tariffs removes what politicians in all three countries, including key Republicans in the Senate, had branded an obstacle to ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Mr. Trump's replacement for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, the USMCA epitomizes our discounted definition of progress, because it actually diminishes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the crucial automotive sector (while adding some modest, and necessary, updates to the current North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement). Mr. Trump's threatened alternative, however - a U.S. renunciation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and a breakdown in hemispheric commerce - would be worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump postponed for six months a decision on whether to hit foreign automakers with new tariffs. The alternative was to impose them pursuant to a review process that the president ordered last year, which found auto imports, most of which come from Germany and Japan, to be a threat to national security, despite the fact that many U.S. consumers like Audis, Mazdas and the rest, and that those two countries have mutual defense treaties with the United States. With passenger vehicles imports worth $191.7 billion last year, and an additional $158.8 million of vehicle parts potentially affected (directly or indirectly), the threatened tariffs faced tremendous resistance from both U.S. automakers and those abroad, who understand the fragility of carefully constructed international supply chains. This has apparently stayed Mr. Trump's hand, pending further talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reduced tensions with trading partners in Europe, Asia and the Western hemisphere  let the Trump administration focus its attention on negotiations with China, where it has the strongest argument for playing hardball. It is even possible that traditional U.S. friends, who have their own disagreements with Chinese mercantilism, might rally to Mr. Trump's side in that contest, even at this late date and despite the gratuitous fights he has picked with them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A united front against China is the strategy Mr. Trump should have pursued from the beginning, and it's far from a sure thing he can organize an effective collective effort now. As we said, though, the first step in making things better is to cease making them worse.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429235383.xml", "text": "<h2>Health Care -- By-And-By</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The autumn leaves won't be blowing across Lafayette Square for a while yet, but Washington is already aflutter with contradictory advice for President Clinton on his legislative agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of it is malicious. The Republicans would like to scuttle health care. The Perotistas and a peevish lot of Democratic House members would like to humble Mr. Clinton on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of it is confused. Senior economic aides want a big push on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> while the top political advisers want Mr. Clinton to stick with his health care mandate and not get sidetracked on a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill inherited from President Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And on every side, one hears warnings of a rough new beast from Congress that lopes alongside the dread monster known as Gridlock. This new critter, called Overload, is said to batten on the unselective yearnings of an Oval Office novice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what's a President to do? Well, it wouldn't hurt to take another look at the worst-of-all-worlds agenda being pushed by his top advisers. Their plan calls for Mr. Clinton to put his prestige on the line to press for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as the main must-pass legislation for the fall. His big health care address in late September would be used not to introduce legislation but to initiate deliberations that would not produce a vote until mid-1994. Some essential parts of the Clinton campaign package, like reforms to reduce the role of special interests, do not have a prominent place on this agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do history and current political realities suggest that this is a sound approach? Not really.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The treaty is worth passing, but not at great cost. It could wind up looking like a Clinton version of President Carter's treaty on the Panama Canal. Mr. Carter spent huge political capital on the treaty. The problem was that no one really cared about the canal, except possibly Ronald Reagan, who used its surrender as a club against Mr. Carter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So who cares about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Certainly not organized labor or environmentalists or the Democrats who represent them. This is, after all, Bush legislation rooted in the tradition of Republican free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs. A canny decision would be to let Senator Bob Dole and his fellow Republicans do some heavy lifting and to saddle House Speaker Tom Foley with the responsibility for the troubled House. Mr. Foley, after all, is supposed to keep order among the Democrats, and right now his whip, David Bonior, is rounding them up to oppose their President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The next task is to get health care on a faster track. This issue, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, is where Mr. Clinton should risk defeat. We have just finished eight months of largely secret talks about how to reform health care. To promise another 12 months of deliberation invites public disenchantment. Yet the current plan is to use Mr. Clinton's health care speech to outline the principles of the program rather than its legislative design.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Something is amiss here. Mr. Clinton has a passionate commitment to create a health care system that would stand as a monument of American social legislation. The American people want that to happen. So by what logic does it follow that he should be gambling his less than abundant supply of prestige on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rather than health care?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here is one answer: Some White House aides fear that Mr. Clinton does not have the votes to pass his program. They hope that a victory on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with Republican and Democratic votes, will make him look like a bipartisan muscle man.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it is really a strategy for the faint of heart. If Mr. Clinton sticks to it, that speech on health care better be a doozy. In it, he will have to explain why it was smart to throw out a do-nothing Republican for a by-and-by Democrat.</p>\n"}

Mexico's native crops may be traditionally grown and managed, but they are genetically sophisticated, far from primitive. Farmers have created a constellation of corn varieties for specific uses, from tortillas to tamales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Mexico imports millions of tons of corn from its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> neighbors, some of that foreign seed might find its way into its cornfields. It is likely that some farmers experimentally planted seed imported from Canada or the United States for human or animal consumption (seed technically known as \"grain\").</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost half of that corn seed contains engineered genes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If a transgenic corn plant in a Mexican field had a chance to flower and cross-pollinate others, then the seed it sired would carry engineered genes. Because it's not unusual for corn pollen to fertilize ears hundreds of feet from a source plant, some transgenes could end up in a neighbor's crop.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But are unintended engineered genes in Mexican corn a big deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That question was addressed by a report released last year by the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation which studies the environmental impacts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The report came at the request of Mexican organizations worried about what these unexpected genes might mean for Mexico's environment and health.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regulatory scientists in the United States, Canada and a few other countries have approved the commercial production of corn with certain transgenes for insect resistance and herbicide resistance. The first variety was approved in the United States a decade ago, without subsequent evidence of environmental or health effects. The fraction of genetically engineered corn has grown to about 40 percent of the U.S. crop.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not so fast</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it's good enough for the United States, shouldn't it be good enough for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not without Mexican regulatory scrutiny.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Commission for Environmental Cooperation recommended reducing the likelihood that imported GE corn is planted in Mexico until scientists there can consider the impacts of GE corn in Mexico. This recommendation makes sense for two reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, regulators in one country don't consider possible impacts of transgenics beyond their borders. I once asked a regulator why a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision document didn't mention that corn naturally hybridizes with its wild relative, teosinte. He said, \"Teosinte doesn't grow in the United States, only Mexico. It would be presumptuous to tell the Mexican government what to do.\" And he is right. Environmental context is important. What is considered a crop in some countries may be a nasty weed elsewhere. Mexican government scientists haven't yet studied the impact of American transgenic corn in the Mexican environment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wouldn't Americans be anxious and angry about importing millions of tons of living transgenic seed deregulated in, for example, China, but not by our own regulatory scientists? Clearly, this issue of regulatory sovereignty is critical.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, unintended transgene spread could create corn varieties that might not be as benign as the intended varieties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corn has been the species of choice for genetic engineers who create plants to produce pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals not intended for human consumption. The USDA has approved hundreds of field tests for corn engineered to create such chemicals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of these chemicals wouldn't be harmful if they inadvertently ended up in food. But others would result in adverse health effects, if they occur at high enough levels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stringent confinement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, current U.S. regulations require fairly stringent confinement for so-called pharm crops; thus, if a few pollen grains strayed, siring transgenic seeds that entered the U.S. food supply, the concentration of such compounds would likely be too low to be of consequence or to even be detected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because more than 99 percent of American farmers grow hybrid varieties, which are sterile, and thus buy new seed every year, it would be close to impossible for the frequency of such genes (and their unwanted products) to increase in farmers' fields or the U.S. food supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's different for Mexico. Some Mexican farmers use hybrid varieties and do not replant seed. But thousands of others plant saved seed from a previous harvest, often experimenting with seed from their neighbors or taken from a bag of grain distributed for human or animal consumption. Bags of grain for consumption have come increasingly from Mexico's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the worst-case scenario.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Assume a tiny fraction of corn seed imported into Mexico contains a transgene that creates a chemical that would have serious health effects in sufficiently high concentrations. Then assume a farmer experimenting with imported seeds plants one with the chemical- producing transgene. Finally, assume that gene confers an advantage to plants that bear it, resulting in more seeds or more pollen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then, the conditions are right for the gene to evolve, increasing in frequency, undetected, generation by generation. The chemical also increases in concentration in the food supply until it eventually has serious effects on the health of those eat it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sound far-fetched?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although this scenario is unlikely, each separate step has already happened. For example, both the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency have reported compliance violations in the United States involving seed- and pollen-mediated escape of pharmaceutical- producing corn genes. Luckily, the violations were caught in time, and crop products were destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The limited planting of pharm corn (a couple of hundred acres) at this time makes international leakage extremely unlikely. But the popularity of pharm crops and the hazard posed by the \"worst-case scenario\" make clear that now is the time for Mexico to start managing and monitoring the inflow of corn transgenes, as the Commission for Environmental Cooperation suggests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Managing and monitoring</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene flow could be managed by treating seeds in some way that prevents germination. Monitoring could be facilitated by requiring that transgenic seed be genetically marked, say, with a seed color trait.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some have criticized the commission's report as flawed and unscientific.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet its scientific basis is sound. Agricultural biotechnology has potential for great benefits. But like any new technology, with potential benefits come potential risks. Like other modern technologies, from electrification to the automobile, the wise use of science maximizes benefits while minimizing risks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Norman C.

They have only notified Mexico of their \"intent to submit claims to arbitration\" under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is no longer in force but under the USMCA, until July 2023, companies that made investments during the life of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> enjoy legacy investment-protection rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2014aka AMLO\u2014could respond to the notification by restoring Monterra's rights to operate its facility.

The notification suggests the local Monterra company endured a combination of both before Mexico finally expropriated the property in violation of the country's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> commitments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2014 Mexico opened its energy markets to private investors, foreign and domestic. In 2016 the Energy Regulatory Commission published a resolution \"providing a legal framework for the storage and transportation through pipelines of oil products and petrochemicals,\" the investors write. In May 2018 the regulator issued a 30-year permit to the local Monterra subsidiary \"for the design, construction, and operation of a storage facility for refined oil products.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO was inaugurated in December 2018, promising a \"fourth transformation\" of Mexico in which the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex, is supposed to recover monopoly power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the new president's ideology, Monterra's actions suggest that it remained confident in the country's institutions. The investors say the company was in communication with the Energy Regulatory Commission and complied with all documentary requirements. A September 2020 revised request for approval of storage rates received no response, which meant by law it was \"deemed automatically approved.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Later that year and throughout most of 2021 the regulatory environment grew more difficult. The investors charge that the commission \"harassed\" the local company \"with duplicative and pretextual requests for information and documents that it already had.\" The company obeyed the redundant orders. Meantime it says it \"continued construction of the Storage Terminal, a massive, multi-phase undertaking that carried substantial investments\" and kept the regulatory commission informed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The trouble went beyond paperwork.

But Mr. Biden wanted theater for the environmental lobby, which trumped respect for an investor's right to be treated fairly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TC Energy isn't challenging the Administration's climate views, and its suit isn't about reviving a project that promised to carry 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude a day to the Gulf Coast. The same oil will now be carried on trains, trucks and ships, albeit with greater risks of a spill and greater use of carbon energy. The company merely wants compensation for lost investment that is tantamount to expropriation under international law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Biden's cancellation raises the broader question of whether investor protections in the U.S. now blow with the wind, changing when administrations do. That view will be reinforced by the decision of former U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer to kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s investor-state dispute mechanism in the USMCA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer argued that the protection was a subsidy for Americans to invest abroad. The TC Energy case shows how wrong that was. Without a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> arbitration panel, Canadian investors will be helpless against Biden environmental policy since a lawsuit against a U.S. President in U.S. domestic courts has little chance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canadians and Mexicans retain investor protections under the Trans-Pacific Partnership <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, which the U.S. did not join. But cross-border investments between the U.S. and its largest trading partner are now unprotected.

{"id": "429251496.xml", "text": "<h2>One Specious Argument for Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the Congressional vote on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement shaping up as a nail-biter, advocates on both sides of the issue are firing away with arguments fair and foul, hoping to swing critical votes their way. On balance, the pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side has argued more carefully and, in our view, more persuasively.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But one line of pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argument insults North Americans on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border. Delay or defeat of the treaty, some claim, would have disastrous consequences for U.S. foreign policy in Mexico and throughout Latin America, undermining reformers and speeding a return to the anti-gringo nationalism of the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That contention misreads the revolutionary reorientation of economic thinking that in recent years has transformed Latin America between Tierra del Fuego and the Rio Grande. And it ignores the fact that for all President Salinas' accomplishments on economic reform, he and his Institutional Revolutionary Party remain an obstacle to fuller democracy in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parties as diverse as Argentina's Peronists, Chile's Christian Democrats, Venezuela's socialist Democratic Action Party and Mexico's PRI have embraced free-market, free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies, welcoming U.S. investments and imports that once were denounced as instruments of neo-colonial bondage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason for this changed attitude is plain. For decades, Latin America's protected economies sank into stagnation and debt while those of East Asia, initially more backward, achieved rising living standards through export-led growth. Beginning at the end of the 1970's with Augusto Pinochet's Chile, Latin policy makers abruptly reversed course. Chile's success inspired many imitators.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past decade democracy and market economics have largely advanced hand-in-hand in Latin America. For years, protectionism and government-sanctioned monopolies had been used to shore up support for the old authoritarian regimes. But those government-provided goodies enriched only the privileged few. Broader democratic electorates seem more interested in lower inflation, less bureaucracy and faster growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the long run freer political choices are likely to reinforce freer economic choices. And freer political choices -- that is, wider democracy -- ought to the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy, in Latin America as elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in Mexico, politics and economics are on a collision course. President Salinas' PRI has ruled Mexico for more than six decades without interruption, relying heavily on economic patronage and blatant ballot-box fraud. His own election in 1988 was barely credible. And the limited political reforms he has introduced since then augur poorly for next year's vote to choose his successor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the PRI context, Mr. Salinas is a reformer. But in today's Latin American context, Mexico is not much of a democracy. Americans should decide the fate of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the merits -- its likely effects on the U.S. economy, on the Mexican economy and on the prospects for better understanding and cooperation between two neighboring peoples. The fate of particular political parties or candidates has no obvious place in these calculations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mexico is going to have reasonably fair elections next year, it would be best that the U.S. not take sides. If it isn't, cross-border relations are in for trouble, with or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2033984997.xml", "text": "<h2>The Nafta Ultimatum Strategy; Trump's trade rep thinks Democrats will save his trade rewrite. Bad idea.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A theory gaining ground in Washington is that President Trump has begun to grasp the economic importance of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) to his Trump state constituents and political future. You wouldn't know it by watching U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer negotiate the final stages of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rewrite with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legislatures in all three countries will have to approve the amended pact and that won't be easy this year with midterm elections in the U.S. and presidential and congressional elections in Mexico in July. The earliest Mexico's Senate will receive the text for a vote, requiring a two-thirds majority, is during its lame duck session in August, which doesn't favor passage. Things could get even more difficult once newly elected senators sit down after Sept. 1. Similar difficulties are likely on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This makes a prompt and mutually beneficial resolution all the more crucial. Yet Mr. Lighthizer recently pushed the next ministerial round of talks to May 7 as he flew to negotiate with China. His team last week also increased demands that workers making cars and car parts in Mexico receive higher minimum wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The outlook is troubling largely because of this and other U.S. poison pills. Mr. Lighthizer is dug in on his demand to kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s multilateral arbitration panels that rule on state-to-state disputes. Mexico and Canada oppose this as they do the Trump Administration's five-year \"sunset\" provision, which means <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would expire without affirmative steps by all three governments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump Administration is also obsessed with micromanaging the auto industry. Last week it asked that 40% of North American cars and 45% of light trucks be built with labor that is paid at least $16 an hour. Fifteen percentage points of this could come from high-skilled workers but the rest would have to be paid to blue-collar workers in manufacturing and assembly. This is up from an earlier demand of 30% and 5% a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has good reason to reject this anticompetitive, market-distorting red tape. A wage mandate is ferociously debated in U.S. politics. Why does Mr. Lighthizer, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> lawyer with no notable businesses experience, think he can or should dictate wages in another country?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the real damage here would be to U.S. workers. The same goes for other new burdens such as requiring that 70% of steel and aluminium used in manufacturing be sourced in North America. Their jobs have been saved by freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which has allowed production and labor efficiencies that have made the U.S. auto industry and more competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this would also harm the availability of capital as investors flee the rising costs of doing business on the continent. The paperwork, administration and complexity of operations necessary to prove compliance with the new labor rules would be further incentive to invest somewhere else.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if Mr. Lighthizer gets Mexico and Canada to yield, Republicans are threatening to reject the revised pact if it includes Mr. Lighthizer's demand to strip arbitration panels for investor-state disputes. U.S. business relies on these panels to protect property in Mexico and Canada. More than 100 Members of Congress have signed a letter to Mr. Lighthizer warning him against this provision.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer doesn't seem to care. He wants to present Congress with an ultimatum to approve the renegotiated agreement or watch Mr. Trump let <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> expire. On Tuesday Mr. Lighthizer said he expects to have a deal in a week or two and predicted that Democrats will help him pass it. These are apparently the AFL-CIO-backed Democrats who couldn't deliver a majority for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with Democrats in the White House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More likely, they'll call Mr. Lighthizer's bluff, let <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> expire, and blame Mr. Trump and Republicans for the economic damage. Maybe someone should inform Mr. Trump about the gamble his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiator is making with the U.S. economy, the Republican Congress, and, by the way, his impeachment that will come with a Democratic House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foreign Edition Podcast</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Foreign Edition podcast: The Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> team's trip to Beijing and a preview of Malaysia's election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "1977493381.xml", "text": "<h2>REVIEW --- Mr. Trump's Traffic Problem --- The president is right to stress reciprocity in trade; His mistake is to focus on the imbalances between countries rather than on the rules of market access</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Donald Trump has often been accused of being a protectionist. During the election campaign, he called for high tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and in his inaugural address he said that, when it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, \"protection will lead to great strength and prosperity.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president doesn't consider himself a protectionist. \"I'm absolutely a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r. I'm for open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but I also want smart <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" he recently said. His aim is to replace existing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, which he considers \"a disaster\" and \"one-sided,\" and adopt a new approach. As he told leaders in the Asia Pacific region at a November summit, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> arrangements should be based on \"fairness and reciprocity.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In setting out this principle, Mr. Trump joins a long line of American presidents who have endorsed fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and reciprocity. But there is a problem with how he frames the issue. Mr. Trump wants to achieve reciprocity not in the rules of the game but in a particular outcome: the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with individual countries. This is no way for the U.S. -- and the world -- to prosper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists since Adam Smith have argued that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance, particularly any bilateral surplus or deficit, is not the right measure of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s benefits. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit may sound alarming, but it has no significance by itself. What does matter is reciprocity in market access, and this is best achieved in regional and multilateral agreements. By abandoning or undermining these deals, the Trump administration has abdicated U.S. leadership. Even bilateral agreements, which Mr. Trump touts, may now be out of reach, because other countries are justifiably reluctant to negotiate about outcomes rather than rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's desire for reciprocity in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> goes back to the country's quest for independence. Among the many grievances cited in the Declaration of Independence was the complaint that Britain was \"cutting off our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with all parts of the world\" through its mercantilist regulations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the U.S. achieved its independence, the country was hopeful that its new standing would usher in an era of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. But Britain took a hard line, arguing that the U.S. could not leave the British Empire politically and yet remain a part of it economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1793, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson issued a \"Report on Commercial Restrictions\" that extolled the idea of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but documented the numerous barriers placed on American goods and ships in foreign markets. He proposed achieving reciprocity through a policy of retaliation: \"Where a nation imposed high duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be proper for us to do the same by theirs.\" But the U.S. was too minor an economic power to make good on such threats and, rather than risk a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war, opted instead for an imperfect agreement with Britain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most of the next century, the U.S. abandoned the quest for reciprocity. Congress set high tariff rates without regard to the rules set by other countries. By the 1890s, however, new developments prompted some to reconsider the wisdom of protectionism. The U.S. had become a net exporter of manufactured goods, and discriminatory <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies abroad were impeding access to foreign markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The prime mover behind a renewed interest in reciprocity was President William McKinley. Speaking at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo on Sept. 5, 1901, he declared that economic \"isolation is no longer possible or desirable.\" \"The period of exclusiveness is past,\" he said. \"Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times, measures of retaliation are not.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We will never know if President McKinley could have been successful in concluding such treaties because, just a day after delivering this address, he was shot and killed by an assassin. His successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was a passionate progressive reformer in many areas but not when it came to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Having repeatedly stated that the tariff \"should be decided solely on grounds of expediency,\" he found it expedient to do nothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last gasp of protectionism came with the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff increase in 1930. Focused solely on the interests of select domestic producers, Congress gave little heed to foreign protests that came pouring in, let alone to the concerns of U.S. exporters or consumers. Congress ignored warnings of possible foreign retaliation, and the international backlash dealt a swift and devastating blow to American exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift toward reciprocity finally came with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his appointment of Cordell Hull as Secretary of State. Hull believed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> friction between countries bred political friction and conflict, such as World War I. He helped to convince Congress to pass the Reciprocal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreements Act of 1934, which gave the president the authority to reduce tariffs in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with other countries. His main goal was to eliminate foreign discrimination against U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hull's efforts eventually led, after World War II, to the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, the cornerstone of which was reciprocity among members in the rules of the game. While the GATT didn't equalize tariff treatment of goods in all markets, it began to chip away at the discriminatory policies targeted at American exporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. also promoted the formation of the European Economic Community, a precursor of the European Union, in order to strengthen the continent's economies and to make them a more effective bulwark against communism. The EEC removed taxes on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between members and set a common external tariff. The U.S. worried that this tariff, and the preference for intra-European <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, would be prejudicial to American commerce, so Washington initiated negotiations to reduce the new barriers, resulting in revisions to GATT in 1967.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. took the lead again a few decades later in pushing other countries to reduce their tariff walls and subsidies, achieving yet another updating of GATT in 1993. This round of changes established the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization to protect intellectual property rights and to settle disputes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pattern across these historical episodes is clear: The U.S. has been active in promoting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> when it begins to face discrimination against its commerce abroad. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> negotiations have been a tool for safeguarding American interests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter now Donald Trump. Much of what the administration is doing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not new. To the extent that it has identified specific policies or practices that violate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules, addressing them is in the tradition of past presidents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One place, for example, where the administration is on firm ground in complaining about foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies is China. China's blatantly mercantilist \"Made in China 2025\" policy, involving local content requirements and the elimination of foreign suppliers, is the antithesis of an open market economy. But thus far, the administration has given China a pass, with the president saying that he \"doesn't blame\" China for its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is new and unusual is the administration's focus on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with individual countries. We do in fact have a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, for instance, but the rules of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> still hold: Mexico does not impose any duties on U.S. goods just as we do not impose any duties on Mexican goods. The same would have been true under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which the Trump administration withdrew U.S. support.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The focus on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations is misguided. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is not like a ledger, where imports are the cost and exports are the benefit, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses and deficits do not indicate that one country is \"winning\" and the other \"losing.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit is driven by macroeconomic factors, not by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The U.S. faced a battery of high <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in the 1950s, when its own market was largely open, and yet it ran <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit fell sharply in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, even though neither the U.S. nor other countries significantly changed their policies regarding imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just last week, the Commerce Department reported that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit had widened slightly. This is because the economy is doing well and the unemployment rate has fallen to almost 4%. We should not wish for another economic slowdown to put a further dent in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some circumstances, it may make sense to care about the overall balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. If the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit is viewed as a problem, the solution is for the U.S. to save more and spend less, like countries with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses, such as China, Germany and Japan. One component of America's poor savings record is the federal budget deficit: When it grows as a share of GDP (due to a decline in revenues or an increase in expenditures), it contributes to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it makes no sense to care about balancing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bilaterally with individual countries. A household may care about whether its overall spending exceeds its income, but it doesn't care about balancing each component in its budget. Everyone runs a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with his or her employer. Everyone runs a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with the grocery store, except for the people who work there. It is nonsensical to balance your checkbook bilaterally; just try doing that with Amazon or Costco.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with negotiating about outcomes rather than rules, focusing on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance rather than on market access, is that it can lead to managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. That happened in the 1980s, when the U.S. was worried about the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan. Managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is the opposite of the goal of establishing freer and fairer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> around the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump has complained about supposedly unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Japan, Mexico and Canada without ever really saying what they have done wrong -- aside from the imbalance in our bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with them. With Canada, the U.S. does indeed have a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit in goods, but it has an even larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus in services. Is this \"very unfair\" to Canada? Are we \"taking advantage\" of our longtime ally? What would Mr. Trump say if Canada said that we are obligated to intervene to reduce our surplus?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fixation on outcomes rather than on rules has distorted the U.S. negotiating position. The Trump administration's aggressive \"win-lose\" rhetoric not only puts other countries on the defensive but also baffles them, because the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance is not something that governments directly control. Emphasizing deficits and surpluses has made our trading partners less willing to negotiate and to make concessions on issues of market access. And Mr. Trump's precipitous decision to pull out of the TPP and his threats to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> mean that the U.S. is now viewed as an unreliable partner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration has even criticized Mexico and Canada's other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross complains that cars assembled in Mexico receive better treatment in the EU than those produced in the U.S. The reason is simple: Mexico has a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU, and the U.S. does not. Canada also just recently concluded a comprehensive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU. Both countries now have a leg up over the U.S. in exporting to the EU. The remedy is not to berate the EU for treating the U.S. unfairly but to conclude a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU as other countries have.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trump administration promised instead to conclude many bilateral agreements in Asia. But after seeing how the U.S. has treated its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> trading partners, other countries have not been eager to sign up for talks. Japan has already demurred, even though just last week Tokyo was able to reach a major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the EU. The administration professes to want bilateral agreements, but it will not get them if other countries are reluctant to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the rest of the world will move on and continue to reach <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that exclude the U.S. The 11 nations of the TPP have already gone ahead to conclude the agreement without the U.S. That will subject U.S. exporters to discrimination in other markets. Japanese cars will receive tariff concessions in Vietnam, Australian beef will be treated better than American beef in Japan, and so forth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein, perhaps, lies the silver lining. The more the U.S. stands apart from these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, the more U.S. exporters will face discrimination in foreign markets. President Trump or his successor will eventually have to play catch up to restore the equal access that American businesses will demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Irwin is the John French Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College.

That's the best case now for supporting Mr. Trump's revisions to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement to gain votes from Democrats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good news is that the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal puts to rest Mr. Trump's threats to abandon the 1994 agreement and blow up continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The new deal preserves most of the tariff-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's no small matter when through October this year U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and Canada exceeded $1 trillion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will be a relief to U.S. farmers in particular. Mexico and Canada bought some $38 billion in U.S. farm exports in 2016, up from less than $9 billion in 1993 before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The new agreement also opens the Canadian dairy market to U.S. producers for the first time, even if still too modestly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's particular political value in committing both Mexico's President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the left-wing economic nationalist known as AMLO, and Mr. Trump, the Republican mercantilist, to open trading rules for North America. This is especially important for Mexico, which is backsliding under AMLO's policies after decades of economic progress. If Americans think illegal immigration is a problem now, watch what happens if Mexico slides into Argentine or Venezuelan socialism. Economic integration with the U.S. is important insurance against Mexico becoming a failed state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shame is that in many respects the new deal is worse than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, especially its bows to politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The new deal tries to steer auto investment with new rules of origin that 75% of a car's content must be made in North America, up from 62.5% under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This raises the cost of manufacturing, making North American products less competitive worldwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also reducing North American competitiveness is a new rule mandating that 40% of an auto qualifying for tariff-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the region has to be produced by workers earning $16 an hour. Mandating wage rates ignores the relationship between productivity and output and sets a bad precedent for future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Mr. Trump is using the mandate to make Mexico less competitive for car production.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump Administration made these labor provisions worse in concessions to the AFL-CIO to get Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow a vote on the House floor. The unions battered Mexico to allow a new enforcement process that will give American unions a new way to intrude in Mexican labor disputes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If American activists complain about labor practices at a plant in Mexico, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative can call for a multilateral panel to rule on the dispute. If the three-person panel rules in favor of the complaint, the U.S. can then impose tariffs in escalating stages. The risk is that this will produce a flood of new complaints.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North American auto production costs will also rise thanks to a new layer of protection for U.S. steel. The new deal mandates that 70% of steel used in North American vehicles must be made on the continent, and in seven years that share will have to include so-called slab steel that is now often imported before it is finished into specific steel products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. auto companies say they can live with these higher costs, but other manufacturers may not. Some may find it makes more sense instead pay the 2.5% most-favored-nation tariff to import. Others will move full manufacturing to Mexico for vehicles and other products they export, reducing investment in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump also bowed to the Pelosi Democrats' demand to remove the 10-year protection for data exclusivity on biologics, a blow to one of America's growth industries. This won't change current U.S. law, which allows 12 years of protection, but Mexico allows only five and Canada eight. The new deal sends a signal that the world can loot American property rights\u2014and American politicians will cheer them on. This is the opposite of \"America first.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We thought Mrs. Pelosi would deny a vote on new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as she did four other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals in 2007, and on that point <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Rep Robert Lighthizer was right. But the deal could have been better for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had it been presented when Republicans ran the House. Our concern now is that the deal's concessions to politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will become the new baseline for future negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higher production costs and protection for politically influential industries won't help workers. Senators will have to consider whether these bad precedents are worse than the benefit of saving most of the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n"}

Most of the Constitution instead limits that power, as with the president's duty \"to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" or divides that power with Congress, as with making treaties or appointing Supreme Court justices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton argued that good government and \"energy in the executive\" went hand in hand. In The Federalist No. 70, he wrote that the framers, to encourage \"decision, activity, secrecy and dispatch,\" entrusted the executive power in a unified branch headed by a single person, the president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of Hamilton's intellectual admirers today endorse the theory of the unitary executive, which holds that the Constitution grants the president all of the remaining executive powers that existed at the time of the founding. These include the powers to conduct foreign affairs, protect the national security, interpret and execute the law and manage all lower-level federal officers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an official in the Justice Department, I followed in Hamilton's footsteps, advising that President George W. Bush could take vigorous, perhaps extreme, measures to protect the nation after the Sept. 11 attacks, including invading Afghanistan, opening the Guant\u00e1namo detention center and conducting military trials and enhanced interrogation of terrorist leaders. Likewise, I supported President Barack Obama when he drew on this source of constitutional power for drone attacks and foreign electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even I have grave concerns about Mr. Trump's uses of presidential power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign, Mr. Trump gave little sign that he understood the constitutional roles of the three branches, as when he promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would investigate Hillary Clinton. (Judge Neil M. Gorsuch will not see this as part of his job description.) In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump did not acknowledge that his highest responsibility, as demanded by his oath of office, is to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\" Instead, he declared his duty to represent the wishes of the people and end \"American carnage,\" seemingly without any constitutional restraint.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While my robust vision of the presidency supports some of Mr. Trump's early executive acts -- presidents have the power to terminate international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example -- others are more dubious. Take his order to build a wall along the border with Mexico, and his suggestion that he will tax Mexican imports or currency transfers to pay for it. The president has no constitutional authority over border control, which the Supreme Court has long found rests in the hands of Congress. Under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress can fund the construction of a wall, a fence or even a walking path along the border. And the president cannot slap a tax or tariff on Mexican imports without Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor can Mr. Trump pull the United States out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, because Congress made the deal with Mexico and Canada by statute. Presidents have no authority to cancel tariff and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws unilaterally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration has driven Mr. Trump even deeper into the constitutional thickets. Even though his executive order halting immigration from seven Muslim nations makes for bad policy, I believe it falls within the law. But after the order was issued, his adviser Rudolph Giuliani disclosed that Mr. Trump had initially asked for \"a Muslim ban,\" which would most likely violate the Constitution's protection for freedom of religion or its prohibition on the state establishment of religion, or both -- no mean feat. Had Mr. Trump taken advantage of the resources of the executive branch as a whole, not just a few White House advisers, he would not have rushed out an ill-conceived policy made vulnerable to judicial challenge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, for her stated intention not to defend his immigration policy, also raises concerns. Even though the constitutional text is silent on the issue, long historical practice and Supreme Court precedent have recognized a presidential power of removal. Mr. Trump was thus on solid footing, because attorneys general have a duty to defend laws and executive orders, so long as they have a plausible legal grounding. But the White House undermined its valid use of the removal power by accusing Ms. Yates of being \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\" Such irrelevant ad hominem accusations suggest a misconception of the president's authority of removal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A successful president need not have a degree in constitutional law. But he should understand the Constitution's grant of executive power. He should share Hamilton's vision of an energetic president leading the executive branch in a unified direction, rather than viewing the government as the enemy. He should realize that the Constitution channels the president toward protecting the nation from foreign threats, while cooperating with Congress on matters at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Otherwise, our new president will spend his days overreacting to the latest events, dissipating his political capital and haphazardly wasting the executive's powers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOHN YOO   John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of \"Crisis and Command: A History of Executive Power From George Washington to George W.

Mexico is still waiting for the U.S. to start trucking. Now the Obama Administration says it's ready to negotiate a pilot program to allow some Mexican long-haul trucks access to the U.S. market. With luck, the U.S. may be compliant in time for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s 20th anniversary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What appears to be progress is welcome, of course. But the Administration advised low expectations, attaching the caveat to its own press release that \"this is a very positive development, but it is not a done deal.\" In other words, the usual political suspects could still drive it into a ditch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recall how we got here. In 1995 the Teamsters got Bill Clinton to put the kibosh on opening the border to Mexican long-haul competition. Mr. Clinton alleged safety concerns. But this was still a clear violation of America's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligations. Then in 2001 a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel gave Mexico the right to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. exports. It did not do so immediately.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hopes were raised in 2007 when the Bush Administration launched a pilot program to monitor the safety of Mexican trucks, which after one year had achieved better safety records than their U.S. counterparts. Mr. Obama killed that program when he took office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That prompted Mexico in spring 2009 to impose (legal) retaliatory tariffs on $2.4 billion of U.S. exports. American business took a hit. In the first year of the tariffs, the Mexican government says imports of products on the list dropped 81%. It was the pain from those tariffs, not any free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> epiphany, that brought Mr. Obama to the table last week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and the U.S. will now negotiate a \"reciprocal, phase-in program,\" according to the White House. A document is supposed to be available for public comment by early April. But if Congress has concerns (the Teamsters, naturally, are already complaining) the U.S. may have to go back to Mexico for further negotiations. When a deal is signed, Mexico says it will lift 50% of its retaliatory duties. It will take another two to four months to implement the program, at which time Mexico says it will lift the other half of the tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all goes as planned, the result is likely to get us back to the equivalent of the 2007 Bush pilot program by 2012. That's what's known as a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> breakthrough during the Obama Presidency.</p>\n"}

It requires that 40% to 45% of a vehicle eligible for no-tariff treatment under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement be produced by workers making $16 or more an hour. It also requires that 75% (up from 62.5%) of a car's content be produced within the U.S. or Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first rule would shift production of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-eligible cars from Mexico to the U.S. The second would shift production from third countries (say South Korea, Germany or China) to the U.S. and Mexico. Yet the effect would be small. Only 27% of cars currently made in Mexico would be affected, and auto makers say adjusting won't be hard. Whether this means more U.S. jobs is uncertain. Car makers might prefer just to swallow the existing 2.5% tariff that applies to non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where those inclined to see method in Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> madness point to a pending Section 232 study by the Commerce Department, meant ludicrously to find that U.S. national security is threatened by auto-related imports, thereby allowing Mr. Trump to impose 25% duties on cars from Europe and Asia and possibly even Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Doing so would thoroughly disrupt global auto markets, driving up prices for U.S. consumers, and only eventually perhaps bring more auto investment to the U.S. A Mercedes or BMW from Germany might jump $10,000 in price; a Chevy Equinox, Dodge Caravan or Toyota RAV4 from Canada might jump $5,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Right now, such an outcome is unthinkable. Congress would hear from dealers and car buyers and throw itself athwart Mr. Trump's plan. Even the unions are ambivalent. In their public utterances, the Big Three -- Ford, GM and Chrysler -- are also opposed and presumably mean it, presumably.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Widely quoted was GM chief Mary Barra's apparently blanket statement on a conference call that \"we are free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs.\" Unfortunately her claim was preamble to a typically vague, noncommittal GM answer to an admirably precise question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question, by J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, is worth repeating: \"Has there been any scenario planning within GM that suggests that potential other changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could actually shake out positively for you? I know GM management stands for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but it seems to us that certain scenarios, such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> remaining but Section 232 tariffs applying to imported vehicles from outside the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bloc, that could actually end up being quite positive for you from a pricing or share perspective?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exactly. Protectionism can be quite profitable for companies that benefit from it, at least until they become fat and lazy and fall behind their overseas competitors in quality and technology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, in Trumpian fashion, has lots of balls in the air, and is proceeding chaotically as he did at times in his business. He may yet decide to go for broke. And Detroit, despite its investment in rising markets like China and its attachment to its global supply chains, could be the weak link in any resistance to a Trump impulse to turn the global car market upside-down.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly you wouldn't take to the bank anything that notoriously obfuscatory Detroit auto executives say about the matter right now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the blunt truths they are trained not to mention is that they embraced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the first place to use Mexico to level the playing field with foreign transplants that built their factories in the south to avoid the United Automobile Workers. Homegrown U.S. auto makers remain bound to the UAW while foreign-born ones in the U.S. enjoy a free labor market. This is a bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> distortion than any Mr. Trump is offering. It's also the cause of many other distortions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the Big Three's also-ran status in sedans is a legacy of John Dingell's \"anti-backsliding rule\" that for decades required them to build money-losing small cars in high-cost UAW factories. The Big Three's continuing dependence on excess pickup profits is a legacy of the 25% tariff on imported pickups that has evolved since the 1960s into Washington's main gift to prop up Detroit despite the many political burdens it must bear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So keep this history in mind. I wouldn't be 100% confident of Detroit turning up its nose at a big offer of Trump protectionism to solve all the headaches that continue to arise from Washington's 80-plus years of meddling in the car business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Holman W.

As I have said publicly in the past, I believe that Donald Trump was elected president because he gave voice to the legitimate rage many Americans feel about decades of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that have devastated communities nationwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The federal government has certified that almost 1 million U.S. jobs have been lost to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and millions more have been lost to misguided China <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. The Trump administration has promised to bring down massive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits and stop the outsourcing of jobs, but the president's policies have yet to deliver.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fixing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that for decades not only failed to deliver their promised benefits but also undermined the nation's economic well-being is essential. Doing so will help to sustain and create the good-paying jobs that will rebuild a beleaguered middle class and protect an industrial base that is vital to U.S. national security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is why congressional Democrats are insisting on critical improvements to the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that President Trump signed last year. If the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is more accurately described as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0, were enacted in its current form, it wouldn't stop the American job outsourcing that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> incentivizes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's labor and environmental standards and their enforcement are insufficient to stop corporations from continuing to move jobs to Mexico so they can pay employees less and dump toxins. Today, Mexican workers are paid 40 percent less than manufacturing workers in China and less than before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 25 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After decades of Republican and Democratic presidents alike enacting and defending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that harm working families, more than 160,000 jobs in my home state of Michigan already have been government-certified as lost to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone. But contrary to conventional wisdom about its impact on manufacturing centers in the Midwest, the greatest concentration of job losses from the pact is in the congressional district around El Paso and in California. Southern states have also been hard-hit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The race to the bottom, with the outsourcing of jobs and pollution, continues today. A U.S. firm opened a multimillion-dollar tire plant in Mexico recently where they pay workers $2 to $6 per hour to make the exact same tires that the firm's American workers are paid, on average, $23 per hour to produce. Chevrolet is paying autoworkers in Mexico less than $3 per hour to make Blazers shipped back to the United States for sale. U.S. workers making Blazers a decade ago earned more per hour than these workers make in a day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, Mexico passed labor-law reforms required by the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that are a step in the right direction. Unless the new Mexican labor agencies and inspections this new law requires are funded and staffed, wages for many Mexican workers will remain at sweatshop levels. Reasons to be skeptical: Dozens of lawsuits have been filed to block the new law, and Mexico recently issued a labor-agency budget that doesn't appear to include the level of funding needed to make the improvements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 would fail to discourage outsourcing by U.S. companies, but it also would</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lock in high medicine prices by giving new monopoly protections to pharmaceutical companies. That would allow them to charge North American consumers even more. Even as Trump talks about lowering drug prices, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 would undermine changes that Congress wants to enact to accomplish just that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These realities explain why congressional Democrats have insisted on further changes. The president must add enforcement of improved labor and environmental standards to counter job outsourcing, and the Mexican government must implement and fund these improvements. And the new monopoly protection for pharmaceutical firms must come out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China's unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies must also be addressed. The president is right about that. The Chinese manipulate their currency, ban independent labor unions so workers are paid wages with which the United States cannot compete, and export billions in products made by political prisoners in work camps while they crush American workers and firms with subsidized exports and steal U.S. intellectual property. But a chaotic White House <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy doesn't fix these issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president tweeted about me Aug. 31 accusing me of wanting him to \"give up\" on his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with China. What I want is a coherent strategy that maximizes U.S. leverage behind the right set of demands, not one that makes it easier for U.S. firms to relocate to China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, after Americans have endured 25 years of its damage; let's get the replacement right. The president must decide whether he'll work with Congress to improve the 2.0 version or keep pushing a flawed agreement that won't address the country's problems. Democrats - who deeply care about making good <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals and fixing bad ones - are prepared to work with him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer, a Democrat, represents Michigan's 12th Congressional District in the U.S. House.</p>\n"}

But the victory could induce the Administration to make misjudgments that could sink the far more important global negotiations in the 116-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, which face a Dec. 15 deadline for completion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s most important immediate effect will be to rescue Presidents Clinton and Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico from personal political setbacks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea of a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone had been around for 40 years before George Bush's espousal of it midway through his term. He supported it not out of any measured political and economic assessment but for the same reason he had chosen Dan Quayle as his running mate: he wanted to reward and encourage a young man to whom he had taken a liking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The young man was Mr. Salinas. Trying to modernize and open the corrupt, protected and state-dominated Mexican economy (and deflect charges that his Presidential election had been stolen), Mr. Salinas wanted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as his centerpiece initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had not been pursued earlier by the U.S., Mexico and Canada for valid and substantive reasons. First, Mexico was far less advanced and economically open than the other two. If this were the 1960's, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be akin to an embryonic European Community of Germany, France and Spain; Spain would need years of economic, financial, political and social adjustment to truly fit with the others.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, as a regional bloc <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be at odds with the international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment system represented in GATT. Countries not in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be on the outside looking in, and will face discrimination against their products. Caribbean chiefs of state already have protested.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By suggesting that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should be expanded gradually southward into Latin America -- and implying that the U.S. should consider joining a new Pacific bloc -- Mr. Clinton, perhaps unknowingly, has undermined the global regime of economic and financial liberalization that has served the postwar world so well. Faced with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the European Community, Japan is considering forming a new regional group with itself at the center. Other countries are also looking for a regional club to join.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House portrayed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a way to gain an edge on Western Europe and Japan, both beset by economic stagnation. This was the wrong reason to argue for completion of a North American deal. Western Europe and Japan, our principal security and economic partners, are in trouble; their cooperation is indispensable for global progress. They are not mere commercial rivals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Salinas and his Institutional Revolutionary Party will now face slightly less pressure to conduct genuinely honest elections next year. His economic liberalization will doubtless continue, and Mexico probably will not revert to hyper-nationalist policies. But the cost will be high: one-party, oligarchic domination for yet another six years by corrupt conquistadores posing as statesmen and national leaders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada, always something of a bystander in the three-way negotiations, must decide what it will do about the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions Mr. Clinton imposed on its products as he sought farm-state votes for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The new Government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, already forced to cope with Quebec separatism, may have little choice but to respond in kind to what Canadians consider bullying tactics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> victory saves him from immediate damage to his Presidency. But the price he paid for victory will be steep. It includes billions in spending obligations to buy key House votes. And his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> actions against Canada and other partners will make it more difficult to complete the GATT deal on time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's confrontation with the labor movement over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may well poison his relationship with it, at least for the time being, and make it harder to advance his health care reforms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His incredible promise to House Republicans that he would protect them next year if they were attacked for pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> votes cannot be kept. It has angered members of his party and core Democratic constituencies whose concerns go beyond <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Administration would do well to curtail its recent boasting that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will send a message to Japan and Europe\" and force them into high-noon concessions in the final stages of the GATT talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> victory will be hollow if Mr. Clinton uses it to try to bulldoze the rest of the world in the Pacific talks in Seattle -- and then at the GATT talks -- into accepting U.S. commercial ultimatums. America's choice about GATT, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, will provide real proof of whether we are optimistic and open or defeatist and closed.</p>\n"}

People pass freely, but so do infectious agents and syndromes. I've seen many in my time, mostly during Republican administrations. Few match the power or breadth of the Canadianized strain of Trump derangement syndrome. Whatever Mr. Trump does, Canadians are against it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Back in the early 1990s, Canadian unions, academics and \"celebrities,\" as well as Canada's Liberal and New Democratic Parties, passionately argued against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It would destroy us, they said. We would lose our sovereignty. We would lose our social programs. We would become the 51st state!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now President Trump has called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into question, and many former detractors are suddenly defending the deal. The dubious have become believers. True, some of this is because time has shown <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to be good for Canada, but most of it is reflexive. Canadian liberals are defending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because Mr. Trump is against it. The more he hates it, the more they like it. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government approached the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations as if it were dealing with Saudi Arabia or North Korea, making a show of bringing issues like gender equality and the environment to the table.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Actually, Mr. Trump is right about supply management and Canada's dairy industry. Getting rid of our 270% tariff on imported dairy goods would be a positive development for Canadian consumers tired of paying $12 for a wee bit of cheese.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But try telling someone struggling with Trump derangement syndrome that the current American president could be right about anything. Try pointing out to a Canadian who binges on Netflix that the programs he loves come courtesy of an American company.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or try pointing out that every sufferer of Canadian TDS watches far more American cinema and television than the homegrown variety. Most probably own an Apple product or three. Painful as it is to admit, Canadians are actually quite fond of American stuff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Odd, then, that another mutation of TDS causes some self-righteous Canadians to refuse to set foot in the U.S. for as long as Mr. Trump is president. I know people who, recently returned from living in China, proudly promise never to visit \"Trump's America.\" I can't keep up with the number of friends, relatives and colleagues who have chosen to go to Cuba this winter rather than their usual Florida or South Carolina, giving the occupant of the White House as their reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Evidently vacationing in an island prison with no civil liberties is fine but a getaway to the land of the free is not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one cure for TDS, apparently, is extreme cold. After about three weeks of below-zero weather here in Toronto, a TDS carrier I know managed to shed his principles when the opportunity of an inexpensive week in a sunny Southern state appeared. Note to Mr. Trump: A few more weeks of winter and Canada might give you what you want on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Adamson is a Canadian writer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Rondi Adamson</p>\n"}
{"id": "2116057499.xml", "text": "<h2>On NAFTA, Trump saves us from himself</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s an old theme of movies, TV dramas and even cartoons: A nasty villain ties an innocent damsel to a railroad track, and her terror mounts as a train hurtles toward her \u2014 until at the last moment, a hero comes to the rescue. It\u2019s also a regular theme of the current administration. The twist is that the villain and the hero are the same person: Donald Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, christened the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, is the product of his peculiar approach to disputes. First he heaps scorn on the status quo. Then he emits a torrent of demands and threats, some of which could be disastrous, generating anxiety and uncertainty. Finally, he extracts some modest changes, for better or worse, and invites the praise of a grateful nation. (In the case of North Korea, he then proceeds to fall in love with his negotiating partner, but that may be a one-time fancy.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a candidate, Trump reserved special disgust for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which he called \u201cthe worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever.\u201d He vowed that he would withdraw if Mexico and Canada wouldn\u2019t accept major changes. As president, he repeated his threats, raising fears among automakers and other companies that their carefully constructed transnational supply chains would be tied in knots.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But last month, the administration reached an agreement with the Mexican government, allowing Trump to crow about his deal-making prowess. \u201cA lot of people thought we\u2019d never get here,\u201d he said. He also indicated that if the Canadians didn\u2019t want to accept the same terms, they were welcome to climb onto an Arctic iceberg and float away. The Oct. 1 deadline the U.S. imposed on Canada raised the prospect that the whole package could collapse, to the detriment of the entire North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Commentary: Why our small manufacturing firm supports Trump on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \u00bb</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Letting Trump conduct negotiations with foreign governments is like leaving teenagers unsupervised at home for a weekend. You don\u2019t expect to find the place in better condition when you return; you just hope it hasn\u2019t burned down. It came as a relief that Trump averted the disaster he had threatened to unleash.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most important fact about the new version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that it would preserve more and destroy less than Trump led his followers to believe. But making a few changes and giving it a new name lets him strike a heroic pose.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress still has to decide whether to approve the agreement. But in general, it would preserve the North American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone, with zero tariffs on the vast majority of goods crossing national borders. Companies still would be allowed to invest, operate and shift production according to economic logic rather than government-created barriers. Special visas that allow professionals in dozens of different occupations to move from one country to another would be retained, despite Trump\u2019s notorious aversion to foreigners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some actual upgrades, as Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes. U.S. companies and individuals holding copyrights, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>marks and patents would gain safeguards against piracy. Pharmaceutical companies that have to spend fortunes to prove the safety and efficacy of their medicines wouldn\u2019t have to worry about generic rivals reaping the rewards. Canada would have to grant more access to its dairy market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Editorial: Trading up: This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rewrite should boost Midwest exports \u00bb</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most of what the administration got would impede commerce, restrict businesses and harm consumers. By 2023, at least 40 percent of the components in every vehicle would have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. The administration wanted that provision not to lift up Mexican factory workers, who generally make far less, but to force manufacturers to move production out of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans usually oppose minimum wage increases \u2014 which is what this mandate would amount to \u2014 but if the change were to cause layoffs in Mexico, the Trump administration would count it as an achievement. Hufbauer worries that the precedent will mean that \u201cDemocrats will put minimum wages in every future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.\u201d It would, of course, raise the price of cars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal also would weaken protections for U.S. businesses operating in many sectors of the Mexican economy, making them vulnerable to onerous regulations that diminish or destroy the value of their property.Why would the administration want to expose American firms to greater risk in Mexico? Simple: to discourage them from investing in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the outcome could have been much worse. In this case, it\u2019s good to see the damsel escape from the tracks before the train runs her over. And let\u2019s just forget who put her there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/chapman.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>schapman@chicagotribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter @SteveChapman13</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Steve Chapman</p>\n"}

How About Them Apples?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are President Trump's threats to terminate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement a negotiating tactic, his actual intent or throwaway phrases to feed his base and stir up media coverage? \"We are in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> (worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.

While the President may think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is \"the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made,\" our growers know it is the best apple <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal to date.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's apple industry -- valued at $4 billion at the farm-gate, or wholesale value, and estimated to create $15 billion in related downstream economic activity annually -- has thrived under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the agreement took effect, the U.S. apple industry has quadrupled and doubled its exports to Mexico and Canada, respectively. These top export markets bring $450 million in additional value to our growers and packers annually. In total, the U.S. apple industry exports a third of the 240 million bushels of apples it harvests each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> were terminated, we could see a double-digit percent tariff on our exported apples, disrupting long-established <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationships and shrinking earnings for many of our 7,500 apple growers and their employees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trading partners are like a well-stocked produce aisle. Countries have plenty of options. The U.S. is not the only nation -- or trading partner with Mexico and Canada -- growing apples. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ends, there are plenty of other nations with free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to pick from, among them Chile, New Zealand and the members of the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just because the United States isn't doing free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements doesn't mean other countries aren't,\" said Veronica Nigh, an economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, at the annual USApple Outlook and Marketing Conference this past August.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, most of the U.S. food and agriculture industry has realized success through <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

{"id": "2095421158.xml", "text": "<h2>The best thing about Trump\u2019s trade deal: It could have been much worse</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ANNOUNCING A new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Mexico on Monday, President Trump hailed the deal as a huge improvement over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and floated the idea of scrapping the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> name in favor of something like</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"the United States-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.\" In addition to reinforcing his threat to leave Canada out of the emerging deal (about which more in a moment), Mr. Trump's proposal to drop the word \"free\" as a modifier for \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" represented a rare victory for candor in his administration: Whatever else it may accomplish, his proposed pact with Mexico will impose new and costly regulations on the flow of goods back and forth across the southern border of the United States. These, in turn, will create winners (protected firms and their workers, probably) and losers (consumers obliged to pay higher prices).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the heart of the new U.S.-Mexico agreement is a series of measures the Trump administration intends to slow the relocation of automotive production to lower-wage factories in Mexico and beyond. Specifically, these will raise the minimum \"local\" North American content needed for a vehicle to enter the U.S. market tariff free, from 62.5 percent to 75 percent, and require that between 40 and 45 percent be produced by workers earning at least $16 per hour. The former responds to the reality of increased leakage of Chinese parts into the Mexican end of the North American supply chain; the latter constitutes what may be the first-ever industry-specific international minimum-wage agreement. The actual impact is difficult to foresee, but the spirit of these measures is clear enough: They express a zero-sum, \"managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" mind-set, not a genuine commitment to an increasingly free flow of goods and services, which the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> embodied.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In that sense, the other major change Mr. Trump's team negotiated, a 16-year life span for the deal, reviewable and extendable by the parties every six years, represents a possible saving grace. It allows for a future administration to re-liberate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> if so minded. For now, the challenge is to get Canada, the third member of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, to sign on, so as to minimize the disruption to regional supply chains. On the whole, Canada has little to fear from the new auto rules, given that it is already a high-wage producer. By giving Canada a Friday deadline to decide and threatening auto tariffs if it says no, Mr. Trump has made it hard for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to participate without enduring a gratuitous humiliation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, Mr. Trudeau may well swallow his pride and his misgivings, because the U.S. market is simply too crucial to the Canadian economy. Then it will be up to Congress to approve or disapprove Mr. Trump's handiwork \u2014 including all the details still to be ironed out among the parties. When lawmakers face that task, they should do so bearing in mind that this proposed deal represents ambiguous improvement over the economic status quo and constitutes a victory for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> only in a relative sense \u2014 compared with the far more radical and costly protectionist policies Mr. Trump threatened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Mr. Trump seems to think that the chances of passing new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> improve if he presents Democrats with the ultimatum of voting for new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or confronting the damage of terminating current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't how Democrats are likely to see it. They'll claim Mr. Trump negotiated a bad deal and demand changes knowing that if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> blows up and the economy suffers, a President always gets most of the blame. The media will naturally echo the Democratic view.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump needs the current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in place as insurance in case Mrs. Pelosi and House Democrats decide to defeat, or perhaps even fail to take up, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal. Democrats will be only too happy if Mr. Trump blows up old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> before a new one passes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2188507503.xml", "text": "<h2>What's behind the ballooning trade deficit</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, President Trump has been obsessed with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, viewing them (incorrectly) as a good measure of which countries are \"winning\" and which are \"losing.\" The United States has run a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit for decades, thereby designating us a perennial loser in Trump's worldview. He promised to turn things around by picking a few easy-to-win <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, by Trump's own measure, we're bigger \"losers\" than ever before. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade. Even worse: Our deficit in goods, which Trump for some reason emphasizes most, just hit its largest level ever.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are a few takeaways from this news, including that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast. The new release (plus some other disappointing data reports from the past few days) suggests gross domestic product growth last quarter may get revised down from the initial estimate of a 2.6 percent annual rate. Worried about a continued drag from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, some economists are also revising downward their forecasts for economic growth for the first quarter of 2019. (Macroeconomic Advisers, for instance, just lowered its first-quarter forecast to 1.2 percent annualized.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the bigger question is this: Why exactly is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit expanding when Trump promised it would shrink? The answer largely (though not exclusively) has to do with Trump's own economic policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be clear, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits - whether bilateral or otherwise - are not necessarily bad, nor are they a sign that other countries are somehow \"cheating\" us. They reflect broader trends in the economy, including savings and investment rates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Small or shrinking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy; in fact, as Bloomberg News's Shawn Donnan points out, the year the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit shrank the most was 2009, which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy. We were at the tail end of the Great Recession then, and, because the economy was bad, Americans bought less stuff from abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the U.S. economy is healthy, with economic growth relatively robust. This is partly because of the fiscal stimulus Trump has been pumping into the economy, through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes. Consumers have more money to spend, which means they demand more stuff, and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Simultaneously, other countries - including China and members of the European Union - have not been doing so hot. With the U.S. economy doing well while other economies are faltering, and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the dollar has strengthened, making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive (i.e., less competitive) in other countries. That, too, leads to higher <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits . . . and it's one of many reasons Team Trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries' economic woes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, in some ways, Trump's preferred metric of \"winning\" is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success. But it's also a victim of his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy failures.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has picked <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars the world over, with friends and foes alike. He has also threatened even more tariffs, including an additional hike in tariffs on Chinese goods, a new \"national security\"-driven duty on auto imports, etc. These actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is that U.S. companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs, which increases imports in the short run. Higher imports equal bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products - most famously, red-state goods such as soybeans and bourbon. So there has been less demand for U.S. exports. Lower exports also equal bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through - the new North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement gets ratified by Congress, China fully capitulates to all his wildest demands, the European Union and Japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars, etc. - our balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will turn around. There's reason to be skeptical, however, and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the ones that look more plausible, such as the implementation of the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, seem unlikely to move the needle. After all, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> looks an awful lot like the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, plus some language cribbed from the Pacific <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact Trump pulled us out of.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, the most significant change in the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal involves new content rules for autos, which are intended to lead to more manufacturing (and manufacturing jobs) in the United States. But, as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts have pointed out, these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect, leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from North America. Which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports, which would contribute to, you guessed it, a wider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1951409582.xml", "text": "<h2>Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to \"the ash heap of history,\" went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America's commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America's guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been \"losing,\" a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put \"America first\" while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America's reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America's standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.He did so despite the advice of his top people -- the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs -- who say the agreement is in America's interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can't abide his predecessor's accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America's word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?America's European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump's decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.Most economists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.If revoked or substantially renegotiated, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his \"base\" -- the voters troubled by economic decline -- by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise. It also undermines critically important global relationships, erodes American credibility and cedes influence and the investment opportunities that go with it to ambitious nations like China that are only too happy to fill the role.America First, Mr. Trump says.

{"id": "421578437.xml", "text": "<h2>Los Angeles Times Interview; Lagos; Chile's President Looks to Expand His Country's Economic Profile</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ricardo Lagos' election to the presidency of Chile earlier this year set a new landmark in the country's long transition from dictatorship to democracy. He is the first Chilean Socialist president since Salvador Allende, who was elected in 1970 and overthrown in a 1973 coup staged by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout his political career, Lagos has been a Western European-style social democrat. He is praised as a man always willing to walk the extra mile to reach consensus. During his presidential campaign, however, his political moderation cost him the support of the communists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos rose to national prominence in 1988, when he led a campaign to defeat a referendum to keep Pinochet in power. During a memorable television appearance, Lagos pointed his finger at the camera and, as if talking directly to the dictator, he told Pinochet that the country had had enough of his repression, torture and executions. Later that night, according to reliable sources, Pinochet was \"climbing the wall\" after watching the broadcast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos' act of defiance earned him the leadership of the Socialists, and in 1990, a coalition of the Socialist Party of Chile and the Christian Democratic Party won the presidency. Lagos served first as minister of education and then as public-works minister in two successive administrations. He holds a doctorate degree in economics from Duke University and a law degree from the University of Chile.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though he has been in office less than a year, Lagos has led his country out of its first recession in almost 20 years. Chile's gross domestic product is expected to grow by as much as 6% in 2001. Unemployment, however, continues to run at close to 9%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A confirmed free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, Lagos is pushing for more free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zones in the Western Hemisphere, starting with strengthening Chile's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Mercosur, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. After that, Lagos wants to revive President Bill Clinton's idea, first broached in late 1994 at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, of a hemispheric free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone that would include Chile, Mercosur and members of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement--Mexico, Canada and the United States. Because of its strong free-market economy and political stability, Chile is seen in the United States as the model for Latin American countries to emulate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos will be visiting California Nov. 28-29 to reaffirm his conviction that of all the countries in South America, Chile is the one most capable of creating its own Silicon Valley. To support his optimism, he cites Chile's high levels of education and high-tech communications infrastructure. Internet use in Chile, as a percentage of the population, is the highest in South America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos, 62, is an agnostic in a Catholic country. He divorced his first wife, with whom he had two children, even though divorce is illegal in Chile. Since 1971, he's been married to Luisa Duran de la Fuente. They have one daughter. He loves classical music and gardening.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was interviewed at the presidential palace, La Moneda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Question: How would you characterize the U.S.-Chile relationship?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answer: It is now going through one of its best moments. In the political realm, we share the same values. We both believe in representative democracy as the best form of government and we both place a lot of emphasis on the respect for human rights. Regarding economics, we both support free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

Chile has a very open economy. More than 50% of our products are imports. Very few countries have this level of openness. Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is very well-balanced. About one-third of it is with Europe, 25% to 20% with the U.S. and a similar percentage with Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But your main trading partner is the Mercosur <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc, isn't it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: With Mercosur, we have a political agreement more than an economic alliance. You do your foreign policy from your own region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you think the influence of the United States over Latin American countries has diminished since the end of the Cold War?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Most evidently. One of the effects of the Cold War was that the whole world understood Latin America was under the U.S. sphere of influence. I realize what I am going to tell you sounds a bit paradoxical, but the end of the Cold War brings a higher degree of independence to Latin America . . . as long as the United States continues to be the undisputed economic, political and military power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Can you negotiate a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the U.S. if the U.S. president lacks fast-track authority?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In Chile, I can negotiate any agreement, but our Congress decides whether to approve it or not as a package. I would expect the same from the U.S. I can't negotiate one agreement with the executive, then negotiate the same thing with the Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Why does Chile want to get more involved in the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Because economic integration must be followed by a common political mission. I want to believe that someday there will be a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hemispheric zone. Within it, Latin America could form an important bloc for negotiations with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: How advanced are negotiations with the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Politically, things are going very well. We, the presidents of the countries in the region, have found common ground. But if we understand Mercosur just as an agreement to deal with tariffs and customs, then the agreement is not advancing at the right speed. As you know, Chile's tariffs are very low, in comparison with those of other countries in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Is it true that Chile supports the idea of including Mexico in a larger version of the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I think Mexico can play an important role precisely because Mexico is already in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Aren't these economic groups often formed not to promote free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but to increase protectionism?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes. But we should not forget that there is another debate on the hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone underway. Every country in the hemisphere must understand that to make this hemispheric agreement happen, every nation must prepare itself for that moment. We should all understand that the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hemispheric zone would be one of the big blocs that will be in play in the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: You and Vicente Fox, Mexico's next president, have a very good relationship. How did that happen?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In 1997, when he was governor of Guanajuato and I was secretary of public works, he came to Chile. We agreed that the spirit of competition and the free market drives life in the global village. At the same time, we live in a world that needs public policies to restore some kind of equilibrium for people in desperate need. The free-market economy doesn't protect them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Could you elaborate?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I may want to have a free-market economy but I don't want a free-market society. Why? Because that would reproduce the inequalities created by the free-market economy. I want to live in a society that provides free quality education to everyone from elementary school to college. I want a health-care system in which those who can pay will pay, but those who cannot pay can be guaranteed a minimum of health care. Some people believe that by leaving the market free, its benefits will trickle down to the poor. I don't believe the trickling down happens.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Are you concerned about the current political instability in Peru?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My biggest concern is how to strengthen democracy in the region. It isn't good for Latin America to be perceived as an unstable region, because that hurts us all. That is why I hope the Peruvians can solve their problems. I hope they hold clean and transparent elections. As somebody once said, you may have a good house, but if the neighborhood is no good . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some say Chile has an illegal immigration problem, with Peruvian laborers, in particular. How do you regard them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: They come here looking for a job because the economic situation in their country, and in many other countries, is not good. I would like to find a way to resolve this situation within a labor framework. They suffer discrimination and often are cheated of many of the benefits they are entitled to as workers. . . . That is terrible. We recently passed a law to allow them to regularize their status, but we won't solve the problem as long as the different economic situations between both countries persist. You know that in California.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In the U.S., the illegal entry of workers takes precedence over their labor rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: That would be a problem. When you abuse the rights of a few workers who can't fight for themselves for fear of their immigration status, you hurt all workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Are you concerned that U.S. assistance to the Colombian military might lead to an arms race in the region?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I don't believe it will make us increase our military budgets. My concern is that if the Colombian issue is addressed only in military terms, the problem will not be solved. My other concern is that we will reach a point at which the countries in the region are forced to intervene in the conflict in Colombia. Yet, I can understand why the Colombian military is asking for arms to fight a group financed by drug traffickers who have large economic resources. We should also watch that the weapons the Colombian government receives are adequate for an internal, not external, war. With that kind of weaponry, they can't tilt the balance of power in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Should criticism of human rights violations be construed as a form of interventionism?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: When human rights were violated in Chile, we learned that whenever the rights of human beings are violated, another human being should raise his voice to denounce it. On human rights issues, there can be no borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you believe current U.S. policy toward Cuba makes sense?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: There is no justification for the embargo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: We just heard that retired Gen. Manuel Contreras, Augusto Pinochet's intelligence chief, was on the CIA payroll. Does that make him a traitor?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: To work for another country's secret service makes one a traitor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Have you demanded an explanation from the U.S.?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes, the Chilean foreign ministry sent a diplomatic note outlining the implications of that report and saying they were unacceptable. We also expressed our hope that such incidents never take place again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some Chileans have told me they believe the U.S. should apologize to Chile for its participation in the 1973 coup against this country's legitimate president. Do you agree?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I believe so. I think it does a country good to look back and reflect on its actions. Of course, the U.S. can look back and argue that the coup was a byproduct of the Cold War. However, I do believe that an honest explanation honors those who offer it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: An apology or an explanation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Well, that will be up to whoever does it. But his words must be clear and sincere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What would be the best way for Chile to put the Pinochet affair to rest?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: We have come a long way. Just a year ago, no one would have thought that Chile's judicial system was independent enough to lift Sen. Pinochet's immunity. I believe the affair should end with a judicial decision . . . and that includes the possibility of medical exams for anyone over 70 years of age.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In 1973, there was a trucker's strike just before the coup.

{"id": "398376305.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Exiles Set Policy Agenda on Cuba for Next Administration</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ever since JFK's withdrawal of support for exiles who attempted to retake Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, Cuban-Americans have formed a tight Republican block in U.S. elections. Now, however, in a stunning turnaround, many Cuban-Americans in the key states of Florida and New Jersey may be looking to a Democrat as the best hope of dislodging Fidel Castro.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the dismay of many liberal Democrats, Bill Clinton endorsed the Cuban Democracy Act -- almost six weeks before President Bush threw his support behind the bill. Introduced by New Jersey Democratic Rep. Robert Torricelli and passed last week at the close of the 102nd session by both the House and Senate, the bill tightens the U.S. embargo against Cuba. However, it also provides greater communication with the Cuban people through the re-establishment of direct mail service to Cuba and the upgrading of telephone lines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasing communications with the Cuban people while simultaneously tightening the embargo will, now more than ever, increase pressure for change in Cuba. Without a Soviet sponsor, and with diminishing Latin American aid, Castro is economically and politically isolated. My own impression of Cuba, after speaking with Cuban political leaders during a trip to Havana with business executives in June, is that change is in the air and time is short. Castro has booted his third in command (after his brother, Raul), imprisoned his own son and turned viciously on all political reformers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Short of violent change, Castro has just one option to salvage what he perceives as the chief accomplishments of the revolution: Step down while the education and health programs he established have a chance to survive him. Clearly, in light of his recent hard-line decisions, the chances of a voluntary retirement are slim. This is why the Torricelli bill makes sense for the Democrats and for Mr. Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a politically shrewd move, Mr. Clinton stood to Mr. Bush's right on the issue of Cuba, an issue the exile community is likely to vote above all others. Proof of the inroad that Mr. Clinton is making in this once Republican \"fortaleza\" is tangible: The week Mr. Clinton declared his support for the anti-Castro bill, he raised $125,000 in one night in a Miami fund-raiser on Calle Ocho, spoke to cheering crowds in little Havana's Versailles and Victor's restaurants, and returned with an additional $150,000 from an event in Coral Gables. Since then, even Tipper Gore has been greeted enthusiastically by rallies of Cuban-American Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By last month, polls still showed Mr. Bush leading Mr. Clinton in the Cuban-American community in Dade County by 72% to 23%. However, thinking among Dade County Republican Party officials is that if the president does not win the exile community by 80% to 85%, he will lose Florida. Recent elections bear this out: Sen. Connie Mack (whose amendment to the Cuban Democracy Act -- which prevents foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from trading with Cuba -- bears his name) won election by only 30,000 votes in an electorate of three million voters, a cutting edge shaped by the block of votes he received from 95% of Cuban-American exile voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Republicans should not take the Cuban-American vote for granted,\" says Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the powerful, Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. His personal campaign contributions to both parties during the past decade make him the largest Hispanic contributor in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton has met with exile leaders (the same leaders that Michael Dukakis refused to meet) twice, and now enjoys repeated audiences and tacit approval of leaders like Mr. Mas and open support of smaller exile groups, such as the Cuban-American Women for Clinton. Jeb Bush's strong ties in the Miami community are now mirrored by Hillary Clinton's personal relationship to the exile community -- her sister-in-law, Maria Victoria Arias, is a Cuban-American Republican living in Miami and mobilizing the community for Mr. Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the big political impact of the Cuban exile community extends beyond regional lines. Florida not only represents 7% of the nation's Hispanic voters, but the Florida Cuban community delivers 15% of all Hispanic campaign contributions nationwide. The Cuban-American community shapes Spanish television stations Univision and Telemundo, controls numerous radio stations, and, as of November, is assured of its third congressional representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now the Cuban exile community's political clout has even ventured into international affairs, apparently directly affecting provisions of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). Their interest was not in how increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> would affect the Cuban community, but a perception that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could have been an aid to Castro. Their fear: Mexico could purchase Cuban sugar and citrus for domestic consumption and then, under the agreement, sell its own sugar and citrus to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Accustomed to swinging into gear faster than a speeding lobbyist, Mr. Mas and other members of the Cuban community prepared an anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> campaign, including full-page anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> advertisements to run simultaneously in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. Two months before the Oct. 7 signing of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in San Antonio, Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called an emergency meeting with exile leaders, including Mr. Mas and an ambassador in Ronald Reagan's administration, Jose Sorzano. As a result of the meeting, the ads were pulled and a reliable Cuban source cites a five-point agreement by the Mexican government: 1) to deny Cuba concessional credits; 2) not to renegotiate its debt; 3) not to allow Cuba into the oil-trading San Jose pact; 4) to maintain its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Cuba at current levels and at international prices; and, 5) to provide no guarantees to Mexican private creditors who invest in Cuba.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in this country, many Cuban exiles are talking about voting for their first Democrat since JFK. Mr. Mas predicts that Mr. Bush could get as little as 60% of the Cuban vote, adding: \"Although I'm voting for Bush out of loyalty, Clinton's decisive support of the Cuban Democracy Act turned the Cuban-American community around.\" While it's too early to count Cuban votes in either New Jersey or Florida for either candidate, the Cuban exile vote, in two elections too close to call, may well turn the tide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Falk is a New York-based Cuban scholar and author of \"Cuban Foreign Policy\" (MacMillan).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Mexico Didn't Link <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> With Cuba\" -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1992)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>921016-0134</p>\n"}
{"id": "422191337.xml", "text": "<h2>Deal with the trade-offs; Despite the Democratic candidates' positions, NAFTA and similar pacts benefit the U.S. in the long run.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 14-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has become a hot issue in this year's Democratic presidential campaign -- in Ohio, at least. When Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama hit the hustings in the Buckeye State, they compete to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s biggest critic. But when they jet to Texas, which is also holding its primary Tuesday, the candidates have little or nothing to say about the pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disparity illustrates two truths about major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals: They're a magnet for pandering, and they produce both winners and losers. Ohio, like other states in the Rust Belt, is stinging from the loss of manufacturing jobs in the years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect. In Texas, however, communities near the border have blossomed with an influx of investment, jobs and workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the differences haven't just been regional. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals signed since 1980 have helped spur job growth for some types of workers while decreasing jobs for others. Men at the high and low ends of the career ladder have benefited, but those in the middle have suffered, while the opposite holds true for women, according to a recent study by economist Stephen Rose at the Progressive Policy Institute.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's job is to take the long view of what's best for the country as a whole. Although it's hard to pinpoint jobs lost or created because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, U.S. employment has grown far beyond even pessimistic estimates of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal's costs. You wouldn't know that listening to Obama, who declared in a recent speech that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage.\" His stance is echoed by Clinton, who scolded Obama's campaign for distributing a flier that said she had called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a \"boon\" to the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The centerpiece of both candidates' positions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that future deals must include \"good\" or \"strong\" labor and environmental standards. That's vaguely comforting and feel-good-ish, but it's also misleading. Higher standards won't protect jobs and bottle up capital in the U.S. over the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the best course is to embrace free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and fight for lower tariffs and other barriers to U.S. goods and services overseas. Protecting U.S. workers means giving them the education, training and, if necessary, retraining needed to compete for the higher-paying jobs that result from open markets. The capital and jobs that leave can help U.S. workers too by fostering stronger economies in the rest of the world and thus creating markets in which we can sell our products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increasingly global nature of business causes pain, but it's better to adapt to the competition than shake your fist at it.</p>\n"}

Who Can Blame Them?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone who says that China's President Xi Jinping does not have a sense of humor is definitely not following the news from the Pacific these days.China last week applied for membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that was originally negotiated by President Barack Obama precisely to counter China's economic power in the Pacific. Unfortunately, President Donald Trump promptly tore it up rather than learn what it was about and get Congress to ratify it, and the Democrats have since then made no move to revive the deal, known as the TPP.Beijing applying to join the TPP is the diplomatic equivalent of the U.S. asking to be a member of China's \"belt and road\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment initiative in Asia, or Russia applying to be a member of the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because it controls part of the Arctic north of Canada. In other words, a deliciously mischievous ploy.But it's a ploy that exposes a real weakness in U.S. foreign policymaking toward China, which has become the biggest challenger to American pre-eminence in setting the rules of today's international system in both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and diplomacy.China's announcement came the day after Britain, the U.S. and Australia took geopolitical competition with China to a new level by announcing a historic security pact to help Australia deploy the most advanced nuclear-powered submarines, to counter Beijing's growing naval clout in the Asia-Pacific region.But we need a strategy for not just containing China with submarines that could take years before going on patrol. We need a strategy for changing China's behavior today, which is what the TPP was partly designed to do.China was never formally excluded from the TPP by its Obama administration designers. But the message to Beijing was: If you want to be part of this American-crafted 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, you have to play by our rules. That's why reformers in China were intrigued by the TPP -- they saw it as a lever to open the Chinese system -- and hard-liners feared it more than submarines.But after the U.S.-U.K.-Australia sub deal, the Chinese obviously said to themselves: \"Let's have some fun. After the Americans were so stupid as to never join the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that they designed to keep us out, America in and its Pacific allies close, the 11 other partners went ahead without them. They even renamed it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). So, let's try to use the attraction of easier access to China's giant market to take over the TPP on our terms instead of America's! And what better way to counter the American submarine deal with Australia?\"It was a brilliant move. As The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday: \"A decade ago, it was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club led by the U.S. seeking to limit the influence of China's economic model. Now Washington is out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Beijing wants in -- as the group's biggest member.\"While China's admittance is not likely anytime soon (it requires unanimous consent of the members), just by applying Beijing is exposing how unserious the American far left and far right are when it comes to China. They rail against Beijing's human rights policy and then they block one of America's most effective tools to nudge -- and that is the most we can ever do -- China toward more transparency and the rule of law, i.e., TPP.\"Reformers in China carefully monitored the original TPP negotiations with the hope that China joining the TPP could lead to domestic reforms,\" said James McGregor, the chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide, Greater China. \"Those days are gone. In its new bid to join, China will likely try to use the lure of its huge market to entice the other members to live with China meeting some TPP requirements while muddying others.\"What makes this Chinese maneuver more ridiculous is that Trump was so ignorant about the contents of the TPP before he tore it up -- his main objection was surely that Obama had negotiated it -- that when he was first asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015, Trump incorrectly suggested that China was in it from the start. Trump was just ahead of his time!But Trump's foolishness had a lot of tacit support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their knee-jerk opposition to the pact -- even though it was designed by Obama to address all the core labor and environmental issues that the left did not like about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.Let's go to the videotape and recall what the Obama team -- not Trump, not the G.O.P. -- O-B-A-M-A -- built into the original TPP, which also included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.One of the largest multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets. It detailed intellectual property protections for the newest and most advanced American-made tech products -- like free access for all cloud computing services, which China restricts. It set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor. It banned trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a practice still common in China that may have played a role in the pandemic. It required signatories to permit their workers to form independent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child labor practices.Indeed, speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \"this TPP sets the gold standard in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to open free, transparent, fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" It would build in \"strong protections for workers and the environment. ... Respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\"Typical of a Democrat, though, candidate Clinton ran away from the deal when she ran against Trump, rather than explain that some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 would-be TPP partners were already coming into the U.S. duty-free, while our goods and services were still being hit with some 18,000 tariffs in their countries -- tariffs that the deal would have eliminated. By accounting for 40 percent of global G.D.P., the original TPP would have become a real standards-setter in the Pacific.The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that U.S. national income would also have grown by some $130 billion a year by 2030 with the TPP. Not huge, but a nice bump.This is all the more a tragic comedy because our Pacific allies actually gave America <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> concessions to create the agreement that they would not do before -- precisely because they wanted us in the neighborhood as a bigger economic counterweight to China's growing domination. And then we walked away, and now China wants to take our place -- on its terms.It is not too late for America to get back into the TPP and even strengthen it by insisting on stricter rules of origin (which Trump added to the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). This would ensure that if somehow China were admitted to the partnership, it could not get around U.S. tariffs on certain Chinese exports by moving their final assembly to Vietnam, while keeping the core value chain in China.I'll take America joining the TPP today over helping to deploy submarines years from now. By then, if America continues to stay out, the CPTPP surely will be renamed again. It will have the same initials but they will stand for the \"Chinese People's Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"Now wouldn't that be funny. ...The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "398344694.xml", "text": "<h2>The outlook: Trade policy stumbles on rich vs. poor states</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WASHINGTON -- Rich countries with poor neighbors are suffering a bout of economic anxiety.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fearful that Mexico might sap the U.S. job market, Congress may throttle the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which would phase in barrier-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the U.S. and its neighbors to the south and north. Similarly, the European Community has been slow to open its markets to the struggling economies of the former East bloc. In Asia, Japan invests heavily in the nearby \"tiger\" economies, but shields domestic producers from the low-cost goods that the tigers export.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Working out economic arrangements with less-developed countries \"is the forefront question of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy,\" says Gary Hufbauer, economist with the Institute for International Economics. \"The difficulties,\" says economist Herbert Stein, \"stem from a common error and prejudice that you lose jobs if you have to compete with anybody.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One problem is that the less developed states are edging into the world economy in the worst of times. The U.S. is experiencing a tepid recovery, with major industries still shrinking and restructuring. Western Europe is sunk in a general recession, with unemployment pushing toward 12%. Japan's been hit by the worst slump in years, its financial bubble largely deflated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Republic's minister of industry and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, complains that the EC's 1993 quota for steel imports is lower even than the previous year's level. But, citing economic conditions, he adds, \"I don't expect much improvement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the current environment, many see their less-developed neighbors not so much as a new market to sell to, but a threat to a shaky job base at home. \"We don't give a fig about the Mexican market,\" says Jock Nash, Washington counsel for Milliken & Co., a privately owned textile concern that probably would suffer if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> goes through. He argues that companies would shift production to Mexico, where wages are about one-tenth of U.S. levels, then sell their products back into the U.S. market. \"If American manufacturers move offshore to stay competitive in our own markets, we're through,\" he warns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Japan, whose approach to less-developed neighbors appeals to some Westerners, invests in the fast-growing East Asian economies like Thailand and Indonesia without allowing the resulting output to threaten domestic producers. Japanese plants in Thailand, for example, don't sell back to Japan, but to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics, however, are using imports and immigrants as scapegoats for broader problems afflicting low-skilled workers. Some economists argue that U.S. industrial workers are far more threatened by robots at home than peasants abroad. \"I don't think what happened to unskilled labor in the 1980s can be attributed to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with undeveloped countries,\" says Jagdish Bhagwati, economist at Columbia University. \"A great deal of work shows that 95% of the stagnation in wages in the 1980s is attributable to technology.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As technological advances increase productivity and lessen the demand for labor, wage levels for unskilled U.S. workers languish. But outside certain labor-intensive sectors where developing countries have an advantage, the U.S. has attracted foreign investors, some of whom choose the U.S. as a base for the larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> market. Mr. Bhagwati's studies show that during the 1980s, more jobs were created by foreign investors in the U.S. than by U.S. companies moving plants to low-wage countries like Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that productivity in the hinterlands of many countries still lags. According to a senior U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official, if Mexico grew as fast as Japan did in the 1960s, it would take 30 years to reach the productivity levels of Italy, which are well below those in the U.S. Similarly, East European productivity is years behind that of its Western neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those fighting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-opening moves \"just look at the narrow, first-order job losses,\" says Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley & Co. economist. \"What they don't point out is that as income levels rise, our developing neighbors look beyond their borders for high-value products.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the running U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico, which came to $5.4 billion last year, indicates that so far, Mexico's economic development is mainly creating demand for U.S. goods. Moreover, U.S. wages in export-related jobs run 17% higher than the average manufacturing wage, suggesting that international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is supporting higher-value jobs at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, both in the U.S. and Europe, the critics of more open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are drowning out the companies and workers that stand to gain. \"In Europe, the gainers from open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are a lot of people who make small gains, and the losers, like agriculture and steel, make big losses,\" says Jim Rollo, economist with the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fear-mongers circling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- and their counterparts overseas -- should focus on the real problem: namely, workers with low skills in a world economy that demands higher skills and ever-improving productivity. If the U.S. dumps <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and closes its borders to foreign goods tomorrow, that segment of the work force still faces a dismal future. At least with expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, says Mr. Stein, \"there should be some way to use the net gains to assist those who are injured.\"</p>\n"}
{"id": "1468227122.xml", "text": "<h2>It's Time for Nafta 2.0</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty years ago this month President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement into law. If there is one thing supporters and critics of this pact have always agreed on, it is the size of the stakes. In November 1993, Mr. Clinton, facing fierce opposition within his party, implored Congress to pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a vote for the country's future, a sign that \"we still have confidence in ourselves and our potential.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement to eliminate tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico has delivered undeniable benefits.

Regional free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> can help re-energize our sluggish economy, creating growth and reducing inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two decades ago, North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was an idea ahead of its time. Never before had two developed economies attempted a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with a developing country. Signed by President George H.W. Bush, Mexican President Carlos Salinas, and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Dec. 17, 1992, the agreement survived because of an extraordinary act of bipartisanship in Washington. After taking office in January 1993, Mr. Clinton, in a signature moment of his presidency, defied parts of his political base who claimed the treaty would destroy U.S. jobs and won approval by Congress with more Republican than Democratic votes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also opened the door for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements across Latin America, a catalyst for economic and political reforms. Mexico was transformed from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open, and it subsequently threw off decades of one-party rule. Today, U.S. products make up 40% of the contents of goods imported here from Mexico (compared with 4% in goods imported from China). An integrated market boosts exports and imports, and helps keep good jobs at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there have been unexpected roadblocks. The 9/11 attacks shifted the priority at U.S. borders to security, and away from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. It hasn't shifted back. Concern about illegal immigration and the explosion of drug-related violence in Mexico has meant that billions of dollars have been spent on our borders not to facilitate the movement of goods but to prevent the movement of people. Many Americans support those measures, while many Mexicans oppose them, reflecting persistent distrust between our populations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s unfinished business is also visible in antiquated infrastructure and regulation. For almost a decade leaders of the three countries have endorsed greater regulatory cooperation, with little to show for the efforts. Although $1 billion in goods crosses the U.S.-Mexico border every day, bottlenecks cost millions. All this contributes to less <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. North America's share of the world's product, which rose sharply during the first years of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, has been in steady decline and is now roughly 25%. We are not as competitive as we need to be.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several reasons now is the right time for new thinking. The border is largely secure and net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero. Immigration reform is back on the U.S. agenda, if tenuously. The Senate's immigration bill includes $6.5 billion for border security. How much should we invest in cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new era of energy innovation is also rapidly spreading across North America. The U.S. is forecast to pass Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil producer in 2015. Under President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico is implementing reforms that will allow private capital and competition into the state-owned oil industry. Meanwhile, President Obama has set the goal of doubling U.S. exports between 2010 and 2015. On Nov. 8, the president called for billions of infrastructure investment to increase exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is in negotiations over two major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving 11 countries that include Japan (but not China) and a trans-Atlantic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Europe. These negotiations are a chance to improve regional competitiveness through convergence of North American regulations, bringing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in line with these new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic shifts and cultural understanding are making North America more interconnected. The number of Hispanics living in the U.S. has doubled since 1990 to more than 50 million, two-thirds of whom have Mexican heritage. A recent American University poll released in October showed that there remains widespread support among Canadians (80%), Mexicans (74%) and Americans (65%) for regional free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still a work in progress. But as we search for ways to reinvigorate the U.S. economy, freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and greater cooperation with our North American neighbors is a clear winner, and perhaps an opportunity for another bipartisan moment in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. McLarty served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, counselor, and special envoy for the Americas.

{"id": "1661212339.xml", "text": "<h2>Will the GOP deliver Obama's best legacy?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Froman received from a Harvard Law School classmate, Barack Obama, a job that validates the axiom that the unlikelihood of any negotiation reaching agreement grows by the square of the number of parties involved. In <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, even one's own country is troublesome, as the catfish conundrum illustrates. And the degree of difficulty in achieving a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact is proportional to the number of Democrats in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Froman's goal is completion and ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific nations, from Chile to South Korea, that generate 37 percent of the world's economic product. The TPP aims not just to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but also to reform some of these nations' domestic policies, particularly concerning labor and environmental issues, partly to entice certain Democratic constituencies to soften their opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some developing nations, such as Vietnam, welcome some compulsory rationality - being required by trading rules to limit subsidies to sclerotic state-owned enterprises. But beware of ostensibly altruistic protectionism - protectionism with moral pretensions. Sometimes poorer nations want higher standards forced on them. Other times rich nations use higher standards to raise production costs in, and thereby lower the competitiveness of, poorer countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Negotiation and ratification of the TPP will be easier if Congress gives Obama what prior presidents have received - \"fast-track\" authority guaranteeing an up-or-down vote on the agreement without amendments. But Obama's aggressive aggrandizement of executive power through unilateral actions (regarding the Affordable Care Act, immigration, etc.) has been unprecedented in its sweep and undisguised in its disdain for Congress. This has produced the much-praised but elusive joy of bipartisanship: Conservative Republicans, eager to express separation-of-powers rectitude, are joining liberal Democrats, eager to derail any agreement, in opposing fast track.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immersed in this political equivalent of three- dimensional chess, the administration is serenely confident that enough Democratic votes will join with large majorities of Republicans to ratify what is negotiated, even without fast track. Even if Republicans representing Southern catfish farmers must be mollified by restricting imports of Asian catfish that are processed in American plants in blue states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two largest achievements during Bill Clinton's presidency occurred in spite of Democrats. Welfare reform was forced upon him by a Republican-controlled Congress (he vetoed it twice before relenting), and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was ratified in spite of congressional Democrats (a majority of whom voted against it). Now, the TPP - potentially the best result of the Obama years - depends on Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are plucking up the protectionist banner unfurled by 19th-century Republicans, who were tireless defenders of the strong (manufacturers) against consumers. Today, many Democrats agree with Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who says that the United States \"has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Notice the slippery language (\"since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\"), and remember the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy: The rooster crows and then the sun rises, therefore the crowing caused the sunrise. Manufacturing jobs have been declining as a share of total employment since 1950 and in actual number since 1979. But because of productivity improvements, manufacturing production and exports are near all-time highs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Froman says, some imports substitute for domestic products. But many imports are \"intermediate goods\" that go into the production of domestic goods, some of which are exported. And, he says, 50 percent of imports from Canada and Mexico, our first- and third-largest trading partners, are used as inputs in the manufacturing of American products. Furthermore, Froman says, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is progressive in the sense that lower-income Americans spend a larger portion of their disposable income than more affluent Americans spend on such imports such as food and clothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You who are reading this column probably have a chronic, indeed incurable <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with your barber or hairdresser. You regularly buy what he or she sells, yet he or she never buys anything from you. But things somehow work out. As they do between nations, because as the late Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, once wrote, \"International transactions are always in balance, by definition.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Protectionism,\" said Clinton during the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, \"is just a fancy word for giving up; we want to compete and win.\" But now, even more than then, Democrats are the party of a United States in a defensive crouch, flinching from globalization's challenges. Besides, progressivism's constant agenda is to expand the role of government and contract the role of markets in allocating wealth and opportunity. Republicans rescuing Obama's best idea would be an interesting coda to his presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: George F.

{"id": "398783968.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Why Is Chile Still Waiting for Her American Suitor?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SANTIAGO -- Springtime is in full bloom here. The late-day sun glistens off melting snowcaps until nearly nine in the evening. Lovers dot grassy slopes in the park. Soon there might even be a big wedding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's been almost eight years since the U.S. told Chile that it would tie the knot in a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty, along the lines of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). Through two U.S. presidential elections, the collapse of a World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization (WTO) summit in Seattle and renewed U.S. protectionism in steel and agriculture, Chile has held out hope that America would eventually make good on that promise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Zoellick says the deal might be signed by year-end. Chile's director for multilateral economic affairs, Ricardo Lagos Weber, in an interview here this week echoed those sentiments. \"We still have differences,\" he told me. But, \"Yes, I think we can make it for December.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Small, remote Chile badly wants this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. But what may be less well understood is that the U.S. should want it at least as much, if not more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile's relatively open economy is heavily dependent on export growth; greater access to the U.S. market would be a boon. Despite U.S. farm subsidies that make it difficult for Chilean farm exports to compete, Mr. Lagos sees \"substantial\" benefits for his country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the U.S. the reasons to complete the agreement go well beyond access to Chilean goods and markets. The U.S. desperately needs a win in Latin America. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> expansion is one of the few productive and morally defensible tools to advance U.S. interests in political and economic stabilization in a region that is rapidly falling apart.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without a U.S.-Chile free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, Chilean modernization and openness would probably survive. But the rest of the region, which is already listing left toward renewed nationalistic populism, could read the failure of the deal as a sign of U.S. arrogance and indifference. This might revive the careers of dangerous demagogues in places like Peru and Argentina and could encourage in Brazil even greater levels of economic insulation than already exist. More destabilizing poverty would likely follow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Making good on its promise to let Chile into the U.S. free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club is a necessary first step in salvaging U.S. leadership in the region. As it stands now Latins are more likely to complain about U.S. hypocrisy -- be it on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or narcotics use -- than to defend American values, even though most instinctively prefer economic liberalism. Preaching open markets to poor countries while practicing protectionism in Washington has not only energized anti-American populists. It has hurt the advocates of economic freedom who are fighting the liberalization battle on the ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By any measure Chile has been badly treated by the U.S. Its strong rule of law, secure property-rights protection, impressive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> openness and stable democracy long ago qualified it as a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partner with the U.S. But after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was signed in 1994, the Clinton administration abandoned efforts to expand regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Fast-track negotiating authority -- which gives the administration the power to negotiate deals that Congress must then vote up or down -- expired in 1994. Democrats wanted any renewed fast-track to include labor and environmental provisions. Republican refused on grounds that this would shut out low-cost trading partners. The free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda died.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile may have been jilted but it did not stay home spilling tears over its fickle suitor. Instead it went ahead with its own free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda, while keeping open the possibility of a U.S. deal. This has turned out to be a brilliant strategy and one that would surely serve other nations in Latin America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undoubtedly the best thing Chile has done to advance its own prosperity is its unilateral tariff reductions. In 1998, while many of its neighbors decided to wait for the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas -- then at least seven years off, Chile rejected the reciprocity argument. That year it passed a law to reduce its uniform tariff by one point a year until it reaches 6% in 2003. Three agricultural products -- wheat, vegetable oil and sugar -- have higher levels of protection but the vast majority of Chilean imports fall under the uniform tariff structure. Chilean producers are now among the most innovative and competitive in the region. That's at least part of the reason why a visitor to Chile senses a quality of life infinitely superior to the rest of Latin America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile has also signed a number of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. In 1997 it made a deal with Canada, the results of which Mr. Lagos describes as \"fantastico.\" In 1998 it upgraded a narrow bilateral agreement with Mexico to a full-fledged <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. More recently it has negotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> openings with South Korea and a not-yet-ratified treaty that raises quotas with the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that President Bush has \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" -- an updated version of fast track -- there are real reasons for optimism. Chile has put labor and environmental issues on the table and both sides have pledged to respect their own local laws. We're not interested in being \"poor cousins,\" says Mr. Lagos. \"We will play by the same rules for dispute settlement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those rules are still being worked out but they will probably set an important precedent for the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda of the entire region. \"When you don't have one billion people, you don't have nuclear weapons, you don't speak English and you don't have money, the only thing you have are rules and you have to believe that the big chaps will play by the rules,\" says Mr. Lagos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can be hoped that those rules will not include the potential use of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions. Poor Chile will continue to have to deal with the runaway use of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in the U.S., which is bad enough.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In any case, the best strategy would be to treat the Chilean democracy with the respect it deserves. That means local labor disputes are up to Chileans. Chilean Socialist President Ricardo Lagos and his left-of-center coalition are now leading the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the backing of Chilean labor unions. If they want a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the U.S., America should applaud.</p>\n"}

Ackerman is editor in chief of the Mexican Law Review and director of the University Program on Democracy, Justice and Society at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should not underestimate the enormous symbolic and strategic importance of Wednesday\u00b4s meeting between President Trump and Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump was elected in 2016 on an explicitly anti-Mexican platform. He called Mexicans \"rapists\" and threatened to end the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) while pledging to build an \"impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall.\" In contrast, L\u00f3pez Obrador, as a presidential candidate, toured the United States in 2017 to express his solidarity with Mexican migrants threatened by Trump's draconian immigration policies. The Mexican leader called Trump a \"neo-fascist\" and presented international human rights claims against the White House both in the United Nations and at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once L\u00f3pez Obrador was elected president in 2018, the expectation was that the two heads of state would inevitably collide, ruining a long history of constructive bilateral collaboration. Surprisingly, Trump and the Mexican president have in fact gotten along exceptionally well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>L\u00f3pez Obrador made the first move. The Mexican leader could have easily used his political capital \u2014 after a landslide victory \u2014 to rally the masses against the bully in Washington. Instead, he immediately put pen to paper and wrote a letter to Trump in which he proposed \"a new stage in the relationship between Mexico and the United States based on mutual respect and the identification of areas of understanding and common interests.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump followed suit. Instead of railing against a new \"radical leftist\" president south of the border, he called the Mexican leader to congratulate him warmly on election day. Trump then immediately sent a high-level delegation to meet with L\u00f3pez Obrador\u00b4s transition team in Mexico City and quickly got to work to continue bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has of course continued to insult Mexicans and immigrants while applying pressure on the Mexican government to control the northern flow of migrants. But the president has not taken a single action against the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration or violated Mexican sovereignty \u2014 not a small feat given the White House's tendency toward neo-imperialist policies, such as with Venezuela and Iran, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The biggest risk to the bilateral relationship was the possible end of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Trump promised time and again to end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, calling it a \"job-killing failure.\" And L\u00f3pez Obrador, and the Mexican left in general, had for decades blamed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for ruining the countryside and fracturing national industrial policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico\u00b4s previous president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, salvaged negotiations in 2017 by succumbing to Washington's whims. He was desperate to avoid the collapse of the economy on the eve of the 2018 elections, since this would have ruined any possibility of his party keeping the presidency. But once L\u00f3pez Obrador won, the alarms sounded, since it was not clear how Trump would respond to a stronger president interested in defending his country's sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miraculously, the two presidents quickly cut a deal, and the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) was born. Both Trump and L\u00f3pez Obrador put aside ideology for a moment and worked together to hammer out a new version of an agreement that enables the increasingly integrated North American economy to grow and prosper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is the United States' third most important trading partner and the United States is Mexico\u00b4s first \u2014 $670 billion in goods of services cross the border each year. Neither country could afford to simply end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with nothing to replace it. Both sides therefore compromised on key issues, Mexico on domestic content of auto manufacturing, and the United States on Mexican oil sovereignty, all in the interest of regional development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had not been replaced with the USMCA, the prospects for an economic recovery after the covid-19 pandemic would be even more dire.

Fears that Trump will use the historic meeting to boost his reelection campaign or humiliate the Mexican president are misplaced. They underestimate the dignity and the political savvy of L\u00f3pez Obrador, who will insist on being treated as an equal and will not hesitate to defend the rights and interests of Mexicans on both sides of the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stark contrast between the politics and ideology of the two leaders only highlights the importance of the summit.

My support for the new deal in the coming weeks, and perhaps that of many of my Republican colleagues, will depend on the steps the president takes to strengthen it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the positive side, the USMCA enhances the current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with a new section covering digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, broader intellectual property-rights protections, and a ban on localized data storage requirements. The benefits of these improvements are unfortunately more than offset by the USMCA's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-limiting provisions. These include its expiration 16 years after it enters into force, continued use of Section 232 tariffs, severely limited investor dispute settlement protections, arbitrary wage requirements on auto and auto parts production, and numerous quotas on autos, steel, and aluminum, among other things.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To ratify the USMCA, President Trump faces a choice: make further <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-restricting concessions and hope they secure passage in a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats next year, or make pro<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> modifications in the implementing legislation and enact the USMCA under a Republican-controlled Congress before the end of this year. I urge him to choose the latter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Entrusting House Democrats with passing the USMCA is a dicey proposition, at best. Many of the newly elected Democrats ran on opposition to all things Trump, and the next House speaker will not prioritize passage of President Trump's signature <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> achievement. In addition, liberal constituencies are already panning USMCA. Environmental organizations are actively opposed. Labor unions are withholding support despite significant courtship from the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative. And key House Democrats are demanding changes that would undermine <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three countries -- and may even require reopening negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new Democratic majority in the House also might indefinitely stall passage of USMCA, goading the president into responding with the \"nuclear option\" -- a unilateral withdrawal from the existing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This would be disastrous for the American economy, and would kick off a constitutional battle between the branches over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To avoid this quagmire, President Trump should work with congressional Republicans to incorporate additional free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> features in the USMCA's implementing legislation so that it can be passed before the next Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3, 2019. These improvements wouldn't require reopening negotiations with Mexico and Canada. To preserve this option, the president, under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority rules, must submit the final text of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement to Congress before the end of this month. By doing this, the president would preserve the fast-track procedures of TPA, including a straight-up, simple majority vote requirement in the Senate. This procedural step does not commit President Trump to a strict timeline for passage of the USMCA. Rather it leaves open the option for congressional consideration this year or next.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Considering the USMCA before the end of this year would require a process more expedited than some of my colleagues would prefer. However, it may be the president's best shot at securing a vote on USMCA, and preserving the North American trading relationship. That is why I, and 11 of my Republican colleagues, sent a letter to President Trump late Tuesday, asking him to keep open the option of passing this agreement in this Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Trump chooses to pursue a USMCA vote in Congress this year, I will engage in a good-faith effort to work with his administration on implementing legislation that corrects the flaws listed above and that could pass Congress with the votes of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs like me.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Toomey, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: New <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Is One of Many Urgent Bills to Pass Quickly\" -- WSJ November 28, 2018)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Pat Toomey</p>\n"}
{"id": "2323282215.xml", "text": "<h2>The USMCA deal is a nice return to normalcy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IS GOVERNANCE still possible in Washington? Tuesday's announcement of a bipartisan deal that seems to assure eventual passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) surprisingly suggests that the answer might be \"yes.\" That, as much or more than the actual substance of this updated version of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, represents the true significance of the moment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To watch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a Capitol podium, surrounded by Democratic committee chairs, including her point man on the bill, Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) of the Ways and Means Committee, was to travel back in time to the days when legislation was still, as they say, a thing. To be sure, in recent weeks Ms. Pelosi seemed to be straining for reasons to oppose an agreement, negotiated by President Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, that addresses many long-standing Democratic complaints about the alleged harm to U.S. manufacturing workers caused by outsourcing to Mexico. Even if it was partly \u2014 or mostly \u2014 Kabuki, the speaker's extended show of reluctance was necessary both as a bargaining tactic with Mr. Lighthizer and as political cover for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-deal-skeptic labor unions in her party coalition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for substance, the 25-year-old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> needed updating in light of changes to global supply chains and e-commerce. Mr. Trump made it harder by extravagantly denouncing the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, to which hemispheric businesses had long since adapted, and by reopening sensitive provisions regarding how much domestic content autos must contain to qualify for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three countries. Still, in 2018, he and Mr. Lighthizer \"succeeded\" in adding new, stricter domestic-content rules, as well as a kind of minimum wage for Mexican autoworkers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The net effect is to impose more managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the hemisphere, not a freer flow of goods. However, because that conformed to a long-standing Democratic demand, it would have been inconsistent for Ms.\u2009Pelosi to sustain resistance to the measure once her party took the House majority back. She did manage to satisfy her caucus's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-deal skeptics by diluting intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical makers and by adding an arbitration mechanism to enforce higher labor standards in Mexico. Much has been made of the fact that she pulled this off while simultaneously spearheading the impeachment of the president, but that might have favored a compromise, since members of her caucus from swing districts in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-dependent states such as Texas badly wanted the USMCA as proof that they could take on the president and make necessary new laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump can now crow that he kept a campaign promise. Ms. Pelosi and her colleagues can do the same. Both will claim credit for helping to create jobs. The global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment environment still roiled by Mr. Trump's tariffs on China and others \u2014 and bracing for at least a temporary lapsing of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization's legal enforcement mechanism, brought about in part by Mr. Trump's policies \u2014 will benefit from a dose of calm. In Washington, just for a moment, it's politics as usual, or what used to be usual. Kind of refreshing.</p>\n"}

Former Argentine President Cristina Kirchner, maybe, but not Ch\u00e1vez.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argentine politician Axel Kicillof fanned the flames of those fears when he visited Mexico earlier this month. A former economy minister for Mrs. Kirchner, Mr. Kicillof today calls himself a Keynesian. But while working in the Kirchner government he was known for hard-left antimarket activism and fiery rants fomenting envy and hatred among Argentines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kicillof gave a speech titled \"How to confront neoliberalism and not die trying: Argentina, Mexico and the new conservative wave in Latin America,\" at the national university in Mexico City. But he also called on two powerful Mexican senators of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador's Morena Party and had meetings with government officials.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his team were serious about maintaining Mexico's image as a destination for capital, they would have ducked Mr. Kicillof when he came to town. That they didn't is reason to turn up the worry meter and pay greater attention to the trading relationships that link the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is still a free country and the right of Mr. Kicillof's hosts\u2014who happen to be among the country's most vociferous AMLO supporters\u2014to provide a platform in the public square for his ideas remains secure. But for a government that claims to want to prove its rule-of-law bona fides, the Kicillof visit looks like a foolish, self-inflicted wound.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to believe it was a misstep. An alternative theory is that the government brought in Mr. Kicillof to plow ground for the AMLO agenda\u2014a k a the \"fourth transformation\"\u2014which the Argentine praised during his visit. The kirchneristas left office in 2015 in shame, having destroyed the country. Center-right Argentine President Mauricio Macri is still struggling to steady the economy, and Mr. Kicillof has no intention of letting the crisis go to waste.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The symbolism embedded in the Kicillof visit isn't lost on investors. They know that Mexico has been working to modernize for a quarter-century and has made important progress. They also know that kirchernismo would drag it backward as it did Argentina.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is a wake-up call for the Trump administration. With international socialists putting Mexico in play, the appropriate U.S. response is to deepen engagement with its southern neighbor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only Mexico's wacky hard left could see Mr. Kicillof's legacy of no-holds-barred populism as successful because it irresponsibly expanded social programs. Mr. Kicillof was part of a disastrous Argentine agenda that ran up huge budget deficits, pressured the central bank to print money, and destroyed the country's investment profile. Mr. Kicillof preached against property rights and applauded debt default and the confiscation of foreign assets. Locals weren't off limits: Mrs. Kirchner nationalized private pension accounts in Argentine banks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his daily news conferences, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador can seem invincible. From his moral high horse he scolds the press, denigrates the entrepreneurial class, and scoffs at the law. But his power rests on his high approval rating, which is unlikely to be sustained if investors flee the country and the peso collapses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reality is recognized by the practical AMLO, and it is why, despite his disdain for market economics, he has so far been forced to respect the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which remains in effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't, as some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> skeptics suggest, a handout to Mexico. It is an economic and geopolitical tool that modernizers on both sides of the border have used for a quarter-century to advance and lock in gains in Mexican economic freedom. Retaining it, or passing President Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, is crucial to holding on to that progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is voluntary exchange that is not only mutually beneficial in economic terms but also facilitates the flow of ideas and goodwill between nations. Isolation, by contrast, creates the conditions in which demagogues gain power. By shoring up the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, Washington can help Mexicans beat back the dangerous left-wing populism that Mr. Kicillof represents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You wouldn't guess any of this from listening to President Trump's continual bully-pulpit assaults against Mexico as a trading partner, or by watching Congress dither over passing the president's updated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some hope emerged Friday, when the Trump administration</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>announced</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>it has come to an agreement with Canada and Mexico to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed last year.

As leaders of two of the largest dairy cooperatives in the Western U.S., we have some suggestions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, American negotiators should work hard to preserve the duty-free access to Mexico that U.S. agricultural products currently enjoy. Second, they should fight to gain meaningful access to Canada's dairy market, which was excluded from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> when the agreement was first negotiated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. produces more cow's milk than any other country, 24.6 billion gallons in 2016. American dairy companies employ nearly a million people, generating direct wages of $39 billion and an overall economic footprint of more than $206 billion, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is America's single largest export dairy market, with $1.2 billion in sales last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Dairy Export Council estimates that the U.S. provides close to 75% of Mexico's dairy products, which supports nearly 30,000 American jobs. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is working well for both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dairy exports to Canada, on the other hand, face extremely high tariffs. Moreover, in February Canada implemented a state-controlled pricing policy that pays Canadian dairy farmers more than 50% more for their milk, which drives dairy prices higher in Canada than in the U.S. Simultaneously, Canada undermines global markets for dairy proteins by exporting skim-milk powder far below the global price. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations present an opportunity to stop these unfair practices, and we applaud the Trump administration's commitment to this. Most of Canadian agriculture has already embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with great success.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But fixing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't enough to keep the American dairy industry globally competitive. The most significant opportunity for dairy farmers and product manufacturers is to expand international markets, but as the U.S. focuses on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, other countries are aggressively forging new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. These arrangements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, are providing America's competitors with preferential access to a growing middle class. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement, finalized earlier this month, is a perfect example.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is one of America's primary dairy competitors. Now it is using its free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to enshrine nontariff standards such as prohibitions on the use of generic food terms such as \"parmesan\" or \"romano.\" These standards block competitors from entering those markets. The EU has completed other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Canada and Vietnam, and it is negotiating with Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand are quickly expanding their global reach, announcing that they will launch free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the Pacific Alliance of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The agreement among the remaining nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to move forward without the U.S. is only the latest in a growing string of setbacks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's absence has essentially converted slow and overly cautious countries into the most urgent deal makers of modern times. In contrast to the Trump administration's sentiments, expressed during its recent Asia trip, the U.S. ought to re-engage proactively -- and do so quickly. How can America stand alone and watch the rest of the world systematically reduce its competitive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> access?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As leaders in American food and agriculture, we ask for no subsidies or special protections -- only a fair and level playing field. This country has the most sustainable and competitive agricultural system in the world, an enduring and natural advantage. Given America's ability to provide high-quality products and meet the growing demand for dairy, entering into fair and balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements is a win for everyone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Capable U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators are working hard on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, as they should be.

If anything, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> framework, having forced Mexico to keep its economic liberalization program on track, helped prevent an even worse crisis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's financial crisis was precipitated by the 40% devaluation of the peso last December. This was unrelated to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, which went into effect 12 months earlier. The peso's collapse was caused by mismanagement of Mexico's monetary and exchange policies by the government of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everyone realized when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was approved that Mexico's economy was not yet free. Despite the extensive economic reforms carried out by the Salinas government since 1988, Mexico's railroads, ports, electricity generation and petroleum and petrochemical industries remained under government ownership. Rigid labor laws discouraged investment and job growth. The economy was a regulatory jungle. Had Salinas pushed reforms more vigorously during his six-year term, private investors would have had more confidence in the stability of the country and might not have fled the Mexican market when the necessary belt-tightening began.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite Mexico's economic woes, President Ernesto Zedillo has pushed free-market reforms in recent months. Foreign investors now can own 100% of any financial institution. The government has put up Pemex's petrochemical plants for auction and is pushing plans to privatize the railroads and power utilities. A proposed law regulating the natural gas industry is expected to allow private investment in extraction and distribution. Zedillo also has announced a reform package designed to reduce burdensome regulation and to increase domestic savings and investment. Much more still needs to be done, but Mexico is moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It might not be moving at all without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. One of Mexico's foremost political analysts, Luis Rubio, director of the Center for Development Research Studies in Mexico City, says <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"is one of the few strong anchors that Mexico still has. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is keeping Mexico from losing all sense of direction.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Mexican economy starts growing again, as it inevitably will, the current U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit--caused by the peso's devaluation, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>--will turn into a surplus. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s potential was clearly demonstrated in 1994, when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Mexico jumped more than 22% to nearly $100 billion. During the five years before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect, bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had grown an average of only 12.5% annually.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The claim that more than 1 million U.S. jobs have been lost is way out of line. Economists use the widely accepted formula that every $1 billion in exports produces 20,000 jobs. If this formula is applied to the $8.5-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit reported by the U.S. Commerce Department for the first six months of 1995, 170,000 Americans may have lost their jobs this year as a result of the Mexican crisis. While that's nothing to be happy about, we should remember that 350,000 American workers file new unemployment claims every week. When the Mexican economy recovers, exports to Mexico will increase again, creating U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the argument that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has caused Mexican immigrants to flood across the U.S. border is preposterous. Mexicans have been migrating to the United States for many generations, and as Mexico's population increases over the next 15 years, from 91 million today to about 130 million, the number of Mexicans who enter the United States--both legally and illegally--will grow as well. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> creates greater economic opportunity in Mexico, those numbers will drop, not rise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-bashers are wrong on all counts. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the most important instrument America possesses for helping the achievement of an economically prosperous, politically stable Mexico. To do away with it now would be a terrible mistake.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: John Sweeney is a Latin American affairs analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based public policy research institute</p>\n"}
{"id": "429360273.xml", "text": "<h2>Running Scared From Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only one Democrat in the House from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut -- Nita Lowey, who represents parts of Westchester, Queens and the Bronx -- supports the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico. What accounts for the near-united opposition, even from such ardent free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs as Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Charles Schumer of Brooklyn?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most opponents profess anxiety about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s impact on the local economy. But in private, some admit that their opposition owes more to calculations of political survival than to judgments of economic merit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Local Democrats fear the wrath of organized labor. And well they should. As the accompanying table shows, labor political action committees contribute handsomely to their election campaigns. Though it's impossible to say just how much the PAC money explains opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, there's an unsettling pattern.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would eliminate tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among the three countries over 15 years. This would spur economic gains, but the primary benefit is political: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would lock Mexico into market reforms that could weaken the ruling party's authoritarian grip. Rejection would undermine Mr. Clinton's Presidency and his ability to negotiate other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on parts of the local economy could be beneficial. Some low-wage manufacturing jobs in the garment industry, for example, will be lost. But for every job lost to Mexican imports there will be at least one job created in export industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New York State exported over $1 billion worth of goods -- scientific instruments, chemical products, electronic equipment -- to Mexico last year, and that number will rise rapidly under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would also open up Mexico to U.S. banks, securities and telecommunications companies and exporters of management and other services, areas in which New York City excels. And the agreement provides strong protection for copyrights, patents and other intellectual materials -- exports that are vital to the current and future health of the New York City economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why, then, have almost all local Democrats turned their backs on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Besides the PAC money, labor's endorsement is often key to electoral victory in the New York metropolitan region. And labor hasn't been bashful about threatening to retaliate against representatives who stray on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.  In times of economic distress, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s potential victims, no matter how few in number, will know who these politicians are and blame them for any job losses. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s beneficiaries -- for example, the low-income families that would gain the most from low-cost imports of clothes and food -- are spread out all over the region, are less well organized and don't have anything as dramatic as their jobs at stake. And many workers have been convinced -- wrongly -- that their jobs are on the line, leaving politicians fearful that they will be blamed for every plant closing whatever the reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Democrats might have supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had they been backed early and hard by the White House. But Mr. Clinton started campaigning late. He didn't pressure Democrats to fall in line, so many declared themselves against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and can't now easily reverse course. But perhaps one or two -- as well as the many undecided Democrats and Republicans outside New York -- will decide to stand up to pressure and vote yes tomorrow.

{"id": "2413600172.xml", "text": "<h2>Editorial: Trump has his new NAFTA. But is it any better than the original?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's one thing you can say for President Trump's biggest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact so far: The new version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is better than the one Trump originally negotiated a year ago. House Democrats and the Trump administration announced a number of changes Tuesday that will make the agreement more enforceable, likely assuring its passage through Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once approved, the agreement will replace the 25-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a landmark deal that aimed to boost growth by leveling barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the continent. And while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did that, more than tripling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the countries, its benefits in the United States were offset in part by the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs to Mexico and some wage stagnation (although the blame for that may rest with globalization in general).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was overdue for an update that would hold Mexico to higher standards while also acknowledging the rise in online commerce. The original deal Trump struck does those things, and the changes negotiated with Democrats improves on them. The biggest downside of the latest version is that the two sides didn't change one major provision that pushed the new deal away from the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ambitions of its predecessor, and toward a costlier effort to manage <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the continent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not a huge surprise, considering that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs were largely absent from the negotiations between House Democrats and the Trump administration. Trump had proclaimed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a disaster that cost many Americans their jobs, and labor-aligned Democrats had opposed that pact from the start.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mere fact that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal with the House Democratic leadership in the middle of the Democrats' efforts to impeach the president is proof of Washington's ability to compartmentalize. And both sides had a clear incentive to get a deal done: Trump had promised during the 2016 campaign to end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as we know it, and House Democrats have come under withering fire from Republicans for allegedly focusing on impeachment to the exclusion of any other work. Although that wasn't true later this week, for example, the House is expected to pass a major bill to lower prescription drug costs and expand Medicare benefits the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal offered the chance to produce something tangible that wasn't likely to die in the Senate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, some liberal groups argued against striking any deal with Trump because it would help him politically without delivering the improvements to labor and environmental protections that they coveted. But that's ridiculous, given that the alternative Trump has threatened credibly, given his dislike of multilateral agreements is no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the main wins for the United States in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals it obtains is the pressure they place on our trading partners to raise their wages, working conditions, labor organizing rights, emissions regulations and other commercial and industrial standards closer to U.S. levels. There's no question that the revised version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada pact does a better job ensuring that those higher standards will be met than the original version did. That's to the Democrats' credit, as is the elimination of a provision that would have expanded patent protection for new biologic drugs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, the new version would still impose significantly tougher requirements on all automotive manufacturers in the region, requiring 70% of the steel and aluminum and 75% of the parts to be made in North America in order to avoid tariffs. The mandate will cost consumers, automotive industry workers or both because it disrupts the global supply chains that even domestic manufacturers rely on to make their products more competitive, and it imposes inefficiencies that automakers may seek to avoid simply by moving car production elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Happily, most of the provisions in the new agreement are copied either from the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal or from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump renounced after taking office, so on balance it should promote <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rather than hindering it. And clearly, the new version is better than Trump returning us to the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> status quo.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410200565.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade Distortions; Democratic candidates resort to far-fetched denunciations of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>POLLS SHOW that many Democratic voters are nervous about the potential impact of globalization on their job security. So some Democratic candidates are competing to validate every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-related anxiety and grievance, no matter how far-fetched. The campaign is turning into a contest to see who can make the most extreme denunciation of the nearly 14-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. In the Nov. 15 debate in Las Vegas, former North Carolina senator John Edwards called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"a complete and total disaster\" that has \"cost us millions of jobs.\" Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) claimed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had resulted in a net loss of more than 10,000 jobs in Iowa. Feeling the heat, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) has distanced herself from the agreement, which her husband pushed through a Democratic Congress. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> timeout,\" she now says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such demagoguery is worth matching against the facts about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s impact.  Among nonpartisan economists, the consensus (as summarized in a 2004 Congressional Research Service report) is that while the bulk of increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Mexico since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> probably would have occurred anyway, the agreement's positive effects have increased over time. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the current U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico ($64 billion last year, out of a $13.3 trillion U.S. economy). Nor did <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> cost the United States any jobs, on net, though it might have created a couple of hundred thousand. The agreement contributed marginally to the shifting of workers from some less competitive sectors to others. As for wages, a gap between higher- and lower-paid workers has indeed developed in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> years, but the main culprit is technology, which increases demand for highly educated and trained workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not that any of the Democratic candidates seem to care, but the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> seems to have been both larger and more positive in Mexico than in the United States. Mexico's gross domestic product, now more than $875 billion, has more than quadrupled since 1987. The poverty rate dropped 10 percentage points in the second half of the 1990s. Average wages have not grown and wage inequality remains a stubborn challenge, but pay grew most swiftly in the Mexican industries most exposed to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, according to the World Bank. And Mexico, once considered the sick man of Latin America, has logged its progress while also accomplishing a mostly peaceful transition to multiparty democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A final verdict on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not possible yet, because the  last deferred provisions won't be phased in until Jan. 1, just two days before Iowans go to the caucuses. Among them is the long-awaited elimination of all remaining barriers on American corn exports to Mexico.

{"id": "2213564805.xml", "text": "<h2>This Time, Get Global Trade Right</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans have watched their neighbors lose good-paying jobs as their employers sent their livelihoods to China. Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost nearly five million manufacturing jobs. In that same time, however, the prices that Americans pay for basic goods like T-shirts and televisions have fallen. The cost of clothing is down 8.2 percent since 1993, as \u201cmade in China\u201d and \u201cmade in Bangladesh\u201d labels have crowded out \u201cmade in U.S.A.\u201d on the shelves of the local mall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a national ambivalence about our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of goods and services with the rest of the world, which has more than doubled in the last two decades. Americans want the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \u2014 and they are potentially big and quite real, including opening up new markets to American cars and software \u2014 but they\u2019re increasingly anxious about the downside, which includes closed factories and lower wages. The country needs to pursue new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, but this time we need to get the agreements right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This page has long argued that removing barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefits the economy and consumers, and some of those gains can be used to help the minority of people who lose their jobs because of increased imports. But those gains have not been as widespread as we hoped, and they have not been adequate to assist those who were harmed. As the Obama administration negotiates two big <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements \u2014 one with 11 countries along the Pacific Ocean and the other with the European Union \u2014 it is appropriate to take stock of what we have learned in the 20 years since the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and use that knowledge to design better agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To gain the support of a divided Congress and public, the administration must ensure that new agreements are much stronger than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other pacts. President Obama, who criticized the agreement with Canada and Mexico as a candidate in 2008, promised that his negotiations would avoid a race to lower costs and standards by requiring that countries adhere to common regulations in areas like labor rights, environmental protection and patents. Living up to that promise should be one of his highest priorities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If done right, these agreements could improve the ground rules of global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, as even critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> like Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, have argued. They could reduce abuses like sweatshop labor, currency manipulation and the senseless destruction of forests. They could weaken protectionism against American goods and services in countries like Japan, which have sheltered such industries as agriculture and automobiles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pacific agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, could also encourage China, which is not part of the talks, to reconsider its currency and labor policies to avoid being at a disadvantage. (The participants are Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, Peru and Brunei.) And a pact with the European Union could harmonize overlapping regulations to reduce the cost of doing business and increase competition. Both pacts could aid American foreign policy by strengthening alliances in Asia and Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WELCOMING BUSINESS, NOT THE PUBLIC One of the biggest fears of lawmakers and public interest groups is that only a few insiders know what is in these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, particularly the Pacific pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration has revealed so few details about the negotiations, even to members of Congress and their staffs, that it is impossible to fully analyze the Pacific partnership. Negotiators have argued that it\u2019s impossible to conduct <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks in public because opponents to the deal would try to derail them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the administration\u2019s rationale for secrecy seems to apply only to the public. Big corporations are playing an active role in shaping the American position because they are on industry advisory committees to the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Michael Froman. By contrast, public interest groups have seats on only a handful of committees that negotiators do not consult closely.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That lopsided influence is dangerous, because companies are using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to get special benefits that they would find much more difficult to get through the standard legislative process. For example, draft chapters from the Pacific agreement that have been leaked in recent months reveal that most countries involved in the talks, except the United States, do not want the agreement to include enforceable environmental standards. Business interests in the United States, which would benefit from weaker rules by placing their operations in countries with lower protections, have aligned themselves with the position of foreign governments. Another chapter, on intellectual property, is said to contain language favorable to the pharmaceutical industry that could make it harder for poor people in countries like Peru to get generic medicines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another big issue is whether these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements will give investors unnecessary power to sue foreign governments over policies they dislike, including health and environmental regulations. Philip Morris, for example, is trying to overturn Australian rules that require cigarette packs to be sold only in plain packaging. If these treaties are written too loosely, big banks could use them to challenge new financial regulations or, perhaps, block European lawmakers from enacting a financial-transaction tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SEEKING THE REAL SOURCE OF JOB LOSS Could these agreements lead to further job losses and exacerbate income inequality in the United States? Many critics are legitimately concerned about more outsourcing of jobs, and there is no doubt that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, along with automation and financial deregulation, has contributed to income inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it\u2019s important to remember that our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-agreement countries, like Mexico, is much more balanced than our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China. Those countries buy more American goods and services than they would without an agreement, sending money and jobs back in this direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A study published last year blamed increased imports from China for 44 percent of the decline in manufacturing employment from 1990 to 2007. People who lost those jobs were more likely to stop seeking work or to find lower-wage jobs in other industries, suggesting that government programs to retrain workers hurt by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are inadequate. A second paper by the same scholars concluded that the negative impact of imports from Mexico and Central American nations with which the United States has agreements were \u201ceconomically small and statistically insignificant.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s easy to point the finger at <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements for job losses, but there is a far bigger culprit: currency manipulation. A 2012 paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit has increased by up to $500 billion a year and the country has lost up to five million jobs because China, South Korea, Malaysia and other countries have boosted their exports by suppressing the value of their currency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HOW TO WRITE A BETTER AGREEMENT The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements the Obama administration is negotiating provide a chance for the United States to press countries to stop manipulating their currencies. The administration appears to be afraid that raising the issue could scuttle the talks. It\u2019s time the administration stiffened its spine.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also needs to make clear to America\u2019s trading partners that they need to adhere to enforceable labor and environmental regulations. This would level the playing field for American workers and improve the lives of tens of millions of workers in developing countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration also needs to do much more to counter the demands of corporations with those of the public interest. Consumer and workers groups should have been on the same industry advisory committees. And Mr. Froman, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, must make clear that these agreements will allow countries to adopt regulations without the threat of a lawsuit from powerful businesses. On patents, the agreements should not cut off developing countries\u2019 access to lifesaving generic medicines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent months the debate about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and the Pacific agreement in particular, has become increasingly polarized. Senior Democrats like the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, have come out against granting the president <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority, under which Congress agrees to vote up or down on agreements without amendments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To a large extent, the administration has only itself to blame. By keeping secret so much information about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, which have ceased to be purely about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> matters like tariffs and quotas, the government has made itself a target for criticism. Mr. Obama and Mr. Froman argue that their critics have misunderstood or misrepresented their intentions. But that is precisely why the president should provide answers to the questions people have raised about these agreements. It is time for him to make a strong case for why these new agreements will be good for the American economy and workers.</p>\n"}

His main trouble has come from the Trumpian exceptions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, immigration and polarizing temperament that motivate many of his supporters. Whether he can overcome that seeming contradiction may determine whether he can win what on present trends looks like an uphill climb to re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Trump will no doubt tell Congress in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, his main achievement has been re-energizing what had been a long but weak and fading economic expansion. As the nearby table shows, the economy nearly dipped into recession at the end of 2015 and early 2016 before recovering to its 2% Obama-era trend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Growth accelerated in 2017 amid deregulation and especially the end to the Obama harassment of business. The GOP Congress and Mr. Trump repealed no fewer than 16 costly Obama-era rules. Growth accelerated again to more than 3% on an annual basis in 2018 after tax reform\u2014and may end up as the first calendar year above 3% since 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax reform was mediocre on the individual side, with tax credits that redistributed income but did nothing for growth. But the tax-rate cuts for corporations and pass-through businesses were aimed specifically at the biggest weakness of the Obama expansion: capital investment, which surged in 2018.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has led to productivity gains that should spur large wage increases if they continue. The labor market is as healthy as it's been since the mid-2000s and maybe the 1990s. Average hourly earnings in January were up 3.2% year over year, the workweek was up 0.5%, and overall employment rose 1.7%. With inflation heading below 2%, economist Ed Hyman calculates that real wage gains are already nearly 4%. So much for the claim that tax reform hasn't helped workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This economic progress fulfills the main promise Mr. Trump made to his working-class supporters, and keeping it going has to be his priority. With the Federal Reserve now \"patient\" on raising interest rates, the biggest growth obstacle is Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs have hurt some companies and industries willy-nilly, but the biggest harm has been the uncertainty of what comes next. Mr. Trump thinks car tariffs are \"leverage\" in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, but they are also a reason to delay investment until supply-chain and input costs become clear. Tariffs act like Obama regulation as an economic wet blanket, as numerous CEOs attest on their earnings calls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump can help guard against an economic slump in the next two years by stepping back from his 2018 burst of protectionism. First, get as good a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal as he can with China, declare victory, and spend the next two years monitoring how well Beijing abides by its terms. Second, withdraw the threat of car tariffs on Europe as he negotiates a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the European Union. The U.S. economy can't grow at 3% or higher if China and Europe aren't growing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal awaiting a vote in Congress. Mr. Trump will no doubt urge Democrats to support it on Tuesday, but he can't force Speaker Nancy Pelosi to do so. What he can control is whether to hurt himself and the U.S. economy by withdrawing from the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> pact, which is in force until the new one is ratified. Mr. Trump's threat to do so merely gives Mrs. Pelosi more reason to shelve the pact since she knows any economic harm will accrue to Mr. Trump as President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With an enhanced GOP Senate majority of 53, Mr. Trump can keep adding to another achievement\u2014judicial nominees who are remaking the federal bench in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We wish Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg well, but if illness forces her retirement Mr. Trump could cement what the last three GOP Presidents did not: an originalist majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time in decades.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Democrats running the House, Mr. Trump can't expect much legislation worth doing. All the more given the sharp Democratic left turn on economics and the culture. Democrats will try to tempt him into a tax increase in return for infrastructure spending, or perhaps the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal, but this would undermine the economic growth essential to have any chance at re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An immigration deal would be a signature achievement, if Democrats agreed. But to move them politically, Mr. Trump has to get off his Donald-one-note rhetoric of a \"border crisis.\" He has to frame the issue more broadly in a way that promises legalization for the Dreamers and others to put pressure on Democrats. He needs to offer an incentive for Hispanics to lobby Democrats to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Russia probe aside, a restrictionist-only immigration policy has done the most harm to Mr. Trump in the first two years. The early travel ban was a legal and political fiasco that cost him support; the family separation mess hurt Republicans in the midterms; and insisting on money for the border wall put him in a box canyon that led to his recent defeat over the government shutdown. Mr. Trump needs to make a bigger immigration offer to overcome that losing record.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump faces a difficult re-election despite his economic success because he hasn't expanded the coalition that elected him. The traditional suburban Republicans and independents who swung to his side in the final days of 2016 were willing to give him a chance rather than vote for Hillary Clinton. She won't be on the ballot in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats may give Mr. Trump a chance by running too far to the left, but voters may take even that risk unless Mr. Trump can point to prosperity and give more Americans more confidence in him personally. By now we've learned that last point is beyond our counsel.</p>\n"}

For President Clinton, the vote will test his, and the Democratic Party's, ability to shape major legislation. For the U.S., the vote will test its longstanding commitment to open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- the primary locomotive of world growth for a half-century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican and Democratic Administrations alike have urged Latin and South Americans to adopt market reforms and open their borders to U.S. exports. If the U.S. now rejects <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because it fears competition from an economy one-twentieth its size, it will look like the hemisphere's biggest hypocrite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The treaty would gradually phase out tariffs between Canada, Mexico and the U.S., creating a large open regional market, and would provide tight legal protection to foreign investors. The Administration says <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will produce an economic renaissance; critics say <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will destroy jobs, cut wages and damage the environment. The truth is, by comparison, prosaic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> create or destroy jobs? Neither. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> affects where in the U.S. people work, but not how many people work. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico will export more clothes, vegetables and brooms to the U.S. And the U.S. will export more automobiles, computers and computer software to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Employment will rise in some industries and fall in others but is likely to change little over all. That is because it depends less on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> than on the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board. If, contrary to predictions, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> leads to a flood of Mexican imports, and higher unemployment, the Fed can pump more money into the economy and push employment toward its original level.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> suck American industry south of the border to take advantage of low Mexican wages? Critics raise the specter of U.S. firms closing factories and fleeing to Mexico. Some companies will relocate, but the numbers won't be large. Mexico might attract about $15 billion in extra investment. But that's a small fraction of the $500 billion invested in plant and equipment every year in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican wages are low because the Mexican economy isn't very productive. They are not a huge draw for U.S. companies and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> does not make producing in Mexico any cheaper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are Mexicans too poor to buy U.S. goods? Ross Perot's demeaning sound bite is belied by the facts. Mexico is the third-largest buyer of U.S. exports and currently buys more goods from the U.S. than the U.S. buys from it. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would lower Mexican tariffs by a lot and U.S. tariffs, because they are already low, only a little. That means the price of U.S. goods in Mexico will fall enough to make U.S. exports more affordable to Mexicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will wages of low-paid workers rise or fall?  Many U.S. workers fear their wages (after accounting for inflation) will fall because they have done so for the better part of two decades. But the anguish is misdirected. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> explains only a tiny part of the trend and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> won't make matters any worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some U.S. companies will cut back employment as they relocate; and some Mexican exports to the U.S. will increase. On both scores, U.S. employers will cut wages to stay competitive. But this is only half the story. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will raise U.S. exports, and the U.S. industries that are likely to expand hire about as many low-paid workers as the U.S. industries that are expected to shrink. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s impact on wages will be negligible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Will <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> harm the environment? Most major environmental groups in the U.S. support <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. And for good reason. It explicitly protects U.S. environmental regulations and builds in a mechanism for sanctions if Mexico fails to enforce its own environmental laws, which are already strict. Critics charge that the agreement would invite U.S. companies to flee south to evade tough U.S. enforcement; but few U.S. companies spend as much as 1 percent of costs on compliance -- which is too small an expense to justify relocating in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't sound. But proponents should not dismiss the pain of those Americans -- probably a few hundred thousand over a decade -- who will be laid off. That amount of fluctuation happens month by month in a 120 million-member labor force. But to the victims, the problem is severe. The answer isn't to throw the entire economy into a protectionist straitjacket, but to provide ample retraining and education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After weighing the economic pros and cons, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> comes out slightly ahead. But the other stakes -- the vitality of the Clinton Presidency and the future shape of the U.S. relationship with Mexico and the rest of Latin and South America -- loom even more important. They are the reasons that Democrats, in the party of Bill Clinton, and Republicans, in the historic party of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, ought to vote yes.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1841700508.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico Reacts to the Trump Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the sharp selloff of the Mexican peso after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump were set to music it might sound like a funeral dirge, the dearly departed being the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). The peso has fallen to an all-time low of more than 20 to the dollar, and on Thursday the Bank of Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate to stem the bleeding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico investors are worried that Mr. Trump might actually believe -- as he argued in his campaign -- that U.S. productivity growth and job creation depend on renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to discourage U.S. investments south of the border. But Mexico won't easily yield to a new deal that limits its access to U.S. markets in order to make it less attractive as a destination for capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump counters with tariff hikes in violation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico is likely to respond with its own duty increases. It did this with $2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. export products in 2009 when the U.S. failed to live up to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligation in trucking. There is even the possibility that Mr. Trump will carry out his threat to tear up the agreement. There are no winners in any of these narratives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 23 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was launched, Mexico has cultivated a middle-class, a more-vibrant democracy and a diversified economy far less dependent than it once was on oil. The country now sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would be an economic disaster and open the door to political instability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus it won't be so easy for Mr. Trump to bully the neighbors. National pride will play a role in stiffening the Mexican spine, and President Enrique Pena Nieto's government is signaling that it intends to face any crisis by deepening structural reforms, getting its fiscal house in order and looking more aggressively for new trading partners. The unspoken message to Mr. Trump is that if he plays the protectionist game, Mexico is ready to raise the stakes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s demise would be bad for the U.S. too, although the U.S. stock market rally suggests that the fear of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war is overblown. Protectionist steel and textile tycoon Wilbur Ross is rumored to be in line for a job in the new administration. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r from Indiana, which in 2015 exported $4.8 billion in goods to Mexico, its second-largest export market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time Mr. Trump has had flashes of sanity on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In a joint press conference with Mr. Pena Nieto in Mexico in August, then-candidate Trump spoke of the need to \"keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some expect the Trump administration to find a way to largely leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone while it works on legitimate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues like China's practice of intellectual-property theft. Mexico seems to want to help in this face-saving endeavor and has wisely decided not to escalate the rhetoric. It doesn't need to: Americans have plenty to lose if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many U.S. corporations are now heavily invested in supply chains that crisscross the continent to create globally competitive products. These support millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Saying goodbye to duty-free access to Mexico under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also would hit U.S. agricultural exports hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters on Nov. 10 that his government is \"ready to talk so we can explain the strategic importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for the region. Here we're not talking about . . . renegotiating it, we're simply talking about dialogue.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also said Mexico will look for new markets, adding to more than 40 existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. It had hoped for expanded opportunities via the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that includes the U.S. and much of Asia. But President Obama wasn't able to get TPP through Congress and Mr. Trump has promised to kill it. Mr. Guajardo said that Mexico will pursue the possibility of completing a smaller TPP with the countries that are expected to have ratified it by the end of 2016. He named Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Australia would probably be eager to replace the U.S. as Mexico's chief food supplier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this would make up for the loss of U.S. market access under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which means that increasing Mexican competitiveness is urgent. Mr. Pena Nieto got historic constitutional reforms in energy and telecommunications through his Congress in 2013. Opening these markets to competition will attract capital and improve the infrastructure for producers but implementation takes time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately the government's debt burden has increased sharply in recent years and taxes have gone up, adding to disappointing economic performance.

From the industrial giants like Alfa and Vitro, to the midsize companies, right on down to the informal vendors, the costs of doing business in Mexico are increasing while projected earnings are falling. Official growth projections have been downgraded to under 3% for this year compared with projections of 4% made a year ago, and some worry that growth may be dead in the water.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Up until now, there has been little question about the current administration's commitment to strong growth. Since becoming president in 1988, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his economic team have embraced a plethora of supplyside growth initiatives, often in defiance of international \"experts.\" These initiatives included dramatic tax rate cuts, an opening to foreign goods and capital, deregulation of capital markets, massive privatizations and an opening for private investments in economic areas heretofor reserved for the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican market responded to these actions like desert flowers in a rainstorm. Private-sector investment bloomed. Capital markets and inflows from abroad surged. Formerly protected businesses learned to compete and found the resources to do so by joining the world financial system. Government revenue from tax receipts doubled, leading to the first budget surplus in Mexican history; and, in an atmosphere of strict monetary discipline, inflation did what all the Phillips-curve-critics of President Salinas's bullish growth strategy said was impossible: It decreased to a projected annual rate of 11% this year from 159% in 1987.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But several months ago, the economy turned wobbly. While officials were boasting in world forums about their budget surplus, Mexican firms were reeling at the enormous cost of capital at home. Lower growth projections increased the possibility that the peso was overvalued. Even the booming stock market became fickle, fluctuating wildly at the slightest indication of bad news at home or abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Mexico's growth slowdown began in the context of a world recession. But not all of Mexico's slowdown can be attributed to outside factors. The administration, while perhaps not actively suppressing growth, has momentarily made anti-inflationary goals paramount.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas doesn't put it exactly that way. \"We do not believe that you have to sacrifice growth in order to have lower inflation,\" said the president in an interview last month. \"But we are facing today a situation in which you can not sustain high growth due to the international situation. And since we are going through that transition we are taking advantage of that situation precisely to collapse inflation.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that many firms in Mexico, as well as foreign investors, see Mexico's need to grow as a more immediate concern. \"The number one concern of Mexican businesses is to remain competitive,\" says Alejandro Guzman, president of Monterrey's Coparmex, an industrial chamber. \"And that's not easy to do with the high cost of capital in Mexico now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not all analysts agree on the cause of Mexico's high cost of capital. Some bankers blame stringent requirements placed on their activities in March by the central bank. Most others blame Finance Minister Pedro Aspe's insistence on running an annual budgetary surplus, currently running at 0.4% of the country's gross national product.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One would expect such restraint more from the Bundesbank than from a Latin government. But what's right for developed Germany may not be right for a developing country like Mexico. Mexico needs to build infrastructure. And as long as the government maintains its commitment to strong growth and a strong currency -- a commitment that could be much enhanced by anchoring the peso to the dollar -- growth bonds could be issued to sustain the needed socioeconomic overhaul. But to do this, Mexico would likely have to give up its precious surplus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists David Goldman and Evan Kalimtgis from the New Jersey firm Polyconomics remarked on this in a report they published in September: \"Mexico's position resembles that of a young family which must mortgage future earnings potential in order to purchase a home. . . . A young economy, like a young individual, does not have a sufficient wealth buffer to sustain a drop in earnings.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Aspe appreciates the sentiment, but rejects the advice: \"If you were to ask me, `Pedro, structurally, for a country like Mexico, what would be the right policy?' I'd answer straight: a fixed exchange rate with a small fiscal deficit of between 0% and 2%. But we have not reached that level because: first, inflation is still very high; and second, because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't been passed. When these two things are locked up, then we can follow a more aggressive growth strategy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can well understand the Mexican government's concern about inflation and the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. But are these goals really jeopardized by a more adventuresome commitment to stronger growth? In fact, the greatest threat to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may well be slow growth. If exporters to Mexico, or potential joint venture partners, or even those speculative investors who view all of Mexico as a growth stock, perceive that Mexico is not doggedly committed to growth, their interest in the treaty will diminish.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for inflationary pressures in the economy, it's difficult to spot many rising consumer prices. Nevertheless, from the high cost of capital, land and managerial labor to the tremendously complex tax and regulatory codes, production costs in Mexico are as high as ever. \"If you take a Mexican company in the manufacturing industry with the same cost structure as a U.S. company, the tax burden for the Mexican company is substantially higher,\" says Desc's Mr. Medina-Mora. And since Mexican trading doors were opened, Mexican producers can't pass their costs on to a captive consumer; that consumer can now buy foreign. This cuts entrepreneurs' enthusiasm about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican firms are not looking for an artificial boost through an arbitrary lowering of interest rates or a devaluation of the currency. \"Most of us generally support the macro policies of the government,\" says Monterrey steel company owner Eduardo Garza. \"But it still takes months to start up a business in Mexico today. Many entrepreneurs simply give up in frustration or operate in the underground economy. The government must push harder to deregulate the economy and get rid of all the disincentives.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this area, help may be on its way. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> minister Jaime Serra recently announced a 12-point program of fiscal and regulatory incentives to boost the supply side of the Mexican economy. These changes compliment others that have been on line for several months, including: elimination of capital gains taxes for the transfer of properties; the ability to fully deduct in the first year all the present discounted value of an investment (excluding Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey); an overhaul of Mexico's antiquated port facilities; and hints that Mexico's strangulating labor laws (which hamper the flexibiilty of both workers and managers) may be overhauled as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the slowdown, Mexico still seems like a coiled spring ready to pop at 5% to 10% growth a year. President Salinas admits that \"we are capable of sustaining rates of 6% in real terms per year.\" But the longer the government keeps the spring coiled, the greater the chance that it loses its elasticity. The Mexican government has to take larger steps to prove to the U.S. and to its own people that it is seriously committed to releasing the juggernaut. If not, precisely those indicators that Mr. Aspe is waiting for -- passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and an inflation rate competitive with the U.S. -- may slip from its grasp.    ---    Mr. Asman edits the Americas column.</p>\n"}

Mexicans elected as their next president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a longtime leftist who has risen to power buoyed by much the same anger with the status quo that put Donald Trump in the White House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lopez Obrador\u2019s \u201cMexico first\u201d message to voters resonated deeply with a country fed up with previous administrations seen as elitist, corrupt and indifferent to the plight of the impoverished. Time will tell whether he can deliver on the lofty promises he\u2019s made, including a pledge to end all corruption, which he claims will generate billions of dollars that he will use to uplift the poor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His rhetoric about the U.S. \u2014 he would like to scale back Mexican imports of U.S. farm goods and promised to ensure his country\u2019s oil never falls \u201cback into the hands of foreigners\u201d \u2014 suggests potential for combative ties with the U.S. But Mexico\u2019s economy has seen anemic growth, and frosty relations with Washington would only worsen his country\u2019s economic doldrums.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Lopez Obrador would be smart to quickly find common ground with Trump, and collaborating on a reworked North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is the place to start. What tack Lopez Obrador will take on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn\u2019t known yet. Historically, he has been critical of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, though during the campaign he and his advisers talked of preserving it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s a good sign. Economic growth is a lot easier to forge with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Protectionism and tariffs shrink markets, and that\u2019s bad for both sides of the border. Illinois has particularly benefited from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In 1993, before the pact kicked in, the state exported less than $6.4 billion in goods to Canada and Mexico. By 2015, Illinois exports to those countries reached $26 billion, amounting to 41 percent of the state\u2019s total export output.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump, however, appears to be digging in for a fight. On Sunday, he said he wasn\u2019t happy with the shape of a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal that his team has been working on, and would rather wait until after the midterm elections in November before signing any agreement. \u201c<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, I could sign it tomorrow, but I\u2019m not happy with it. I want to make it more fair, OK?\u201d Trump told Fox News. Meanwhile, Canada on Sunday began imposing tariffs on American steel, aluminum, ketchup and beef in retaliation for Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum. As the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> battles burgeon, more American companies and farmers feel the bite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe Lopez Obrador can talk sense into Trump when they sit down for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks. Imagine if he\u2019s successful \u2014 a leader who\u2019s been likened to the latest Latin American iteration of the late Venezuelan leftist Hugo Chavez getting an American president to take the sensible path toward a reworking of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We accept that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which has been around since the mid-1990s, is due for an update.

The same is true for many electronics, and advanced textiles like carpeting. The beef in your grocery store might be from a cow that was fattened and slaughtered in the United States, but that was very likely born across the border in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is the world that has evolved in the almost 23 years since the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was enacted. These deep economic interconnections show why trying to unravel what Donald J. Trump, in last week's debate, called \"the single worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever approved in this country\" would be no easy feat. It would risk disrupting the very underpinnings of industries that employ millions of Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The view among mainstream economists is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, over all, has raised incomes in the United States while also costing it thousands of manufacturing jobs. But whether you view the agreement as a net positive or a net negative for the country, the reality is that the United States, Canada and Mexico are now for all practical purposes a single integrated economy. That has wide-ranging consequences -- especially if the next president tries to reshape or abandon the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the border between Santa Teresa, N.M., and the Mexican town of San Jeronimo, up to 5,000 head of cattle a day amble across the border; they are less likely to become stressed and lose weight when they walk under their own power than when loaded into semis. After being bred in the hills of Northern Mexico, and after eating American corn, they become a key input for the American beef industry. It creates jobs in feedlots and slaughterhouses in the United States, where the animals are fattened, and produces less costly beef for consumers in the United States and in the global markets to which the beef is exported.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few miles away, Mexican workers in a Foxconn facility assemble Dell computers that were designed in Texas and will be sold all over the world.

More complex parts like engines, transmissions and electronics components are more likely to be made in the United States or Canada, where the workers and suppliers with more advanced skills are in greater supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A transmission is a complicated piece of machinery and might go back and forth across the border three or four times as different components are added at different plants,\" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are parallels elsewhere in the world. In Europe, German manufacturing is extraordinarily successful on the world stage -- but many of the more labor-intensive, lower-value inputs for German cars and other manufactured goods come from lower-wage countries in the European Union like Poland and Hungary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's true that there have been fewer auto-making jobs in the United States since the introduction of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

Overall manufacturing employment in the United States is down 27 percent in the same span.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"There's this tendency to say, 'It's all moving to Mexico,' \" said Bernard Swiecki, a senior analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. But the center's research finds that automakers have spent $77 billion on new or upgraded capital projects in the United States since 2010, compared with $26 billion in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The improved competitiveness of American companies in the global auto market since the 1990s has happened in part because they have built more efficient North American supply chains. Different parts of the car are made in the place where the local labor force and cost structure are the best fit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If a product uses really sophisticated materials like high-strength steels and advanced composites, and more sophisticated processes,\" Mr. Swiecki said, there's a better chance you can find the people with the skills needed in the United States or Canada. Meanwhile, the lower price of labor-intensive parts imported from Mexico helps control the cost of the overall automobile and makes it more competitive with cars built in Europe or Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since the 1990s, major automakers based outside the United States have built American factories to gain access to these local supply networks and get closer to American consumers. That has to do with a lot more than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but the connections between North American parts suppliers across borders surely helped speed the process.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American auto industry is not the only sector where such a transformation has occurred, Mr. Hufbauer says. American textile companies make technologically advanced fabrics like those for carpeting, parachutes or the steel mesh inside tires. They are exported to Mexico, where the more labor-intensive work of turning those into finished goods is done. The same goes for many electronics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if you accept that these trends contribute to higher economic output, and to more high-income jobs and more competitive companies in the United States, it's not as if the anxiety about losing jobs that Mr. Trump describes doesn't have a realistic basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, it's fine to say that Dell is a more competitive, successful company by assembling computers in Juarez, which creates more high-paying jobs for the people who design and sell those computers. But that isn't much solace if you were one of the 905 people who lost jobs at the plant in Winston-Salem, N.C., doing that same work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, the narrative promulgated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> skeptics that a more integrated global economy has worsened job opportunities for certain workers isn't wrong. But it's also not a given that the trend will reverse itself if the next president does seek to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We don't know exactly what a President Trump would do in seeking to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, or what exactly the consequences would be of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war between the United States and its partners. And a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war could well erupt if he were to follow through on some of his aggressive statements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we do know is that even relatively small tariffs can stand in the way of the kind of supply networks on which many modern industries are based. With these networks, goods can cross back and forth across national borders multiple times as part of the pipeline that leads to a finished automobile or a computer or even a side of beef. It's not that companies couldn't adjust; over time they could. It's that the networks evolved this way for a reason, and readjusting would come at a considerable cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More fundamentally, trying to reject the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with America's neighbors entirely would mean upending major industries and a generation's worth of economic integration. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has had its flaws and downsides.

{"id": "398377445.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Will Pemex follow YPF to the auction block?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MEXICO CITY -- President Carlos Saul Menem seeks to burnish his and his Peronist Party's image by privatizing Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's state oil firm. Before the July 2 partial sell-off, YPF President Jose Estensorro had slashed the number of workers to 10,600 from 51,000, opened attractive fields to private operators, and staunched the seemingly interminable flow of red ink to post a $259 million profit in 1992. Investors rushed in to buy 160 million shares of the slimmer, market-oriented Argentine company, generating $3.04 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also has experience restructuring state assets in preparation for their privatization. The Mexican chief executive has returned the banking system to private hands and sold off hundreds of other state firms. In most of these cases the need to increase efficiency before the assets were privatized was emphasized. This has led some to speculate that the current economic restructuring of the oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), may be a preliminary step toward privatization. However, Pemex which generates 30.2% of the country's foreign exchange and 24% of the federal budget, has proved a tough nut to crack.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's acutely nationalistic Constitution mandates state ownership and exploitation of hydrocarbons. To privatize Pemex, President Salinas would have to amend this fundamental law. Such an initiative would spark a firestorm of protest from nationalists, who are already outraged by the Mexico-bashing engaged in by Ross Perot, Rep. David Bonior, Lane Kirkland, and other foes of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas therefore insists that \"ownership and control of oil remain unalterably in Mexican hands.\" Needless to say, he realizes that with or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico cannot vault into the developed world as long as Pemex remains a synonym for inefficiency, waste, featherbedding, and pollution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After an April 1992 gasoline blast killed more than 200 people in Guadalajara, the 45-year-old chief executive accelerated the restructuring of the monopoly. The revamping, presided over by Pemex Director-General Francisco Rojas and Operations Director Adrian Lajous, resulted in the creation of four subsidiaries: Pemex-Exploration and Production (E&P), Pemex-Refining; Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals; and Pemex-Petrochemicals. Each unit is expected to become a profit center. As such it must take charge of its own budget, planning, personnel, and other functions. Near arms-length contracts and market-based (but still managed) transfer prices govern intersubsidiary transactions. \"For the first time,\" a Pemex official confided, \"we will learn just how much it costs to refine a barrel of oil at any of our half-dozen refineries.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eventually, representatives of Mexico's private auto, glass, transport, and chemical industries should be added to the subsidiaries' governing boards to provide a business perspective on Pemex operations. The current all-public sector composition of these boards prompted one puckish observer to exclaim: \"Pemex's new organization suffers from greater incest than the Inca royal family!\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the jury is still out on the \"New Pemex,\" several improvements are impressive, especially those accomplished by Pemex-E&P. Industry-watchers anticipated that this subsidiary -- which absorbs 58% of Pemex's $3 billion investment budget -- would resist change because of its size, nationalistic sensibilities, tradition of stressing volume produced over profits, and hostility toward the economists, accountants, and other technocrats who are so ubiquitous in the executive suite. But Manuel J. Ortiz de Maria, the 62-year-old petroleum engineer who directs E&P activities, has plunged into the whirlpool of reform without losing his bearings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even before the Guadalajara disaster, Pemex-E&P decentralized its operations by shifting desk-bound engineers and geologists into the field. And soon, E&P's central office will move out of Mexico City to Tabasco state, away from political pressures and closer to the action. Mr. Ortiz de Maria also has carefully studied the managerial techniques of domestic and foreign firms that hold service contracts to drill up to 24 wells in Campeche Bay. Attentiveness to the contractors' work has enabled Pemex to pare its drilling costs by one-third. This has helped enable the E&P division to register a 50-million-barrel increase in reserves. After eight years of decline, Pemex reported holdings of 65 billion barrels on January 1, 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pemex's marketing boss, an astute 41-year-old, cigar-puffing economist named Pedro Haas, now performs a cost-benefit analysis on every transaction in which it is involved. By stressing profitability, this initiative has saved Pemex money in 1990 ($50 million), 1991 ($70 million), and 1992 ($100 million).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And of course, Messrs. Salinas and Rojas broke the back of the mafia-like Oil Workers' Union with the January 1989 military action that ousted its egregiously corrupt leader. Since the putsch, Pemex has slashed its labor force to 116,000 workers from 210,000 -- with more pink slips expected this year. A new collective contract permits the state corporation to seek the lowest bidder for maintenance, transport, slop oil disposal and other work formerly guaranteed to venal, graft-ridden labor chiefs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new emphasis on efficiency has led to some dramatic new business arrangements which would have been inconceivable three or four years ago. Early this year, Pemex began a $1 billion joint venture with Shell Oil. In return for providing 100,000 barrels per day (b/d) of heavy Maya crude to Shell's upgraded Deer Park, Texas refinery, Mexico will receive 45,000 b/d of unleaded gasoline by 1995.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More market-driven advances may occur. On Aug. 4 the business daily El Financiero published a leaked report of President Salinas's plans to permit private companies to construct and operate natural gas and refined product pipelines. The documents, dismissed as \"apocryphal\" by Pemex, proposed converting the monopoly's exclusive pipeline network into a common carrier for third parties. It also recommended liberalizing imports of gasoline and industrial fuels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such hopeful developments aside, the nationalistic shackles from which President Menem has broken free still impede the introduction of sweeping rather than incremental reforms at Petroleos Mexicanos. While Pemex is more efficient than it was before Salinas's inauguration nearly five years ago, the granddaddy of all restructurings -- an Argentine-style privatization -- remains unlikely at least during this presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grayson teaches government at the College of William & Mary.</p>\n"}

Talks aimed at salvaging the Doha round of negotiations have fallen through, with no agreement among the United States, Europe and the major emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil. To be sure, this was always a long shot. India and China had brought the Doha round to a screeching halt last summer by insisting on protecting their farmers through tariffs that the United States  could not accept. And it was never terribly likely that the gap could have been bridged during the waning days of the Bush administration, much less  when the  global economy is gripped by uncertainty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even a successful Doha round would have yielded modest benefits to global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Still, its demise is regrettable both substantively and symbolically. Precisely because economies are in retreat around the world, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is more important than ever as an engine of recovery and growth. This is no time to hand the forces of protectionism any sort of victory. The World Bank recently forecast that world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which grew 6.2 percent in 2008, will shrink by 2.1 percent in 2009  --  the first such contraction since 1982. Capital flows to developing countries could drop by half, the World Bank predicted. At the same time, the International Food Policy Research Institute has reported that the failure of Doha could cut world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by $1 trillion, because it might prompt countries to abandon the voluntary tariff restraint they have  exercised.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President-elect Barack Obama needs to reassure Americans and U.S.  trading partners around the world that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will be part of his plan for U.S. economic recovery. If his campaign for the White House had a weakness, it was the mixed signals he sent in this regard. Mr. Obama frequently acknowledged the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but he just as frequently denounced specific agreements, including the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he made an ill-advised pledge to renegotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama's party is, of course, deeply divided between protectionist constituencies such as organized labor and pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> technocrats such as those who populate his economic team. Mr. Obama's apparent first choice for the key job of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative,  Rep. Xavier Becerra (Calif.), embodies Democrats' ambivalence. He voted for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, then later repented; he opposed a similar deal for Central America and the Dominican Republic; he favored a pact with Peru and opposed one with Colombia. As it happens, Mr. Obama's record looks pretty much the same. (The vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came before he was elected to Congress.) The only person who can clear up the confusion over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is the next president himself, and we hope he'll take the first opportunity to do just that.</p>\n"}

Or so it seemed until last week, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) trashed President Obama's request for authority to expedite major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-expanding agreements with the Pacific Rim and Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not a bullish indicator if the man who controls Senate business says, \"Everyone would be well advised just to not push this right now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protectionists appear to be gaining traction with their attacks on the proposed pacts, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which \"could mean toxic food and environmental contamination,\" according to a scary video on the AFL-CIO's Web site.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The critics' central claim is less lurid: The TPP would destroy U.S. jobs and wages -- just as its \"model,\" the 20-year-oldNorth American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), allegedly did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former Democratic congressman David E. Bonior of Michigan assembled anti-TPP talking points in a Jan. 30 New York Times op-ed: \"Mr. Obama's desire for fast-track authority . . . clashes with another priority in his [State of the Union] speech: reducing income inequality.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is generally beneficial, on net, to all sides. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with low-wage nations, though, can push down net incomes for workers in directly competing U.S. industries. This \"Stolper-Samuelson effect,\" as economists call it, is probably one of many hard-to-quantify factors that increased income inequality in the United States -- offset, of course, by the benefits to previously impoverished people abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to opponents' implications, however, the TPP would not expose the United States to major new competition from foreign low-wage labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bonior misleadingly described the TPP as a \"12-nation pact with Latin American and Asian nations.\" Actually, four of the 12 -- the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- are high-wage, developed nations neither Latin American nor Asian. Three others are Asian but decidedly high-income: Singapore, Japan and tiny oil-exporting Brunei.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States already has bilateral free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with six of the TPP nations -- Canada, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Chile and Peru -- and runs <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses with the last four. These countries account for 80 percent of U.S. merchandise <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the TPP area. So for that huge segment, the deal represents a mere tweak to the status quo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, the TPP includes Malaysia, a middle-income country (per-capita income slightly higher than Mexico's) and Vietnam, the only very-low-wage economy in the agreement. Both countries would indeed have improved access to U.S. markets in return for more access to their markets for U.S. business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same goes for Japan, by far the largest non-U.S. economy in the TPP. The deal is the best chance in a generation to open that country's notoriously closed market to U.S. agricultural and service exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, what little additional low-wage competition the TPP imposes on the United States is likely to be offset, at least partially, by improved U.S. market access.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What of the notion that the TPP is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> redux and that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> devastated American jobs and incomes?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't believe that hype. Bonior blames <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for the $181 billion combined <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit between the United States and its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But $100.7 billionof this deficit is because of oil imports, according to U.S. government <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> statistics. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has nothing to do with this; Canadian and Mexican oil imports always flowed freely.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, the $181 billion figure leaves out almost $90 billion worth of goods that entered this country from elsewhere and then got re-exported to Mexico or Canada. Such \"re-exports\" are normally included in official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> statistics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Omitting re-exports is valid if you want to emphasize that producing them did not create jobs for U.S. workers, which is the critics' point. Still, the U.S. re-export numbers are so big that they suggest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- or something -- has encouraged a shipment business that employs, and pays, a lot of Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hard data are maddeningly elusive, but economist Michael Ferrantino of the World Bank, who has studied the subject, told me that re-exports could be worth $50 billion in annual income for the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eliminating oil and including re-exports produces a U.S.-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> surplus of roughly $7 billion in the goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In services, the United States enjoys robust surpluses with both Mexico and Canada -- a total of $43.7 billion in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond its economic impact, the TPP is crucial geopolitically;it's a key component of Obama's \"pivot to Asia,\" whose goal is to counter the rise of China and commit the region to U.S.-style reciprocal free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rather than Beijing's mercantilist model.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it works, the result would be a more stable Pacific region, with all the benefits, economic and otherwise, that entails. The usual suspects are fighting hard against the TPP. Is Obama prepared to fight just as hard for it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p>\n"}

In the perception of some Americans, including a significant number of Democrats, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a cautionary tale, invoked today as a warning that similar deals will harm the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is unfortunate on two counts. First, comparing the substance of current negotiations to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, an agreement reached at the end of the Cold War and the dawn of globalization, is like comparing the latest smartphone to an early Macintosh desktop. The 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement being hammered out by the administration is more sophisticated, comprehensive and user-friendly than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was in its day. It would also connect the United States to a much larger global network. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Michael Froman is negotiating a state-of-the-art agreement, and Obama has advanced persuasive arguments for both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority he needs to seal the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s legacy is more positive and instructive than its ardent critics recognize. Reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to a caricature obscures both its achievements and some valuable lessons - good and bad. As part of the White House team that helped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> become a reality, I think its record over the past 20 years can contribute to the current debate and to larger questions about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the United States's role in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which was negotiated under President George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, united the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Today, Canada is our largest export market and Mexico is the second largest. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in North America has increased by 400 percent, passing $1.1 trillion per year. More U.S. exports go to Mexico than to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain combined. We export more to Canada than to the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The successes went well beyond the balance sheet, however. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted U.S. security and regional stability. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is a powerful instrument of geopolitics, binding us to our allies. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> smoothed more than a century of friction in U.S.-Mexico relations. It was a catalyst for opening Mexico's economy and its political system; within a decade, the country ended generations of one-party rule. Mexico is today undertaking reforms that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. The success of a North American platform in energy and manufacturing has yielded diplomatic and security cooperation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> cemented ties with our neighbors and showed that the United States would not turn inward after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Trans-Pacific Partnership can be an essential bonding agent in our relations in Asia. It is a crucial sign of our engagement with a region where China seeks to assert more influence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sharpest criticism of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that it caused U.S. job losses and lower wages, a concern painfully reflected in the hardship of workers who saw jobs go overseas. The rise of the global economy, advances in technology and other factors have transformed the American workplace. How big was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s role? Economists disagree. Assessing its overall economic impact, a report last month by the Congressional Research Service issued a split decision: \"In reality, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, despite significant growth, does remain a relatively small part of the total U.S. economy. Still, evidence suggests net job creation and more high-wage jobs created in the process. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, around 14 million U.S. jobs depend on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, with nearly 5 million of those jobs due to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> increase generated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disruptive power of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a reality we can't ignore. It brings benefits and costs. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> helps keep inflation and consumer prices low. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted productivity through competition. On jobs, the lessons of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argue for a holistic approach to education and training assistance for employees along with infrastructure and other investment. The profits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must flow not only to shareholders but also to workers. Notably, agreements in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on labor and the environment were handled in \"side letters\" drafted after negotiations. Now, they are being baked into the deal-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a rare bipartisan triumph. Congress approved the measure with a Republican majority and more than 100 Democratic votes after exhaustive persuasion by Clinton. \"It's never fun passing a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill in this town,\" Obama said last week. But it is a critical test of leadership for both the president and the country. As in 1993, bipartisan support is needed not just to muster enough votes. It sends a clear message that the United States will not turn inward from the realities of the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements are a long-term wager on the future.

{"id": "434056665.xml", "text": "<h2>A Small and Dangerous Spat</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has been warning that tit-for-tat protectionism could drive the world into an even worse economic slump than it is already in. He is right. Unfortunately, Congress doesn't seem to be listening.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The $410 billion spending bill that Mr. Obama signed into law last week cuts off financing for a pilot program that allows Mexican trucks to deliver goods across the United States. The move clearly violates the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which promised -- starting in 2000 -- to open cargo transport throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada to carriers from all three countries. This week, Mexico retaliated, leveling tariffs against $2.4 billion worth of American imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both the United States and Mexico must be careful. A full-fledged fight could threaten more than $350 billion in annual commerce between the two countries. That is clearly in nobody's interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An arbitration panel ruled in 2001 that the United States was in breach of its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligations on Mexican trucks. But thanks to the Teamsters union and its allies in Congress, all but a small number of Mexican carriers are restricted to operating within a 25-mile band from the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truck drivers' argument that Mexican trucks are unsafe is spurious --  a flimsy cover for protectionism. Data from the Department of Transportation show that Mexican trucks and drivers operating in the United States -- along the border and in the pilot program -- have a better inspection record, with fewer violations, than their American counterparts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has so far shown a worrying ambivalence about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. He has called for renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, creating anxiety in both Ottawa and Mexico City -- claiming that this can somehow be done without harming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. While he managed to persuade Congressional Democrats to water down a \"Buy American\" provision in the fiscal stimulus package, he did not get them to pull it altogether.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We understand the White House did not want to threaten the passage of the spending bill by raising a ruckus over Mexican trucking, a comparatively minor issue. But it is time for Mr. Obama to put some political muscle behind his declared support for open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He can start by persuading Congress to revive the truck pilot program or start a new one. And he must make clear that -- sometime soon -- all properly inspected Mexican trucks must be able to work throughout the country, as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires. That would not only solve this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> spat, but it would provide the world with needed reassurance that the United States will stand by its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements in these difficult times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

In the years immediately after the global financial crisis, rising incomes in China had helped it claim the top spot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Beijing has spent the past five years actively diversifying imports to ensure it won't be too dependent on any one trading partner -- particularly a strategic rival. U.S. agricultural exports to China in 2017 were worth nearly 25% less than they were in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Falling prices for many farm products have pushed down the value of U.S. agricultural exports to Canada, too, but only marginally: Shipments in 2017 were still at 93% of their 2014 peak. It is difficult to argue that Canada in aggregate is giving U.S. farmers short shrift.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ironically, there is one key sector where Canada represents a real competitive threat to U.S. industry -- oil and gas. Ottawa has long been a significant petroleum exporter, and would love to grab a big piece of the rapidly growing Asian liquefied natural gas market, where China is a dominant buyer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's policy mix is simultaneously raising construction costs for U.S. oil-and-gas infrastructure by pushing steel prices higher and alienating both of America's largest trading partners -- one of whom is a major energy and agricultural exporter, and the other the world's largest energy and food consumer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Don't be surprised if U.S. energy producers and farmers end up holding the bag.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Nathaniel Taplin</p>\n"}
{"id": "293329246.xml", "text": "<h2>PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY; Migration Could Be a Modern Twist on Manifest Destiny; The U.S.-Mexican War was part of our westward expansion; 150 years later, Mexicans see similar opportunity.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week marked the 150th anniversary of a turning point in U.S. and Mexican history. Depending on your point of view, the timing couldn't be better for national interests--or it couldn't be worse. For it was on May 13, 1846, that the United States declared war on Mexico to secure the annexation of Texas, parts of which Mexico still claimed. The war ended Feb. 2, 1848, with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the United States acquired not only Texas but also California and most of the magnificent land in between.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So for the next two years, people on both sides of our southern border will be continually reminded of what was probably the most successful, wrong and inevitable war this country ever waged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was successful because it led to the largest territorial expansion in the nation's history, rivaled only by the Louisiana Purchase.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was wrong (the word used by Abraham Lincoln, who opposed the war as a young congressman from Illinois) because it was waged against a weak, peaceful neighbor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was inevitable because of a visionary concept whose resonance has faded over time, but which meant a great deal in 1845, early in the presidency of James K. Polk: Manifest Destiny. That was the popularly held notion that it was the destiny of the republic to expand across North America, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not politically correct for a Mexican American like me to admit it, but I think the proponents of Manifest Destiny were right. Not in their methods, to be sure. (I'm with Abe Lincoln on that.) But Polk and his compatriots cannot be faulted for moving to seize and exploit what the European explorers and their descendants on this continent considered virgin territory. If the United States had not claimed the lands formerly under the Spanish crown, one of the 19th century European powers probably would have.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every point I've made so far is, I readily concede, arguable. Rest assured that they will be debated over the next couple of years. For now, I only hope that the history of relations between the United States and Mexico is recalled and talked about in constructive terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that people in both countries are better educated and have access to sophisticated media of all sorts, it should be easier to put many patriotic myths that grew out of that era into a more realistic perspective. As I wrote 10 years ago when Texas celebrated the sesquicentennial of its independence, the Battle of the Alamo was not a one-sided struggle against hopeless odds, as Hollywood has portrayed it many times. On the Mexican side, Los Nios Heroes (the Heroic Children), six military cadets who died fighting the U.S. Marines who captured Mexico City in 1847, may not have been all that young or heroic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People of goodwill on both sides of the border must also be prepared to counter the alarmist rhetoric that is sure to be heard in both countries before this sesquicentennial ends.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico-related issues like illegal immigration and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement are already political hot-buttons this election year. So expect to hear conspiracy theorists in full Cassandra-like fury claiming that Mexico is using illegal immigrants to reconquer its lost territories, or that Wall Street is using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to take control of Mexico just as it controls the U.S. government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Myths, whether rosy or scary, whether of the past or the present, may help some people deal with the harsh complexities of everyday life. But they will get us nowhere in trying to advance the dialogue between two large \"distant neighbors\" that must live with each other because, for better or worse, they need each other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without immigrants from Mexico, the economies of California, Texas and the other former Mexican territories--not to mention the economies of U.S. cities as far from the border as Chicago and New York--would not be nearly as prosperous as they are. And without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico would not have been able to ride out its latest financial crisis as well as it has.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the more thoughtful proponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argued for it on the basis that it was no more than a trading system to better regulate a process that was already well underway: the integration of the Mexican, Canadian and U.S. economies as goods and capital flow more freely across international boundaries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I would push that argument further: It is only a matter of time before all three nations take the next logical step and create a system to better regulate a migration that is also well underway: the movement of young Mexicans northward to work while U.S. and Canadian entrepreneurs and retirees head south to prosper in warmer climes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some writers have called this migration one of the inevitable global \"megatrends.\" Fair enough. But here's another way to look at it: Is economically motivated migration just a continuation of the economic expansion that 19th century Americans called Manifest Destiny? It's a question worth pondering over the next couple of years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...)

{"id": "1688353209.xml", "text": "<h2>On Trade Deal, Nafta Is the Wrong Cautionary Tale; China's accession to the WTO points to what can go wrong with free trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics of the 12-nation Pacific <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal pushed by President Barack Obama have repeatedly criticized it as \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on steroids \" in pointing out what can go wrong with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in comparing the Trans-Pacific Partnership  to the 1994 pact with Mexico, critics may have picked the wrong target. It isn't the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement but China's accession to the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 2001 that offers the cautionary tale to legislators who will likely vote again this week  on whether to give Mr. Obama authority to complete the TPP.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With both Mexico and China, the U.S. hoped not just to benefit from more exports but to encourage reforms in those countries and to strengthen geopolitical ties. Of the two, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came closer to filling that promise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics note that the U.S. went from a small <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico in 1994 to a deficit of $30 billion, or 0.3% of total economic output, in 2000. But that had little to do with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The year after it went into effect, Mexico suffered a severe financial crisis, and the peso crashed. The depreciation and ensuing recession caused Mexican imports to plunge. Once the peso stabilized and Mexico emerged from recession, the surplus persisted, but against the backdrop of large, and growing, two-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Cross-border investment and supply chains grew significantly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which also included Canada, did cost some American workers jobs or pay. But on net, both Mexico and the U.S. were better off as a result, though it is difficult to prove given the diversity of influences on both countries' growth, the small size of Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relative to U.S. and the many obstacles to development Mexico's poorer households still face.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the economic payoff of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was likely modest, the political benefit wasn't. The Mexican government saw <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"as a means to institutionalize the new liberalized policies and signal that they will be long-lasting,\" recalls Aaron Tornell, a Mexican government official in the early 1990s who now teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles. It has largely retained that policy framework, though successive governments were slow to broaden and extend the reforms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The experience with China was initially similar, with President Bill Clinton declaring in 2000 that its entry in the WTO would spur economic openness and \"strengthen the rule of law.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China used the WTO as a spur to overhaul inefficient state-owned enterprises and introduce market-based changes, which helped propel a remarkable rise in Chinese living standards. With the threat of higher tariffs significantly reduced, Western firms set up shop in China to export products back to the U.S., and imports from China boomed. American workers suffered on a far greater scale than they did from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico. One study concludes increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China cost more than two million American jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to China grew quickly but are far from enjoying the success they have had in Mexico. The U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with China ballooned from $83 billion in 2001 to $268 billion in 2008, a whopping 1.8% of U.S. economic output. Last year, U.S. exports to China were just 27% of imports; the comparable figure for Mexico is 82%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several factors limited the success of U.S. producers in China. As with Mexico, one was a cheap currency. But unlike Mexico, China kept its currency down as a deliberate policy to bolster exports and suppress imports, enforced through capital controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And unlike Mexico, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization with China didn't produce a broadly more liberal economic and political regime. The liberalizing impulse that surrounded WTO accession started to fade around 2006. China largely adhered to its WTO obligations, but it found multiple avenues to subsidize domestic enterprises and discriminate against foreign firms. China became more politically repressive at home and confrontational with its neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given how low U.S. tariffs already are with most TPP countries, its impact would likely be far smaller than with either <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or China's WTO accession. Nonetheless, there are lessons. One is that the impact of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement can be swamped by other factors, such as currency policies. Defining currency manipulation without compromising legitimate monetary policy is probably still too difficult to insert into TPP. But it's a good reason to be wary of admitting China for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second lesson is to take promises of noneconomic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization benefits with a grain of salt. To be sure, those countries who want to use TPP to liberalize their economies should be cheered on. But whether they ultimately succeed will depend less on the treaty and more on each country's political priorities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Greg Ip at greg.ip@wsj.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "1892894020.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump says he won't shred NAFTA. Here's what he should do instead.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S moods about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> continue to swing. He went out of his way to bash the five-year-old free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal between the United States and South Korea, irritating that ally at precisely the same time he needs Seoul's cooperation against North Korea. On the other hand, Mr. Trump decided not to withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, partly because the leaders of Canada and Mexico asked him politely not to, and partly because, as he put it, such an announcement would have been a \"pretty big, you know, shock to the system.\" Instead of shredding the 23-year-old pact, Mr. Trump will renegotiate it. Thank heaven for small favors -- though in fact the administration had already telegraphed this pragmatic departure from the president's strident anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> campaign rhetoric a month ago, in the form of a leaked draft letter to Congress setting out a (relatively moderate) agenda for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks with our northern and southern neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement of intent to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would indeed have disrupted settled expectations upon which depend hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and millions of jobs. In bowing to that reality, Mr. Trump tacitly concedes the tariff-slashing pact is not the \"disaster\" he repeatedly claimed, but something we cannot easily do without. In fact, it has been a generally, if modestly, positive force for growth and modernization in the U.S., Mexican and Canadian economies, whose diffuse benefits to Americans, in terms of expanded exports and lower prices for a wider range of goods, have been offset locally by job losses and other concentrated costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for renegotiating it, the Obama administration actually included some tweaks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Canada and Mexico in the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump abandoned before it could take effect, calling it even worse than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. For example, the TPP would have allowed U.S. dairy exports into Canada's notoriously protected market -- precisely the issue that caused Mr. Trump (and Democrats from dairy states, too) to lash out at Canada this month. A new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiation might also be the opportunity finally to settle long-running, if mostly overblown, U.S. lumber industry complaints over Canadian imports, which Mr. Trump has also embraced of late.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond reinventing that particular wheel, Mr. Trump's negotiators may also focus on the domestic-content rules governing the automotive industry in North America. Small and inefficient at the time of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s signing, Mexico's booming car-assembly factories now supply 30 percent of all U.S. auto imports. Autos and auto parts sold tariff-free within the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> area must be at least 60 percent made in the United States, Canada or Mexico, according to the agreement. But that norm could usefully be tightened, both as a policy matter and as the political price of greater U.S. support for the pact overall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What decades-old relationship couldn't benefit from a bit of a tune-up? If that's all Mr. Trump has in mind for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, after all his huffing and puffing -- if his newfound pragmatism is for real -- then Canada and Mexico can and should be willing to engage. If his change of attitude is just temporary, however, no amount of good faith from our partners can salvage hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Now Hillary Clinton's campaign aides are decrying \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>gate,\" claiming that Barack Obama is not really opposed to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal he so frequently attacks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They cite a memo from a Canadian consular official claiming that in a meeting, Obama's chief economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said his rhetoric, as the official paraphrased, \"should be viewed as more about political positioning than a clear articulation of policy plans.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Goolsbee denies saying anything to that effect. But it would be a relief to know that someone in the campaign -- starting with the candidate -- is thinking it.

A 2003 report by the Congressional Budget Office found it has boosted the output of both the United States and Mexico. Since Goolsbee is a first-rate economist, we doubt he is telling Obama anything different.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, the accord has served to open up foreign markets to American companies while reducing prices for American consumers. It has also proven good for most workers: Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings, which declined in the decade before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect, rose in the following ten years. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't deserve all or even most of the credit, but it hasn't been the scourge often portrayed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary Clinton is an odd one to accuse someone of being two-faced on this topic. After all, it was during her husband's presidency, and with his support, that the treaty was ratified. As recently as 2004 she made it clear she grasped its value. \"I think on balance <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good for New York and America,\" she said, while indicating she had some reservations as well. Now, of course, Clinton insists she never liked it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves only John McCain to stand up and defend the agreement, whose enactment helped foster the prosperity of the 1990s. The Democratic attacks only confirm the party's short-sighted drift toward protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse yet, Clinton and Obama have put themselves in a position where, if elected, they will be under pressure to take destructive steps to placate the anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> groups to which they have pandered. In last week's debate, Clinton promised to withdraw from the accord unless our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners agree to substantial changes. Said Obama: \"I think actually Sen. Clinton's answer on this one is right.\" This even though he had earlier said that he wouldn't scrap the accord because \"to actually reverse it would result in even more job losses, not gains.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the candidates have trouble keeping their stories straight, maybe it's because there is a clash between political expedience and economic wisdom. Some observers see the whole competition to denounce <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a ploy by cynical politicians who will discard their campaign promises as soon as the polls close.

The accommodating Canadian Embassy nonetheless tried to smooth things over yesterday with a statement saying that \"there was no intention to convey, in any way, that Senator Obama and his campaign team were taking a different position in public from views expressed in private, including about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Which is too bad, because the apparent revelation that Mr. Obama doesn't believe his own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rhetoric is the best news we've heard about the Illinois Senator's economic policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mr. Goolsbee's defense, we too have recognized a language barrier separating the U.S. and Canada, particularly when we enjoy watching NHL games on television. In their understated manner, Canadian analysts describe blows to the head as \"messages\" and sticks to the face as \"taking liberties.\" So perhaps Mr. Goolsbee's obligatory nod toward the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was interpreted in Canada as a passionate defense of free markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, if the Chicago professor was in fact sending a signal that Mr. Obama does not really intend to destroy America's largest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship, we can only say, \"Kick save, and a beauty!\" Leaving <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone would be great news for Ohioans in particular, as the Cato Institute's Daniel Griswold recently noted in these pages. Canada and Mexico buy more than half of Ohio's exports, and since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s 1993 enactment the U.S. economy has added a net 26 million new jobs. The average real hourly compensation (wages and benefits) of workers has climbed 23% and real median household net worth has increased by a third.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We suspect Mr. Goolsbee knows all of this, because the benefits of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are one of the few things that economists of the left and right agree on. The Commerce Department reports that while countries with which we enjoy free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements generate only 7.5% of global GDP, they consume more than 42% of U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And along with importing our products, countries seeking open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with America are also required to embrace the rule of law as a condition for such agreements. Colombia's inspiring progress shows that foreign policy benefits may exceed even the economic gains. But a rejection of the pending Colombian free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, a rewrite of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and a literal embrace of Mr. Obama's campaign rhetoric would send a disastrous signal over our borders, north and south. Here's hoping Canadian officials heard Mr. Goolsbee correctly the first time.</p>\n"}

But the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement\u2019s risk of stalling or rejection in Congress is high \u2014 and if that happens, it\u2019s the American people who stand to lose most.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are digging in their heels. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists there will be no vote until Mexico changes worker protection laws, and her Democratic majority would relish dealing the White House a humiliating blow. Making matters worse, some Republicans have serious concerns about the USMCA\u2019s <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> restrictions. The GOP congressional caucus has recently been increasingly emboldened to challenge the White House on foreign-related issues, such as Syria, North Korea and NATO.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is too much at stake for Congress to play a game of chicken with Trump on the USMCA. If the new treaty goes down, the president will not hesitate to officially abandon <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> entirely.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Congress rejects the USMCA to force additional changes, or stalls the vote until after the 2020 elections, Trump could officially withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement without a backup plan, winning him the dramatic and divisive news coverage he craves as well as adulation among his most fervent supporters. And don\u2019t expect anyone in his administration or his advisors to rein him in. The White House Council of Economic Advisors failed to even mention the USMCA in its assessment of key drivers of growth over the next few years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A no-deal scenario could be catastrophic. The USMCA is the best opportunity available to preserve free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with our neighbors and crucial economic partners. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect in 1994, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has quadrupled with Mexico and Canada, which are also the top destinations for exports from small and medium-size U.S. businesses. Casting aside what is essentially just an altered version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a Brexit-like replay, observers are sounding the alarm on the risk of a hard exit from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. If the USMCA replaces <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, our baseline economic growth will stay about the same. But a sudden ending of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be devastating. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Partnership Worldwide, a research firm, estimated last year that withdrawing from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with no replacement could eliminate 1.8 million to 3.6 million mostly blue-collar jobs in the next few years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Failure to pass the USMCA will also damage U.S. credibility on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> just when it is needed most. Upcoming talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping are crucial to successfully ending the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with China, which has hit American farmers hard. The inability to ratify or implement a major Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal will have inevitable negative consequences on the U.S.-China negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion \u00bb</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The potential damage to U.S.-Mexico relations is incalculable. That <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Partnership Worldwide report also notes that a no-deal situation would put 2.3 million to 10.3 million Mexicans out of work, potentially reversing the dwindling Mexican immigration numbers of the last decade. Notwithstanding Trump\u2019s rhetoric and criticism, Mexico is a trusted U.S. partner in reducing immigration, fighting drugs, cooperating against transnational crime and containing international terrorist groups. Imagine what happens if that cooperation ceases.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is room for improvement in the USMCA. But this issue is not the right one to test the ego of our president and his commitment to campaign promises. Nor is it the time. With U.S. elections around the corner, whatever bipartisan coalition that could possibly be mustered today will vanish in 2020\u2019s electoral noise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress should treat the USMCA as a necessary stopgap to preserve free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the continent from a White House that is unusually hostile to cooperation with our most important economic partners. It\u2019s up to Congress to ratify the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement and prevent a no-deal crash out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Schechter was the founding director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Latin America Center.

{"id": "398367435.xml", "text": "<h2>Politics &amp; people: More than peanuts: How to get Nafta passed</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The great debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is going something like this.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Glenn Poshard, an Illinois Democrat, opposes the treaty unless the \"corn broom industry\" problems are alleviated. His Midwestern colleague, James Barcia of Michigan, sees <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as threatening auto jobs and has \"asparagus concerns\" too. Down South, Terry Everett, an Alabama Republican, is negative for three reasons: \"cotton, peanuts and tobacco.\" Staffers for Georgia Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney are direct, noting that since businesses didn't help her get elected she owes them nothing \"unless they contributed to her campaign.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These comments, from a recent private survey by USA <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the big business lobbying group for the pact, capture the essence of the debate and show why the treaty with Canada and Mexico is in such trouble.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the vote were held today, it would lose by 30 or more votes. But this is reversible; there are a couple of dozen legislators who could be turned around. Two examples: freshman Democrats Carolyn Maloney, representing Manhattan's Upper East Side, and Rep. Anna Eshoo from California's Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the treaty won't pass as long as these micro issues dominate the dialogue. All politics may be local, and money unfortunately is the mother's milk of congressional decision-making. But to win, President Clinton has to elevate the debate in the next seven weeks and spell out the dire consequences of failure. That's the point being made by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), who is expected to argue in a speech today that this treaty is the \"test case\" of the U.S.'s ability to face up to the \"transformation\" of the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, however, the myths about why this agreement is in trouble have to be dispelled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is that this reflects the awesome power of organized labor's opposition. Labor just as adamantly fought for the BurkeHartke protectionist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill in the early 1970s, common-situs picketing in the late 1970s, and mandatory domestic content for autos in the early 1980s. Labor clout then was indisputably greater, and yet each time it lost decisively. Labor looks more powerful now because it has been operating in a vacuum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another myth is that the opposition reflects entrenched incumbents protecting narrow interests and constituencies; some term-limits advocates even claim that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would pass easily if there were term limits. But, according to the USA <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> count, 44 freshman Democrats oppose the treaty with only seven in favor and 13 undecided. This is far more negative than the count among more senior Democrats. These freshmen are, as the late Frank Thompson labeled an earlier group, \"bedwetters,\" constantly fretting about the prevailing political winds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real problems for the agreement are fears and insecurities that are legitimately gripping\" most middle Americans, as President Clinton acknowledged. These average folks feel the rich were taken care of in the 1980s and they were passed by. That <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is so overwhelmingly supported by the elites makes them all the more suspicious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's task is to hammer away that expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> invariably leads to more, not fewer, jobs. Wall Street Journal polls clearly show that if people think it's a job gainer, they become overwhelmingly pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House finally has gotten its act together in the past several weeks. The president privately is persuading some lawmakers; expect some vote-shift announcements soon. The administration has shrewdly targeted Nov. 17 for the House vote. That may be the last big vote of this session, and with Bill Clinton now having put his prestige squarely on the line it makes it harder for Democrats to vote against him. An added element is that the vote is scheduled for only days before the president goes to Seattle to meet with Asian leaders; international summits always are convenient backdrops for successful congressional actions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to some reports, Bill Clinton not only isn't ambivalent but privately is passionate about this agreement. \"This business about him being half-hearted is really a bum rap,\" says Rep. Peter Hoagland, a Nebraska Democrat, whom the president lobbied last week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Bill Clinton dislikes confrontation. Thus at an AFL-CIO speech this week he pulled his punches and didn't, as urged, call on labor leaders not to make this a litmus test, a stance that would have put them on the spot. Between now and Nov. 17, however, more direct confrontation is essential. One possibility under consideration: a town meeting in a heavily unionized area where the president can address and assuage workers' real worries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Proponents also have to take on Ross Perot. The USA <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> survey shows that Republicans as diverse as Elton Gallegly of California, Mel Hancock of Missouri, North Carolina's Howard Coble and Ohio's John Kasich (who should know better) express concern about the Perot factor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what the president and others chiefly must do in the ensuing weeks is seize the high ground, stressing that open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> means more jobs and embodies the American can-do spirit. Protectionism is backward-looking and defeatist: Usually it doesn't wear well. In 1985, for example, Democrat Jim Chapman won a hotly contested special election in East Texas that Democratic leaders said was fueled by protectionist sentiments. Today, the same Rep. Chapman is viewed as an almost certain pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, the implications of rejection have to be driven home. The Europeans, and especially the Japanese, surely would zero in on the Mexican market. With U.S. credibility damaged, any deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> would be jeopardized. The risk then of a world-wide turn to more protectionism would be real. And Bill Clinton's presidency would be badly wounded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fundamental question here, as President Clinton said, is whether we \"embrace\" or \"resist\" change. If this is the focus -- instead of peanuts, brooms, asparagus and even campaign contributions -- <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be a winner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---    If the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement were passed, would you agree or disagree that:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some jobs would be lost in the U.S. but even more jobs would be created.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agree ............................................... 40%    Disagree ............................................ 50%    Not sure ............................................ 10%</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> resulted in some U.S. industries being hurt and jobs lost, but more new jobs created:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Would you favor or oppose the passage of the agreement?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Favor ............................................... 69%    Oppose .............................................. 21%    Not sure ............................................ 10%</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</p>\n"}
{"id": "1878714159.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta Has Made Mexico a Better Place</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One common beef with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is that 23 years after it went live Mexico remains a developing country. Because Mexico's standard of living is still below that of its northern counterparts and a weak rule of law persists, critics argue that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet in this analysis the fault lies with the expectations, not the outcome. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was never going to convert Mexico into a Spanish-speaking Switzerland in one generation. On the other hand, few would have predicted the civil, political and economic achievements of the past two decades. That this has happened while American drug consumers have been financing vicious organized-crime networks in the country is even more impressive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the news in January that Ernesto Canales, the anticorruption czar in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, had jailed former Gov. Rodrigo Medina of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on charges of corruption during his term from 2009-15.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting a powerful member of the PRI behind bars, even temporarily, was a first for the state. Mr. Medina was released the next day by a federal judge on a procedural technicality but he still faces trial on corruption charges that could result in a sentence of up to 36 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter the outcome, Mr. Canales told the Mexican media, politicians are now on notice. Making a play on words in Spanish with the Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" he warned that Mexico's \"100 years of impunity\" are over.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago Mexico was a one-party state run by the PRI. The authoritarian machine, which had been in power since 1929, had industrialized the country and kept the lid on civilian lawlessness much like Gen. Francisco Franco did in Spain from 1939-75. But the corporatist model, in which the state owned or controlled business and labor organizations, held the nation back. Fiscal mismanagement spawned successive bouts of devaluation and hyperinflation. A repressive state apparatus contained social unrest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the 1980s Mexico looked more like Egypt -- poor, backward and undemocratic -- than like a member of Western civilization. Democratic capitalists on both sides of the border wanted change. But as the \"Arab Spring\" demonstrated, the transformation from tyranny to liberty requires more than desire.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political reform was not on the agenda when PRI President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in 1988. But the economy was in bad shape, and renewed growth depended on opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Canada. President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to pursue a continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment treaty with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and brought commitments to competition, privatization and foreign capital. Cross-border commercial relationships required improvements in civil law. For the first time in more than six decades, Mexico had the fundamentals of a market economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mexican economist Luis de la Calle and political scientist Luis Rubio show in their 2010 book, \"Mexico: A Middle Class Society,\" today's consumption patterns indicate that the nation is no longer \"poor.\" But this is about more than an increase in creature comforts for a wider number of Mexicans. It is also about the spread of middle-class values in education, civil rights and culture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption went unacknowledged in old Mexico because graft was a party entitlement, the press was controlled by the state and whistleblowers were easily ruined. But 6 1/2 years after the birth of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the PRI lost executive power at the ballot box.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Journal's Jose de Cordoba and Juan Montes reported earlier this month, some state politicians read the end of PRI dominance at the federal level as merely the decentralization of corruption. But they didn't count on how civil society, which had been neutralized during PRI autarky, also awakened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015 Jaime Rodriguez, a political outsider with no party, was elected governor of Nuevo Leon on a single issue: ending corruption. He named Mr. Canales to head an independent office, inside the attorney general's office, to investigate corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit to the state capital of Monterrey in February, I met with seven members of the Canales team. They shared with me some of their findings, including what they allege was a sophisticated scheme of \"simulation,\" in which chosen contractors created duplicate billing for infrastructure projects during the Medina term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite a federal prohibition on the right to subpoena state records, Mr. Canales's office collected enough evidence to charge, among other things, that Mr. Medina's administration signed thousands of overpriced public-works contracts with favored companies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Medina maintains his innocence. The trial is expected in the second half of this year.

Despite Mr. Trump's rhetorical flourish -- \"they used to call it <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" -- and the fact that he has portrayed any agreement with Canada as separate, it appears that any deal won't be too different from the trilateral one that has been in place since the 1990s. Investors were justifiably relieved seeing Mr. Trump, who had threatened to tear up the deal, reach an agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Markets are also happy about Monday's announcement because nothing is changing anytime soon. The need to involve Canada and the Mexican presidential transition mean a comprehensive deal won't be approved by Mexico until December at the earliest. That will almost certainly push U.S. approval into 2019, when a new Congress will have a say.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That isn't to say that the measures agreed upon are purely symbolic. If written into the existing treaty, the proposals will increase costs for companies that have been among the biggest beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It would require car companies to manufacture at least 75% of an automobile's value in North America, up from the current 62.5%. And it would require a set proportion of auto components be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But compared to the more dire possibilities -- that Mr. Trump would pull the U.S. out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or, lacking congressional approval of that, impose high tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods that would render the agreement obsolete -- the possibility of renegotiation counts as a relief. The mesh of supply chains that have emerged in the 24 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> first went into effect are staggeringly complex, and disrupting them could cause serious economic damage. Instead of requiring the deal to be renegotiated every five years, a widely panned idea, the agreement will last for 16 years and can be renewed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's symbolic victory Monday is vastly preferably to a pyrrhic one in an actual <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war. Investors' positive reaction makes sense.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Justin Lahart and Spencer Jakab</p>\n"}
{"id": "1893109519.xml", "text": "<h2>From tear-up to tune-up</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S moods about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> continue to swing. He went out of his way to bash the five-year-old free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal between the United States and South Korea, irritating that ally at precisely the same time he needs Seoul's cooperation against North Korea. On the other hand, Mr. Trump decided not to withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, partly because the leaders of Canada and Mexico asked him politely not to, and partly because, as he put it, such an announcement would have been a \"pretty big, you know, shock to the system.\" Instead of shredding the 23-year-old pact, Mr. Trump will renegotiate it. Thank heaven for small favors - though in fact the administration had already telegraphed this pragmatic departure from the president's strident anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> campaign rhetoric a month ago, in the form of a leaked draft letter to Congress setting out a (relatively moderate) agenda for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks with our northern and southern neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement of intent to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would indeed have disrupted settled expectations upon which depend hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and millions of jobs. In bowing to that reality, Mr. Trump tacitly concedes the tariff-slashing pact is not the \"disaster\" he repeatedly claimed, but something we cannot easily do without. In fact, it has been a generally, if modestly, positive force for growth and modernization in the U.S., Mexican and Canadian economies, whose diffuse benefits to Americans, in terms of expanded exports and lower prices for a wider range of goods, have been offset locally by job losses and other concentrated costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for renegotiating it, the Obama administration actually included some tweaks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Canada and Mexico in the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump abandoned before it could take effect, calling it even worse than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. For example, the TPP would have allowed U.S. dairy exports into Canada's notoriously protected market - precisely the issue that caused Mr. Trump (and Democrats from dairy states, too) to lash out at Canada this month. A new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiation might also be the opportunity finally to settle long-running, if mostly overblown, U.S. lumber industry complaints over Canadian imports, which Mr. Trump has also embraced of late.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond reinventing that particular wheel, Mr. Trump's negotiators may also focus on the domestic-content rules governing the automotive industry in North America. Small and inefficient at the time of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s signing, Mexico's booming car-assembly factories now supply 30 percent of all U.S. auto imports. Autos and auto parts sold tariff-free within the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> area must be at least 60 percent made in the United States, Canada or Mexico, according to the agreement. But that norm could usefully be tightened, both as a policy matter and as the political price of greater U.S. support for the pact overall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What decades-old relationship couldn't benefit from a bit of a tune-up? If that's all Mr. Trump has in mind for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, after all his huffing and puffing - if his newfound pragmatism is for real - then Canada and Mexico can and should be willing to engage. If his change of attitude is just temporary, however, no amount of good faith from our partners can salvage hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "419944019.xml", "text": "<h2>One more time: Gephardt revives a losing strategy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) has a theory of how to become president. It starts with being the most protectionist candidate in the Democratic field, which he hopes will lead to his endorsement by the AFL-CIO, lifting him to victory in the primaries and the general election. But if it were such a great plan, Gephardt wouldn't be running. He'd be writing his presidential memoirs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He tried this approach in 1988, campaigning on a bill to punish countries that ran <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses with the United States. But after winning in Iowa, with the advantage of being from neighboring Missouri, he soon fell out of contention. The guy who beat him in the Democratic primaries, Michael Dukakis, was strongly in favor of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. So was the guy who beat Dukakis in November, George Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In presidential politics, the only thing worse than not getting the AFL-CIO's endorsement is getting it. The last two candidates to get its blessing early in the race were Walter Mondale and Al Gore, neither of whom spent the following four years being serenaded with \"Hail to the Chief.\" Bill Clinton won even though the labor organization didn't get behind him until he already had the 1992 nomination sewn up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The support of organized labor would be nicer if it didn't force a candidate to take positions that alienate so many other Americans. Gephardt has already gotten the endorsement of both the Teamsters and the United Steelworkers. But pandering to labor, though it may help him now, will probably doom him once actual voters get involved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The AFL-CIO endorsement wasn't enough to save Mondale in 1984, when union members made up 19 percent of all workers. Since then, organized labor's share has shrunk to 13 percent of all employees-- and just 9 percent in the private sector. Gephardt, who brags that he has been fighting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for 20 years, is offering top dollar for a dwindling asset.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mondale lost partly because he was perceived, fairly or not, as the slavishly obedient son of Democratic special interests. Gephardt makes Mondale look like the soul of independence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is a make-or-break issue with unions, which regard imported goods the way Californians regard earthquakes. Most Americans, however, don't share that fear. To the contrary, they like being able to buy a range of economical products from all over the world, and they understand that foreign competition makes American companies more efficient and more attentive to consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, protectionist appeals usually fizzle at the polls. In 1988, Bob Dole thought he could beat George Bush in the South Carolina primary by denouncing textile imports, which competed with South Carolina companies. But locals apparently didn't care that much about South Carolina's fabric industry: They preferred Bush by more than 2-to-1. It turns out the state has a lot more people who buy textile products than people who make them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-bashing was supposed to be a winner in 1992, thanks to a weak economy. It didn't turn out that way. Nebraska Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey got nothing out of a campaign ad in which he stood in front of a hockey net threatening to keep out Japanese imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Republican side, veteran xenophobe Pat Buchanan gave President Bush a scare in New Hampshire, but the threat evaporated once voters started paying attention to what he was saying. He didn't win a single primary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ross Perot, running as a third-party candidate that year, bitterly opposed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. He got 19 percent of the vote in November. That sounds impressive until you consider that Clinton and Bush, both of whom endorsed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, got a combined 80 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Perot, Gephardt wants Americans to strike back against foreigners who insist on selling us things we want. But if fear of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't work in 1992, when Japan was seen as an unbeatable rival, it certainly won't work now, when Japan is an economic invalid. Back then, Americans worried that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> might send all our jobs to Mexico. Today, we know it didn't, and won't.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may not be a coincidence that the Democratic Party enjoyed its greatest success, from the 1930s into the 1960s, when it was the champion of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Republicans eventually abandoned protectionism and have been winning presidential elections ever since. Michael Barone, the principal author of \"The Almanac of American Politics,\" says the last time a protectionist party was the majority party nationally was in the 1920s, when high-tariff Republicans reigned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Memo to Gephardt: Just because it worked for Herbert Hoover doesn't mean it will work for you.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: schapman@tribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Presidential hopeful Rep.

But shock waves from the all-too-likely implosion of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement will be quickly felt all across the Pacific, with damaging economic consequences not only for Asia but for its largest trading partner, the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Washington debates the importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in terms of its impact on blue-collar jobs, environmental regulation and domestic politics, the far larger ramifications of the treaty's impending demise to the entire global trading system are being overlooked both in the U.S. and among its Asian trading partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The danger: If an alliance of American protectionists can defeat a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty with a next-door neighbor with whom America enjoys a healthy <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus, the logic is almost inexorable that the next targets of emboldened protectionists will be the distant Asian nations with whom America has the largest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits -- Japan and China. Japan's recession and China's recent decision to slow economic growth to damp inflation mean neither country is likely to import more from America soon. And if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars ensue among the globe's three largest economies -- the U.S., Japan and China -- fallout will poison economies on every continent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, if an American homeowner is willing to casually bludgeon the next-door neighbor, with whom he shares a common front yard, what self-restraint will prevent his mugging less familiar residents down the road?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ironically, these potential Asian victims, caught up in the hubris of their own economic miracles, seem remarkably oblivious to the mugging that may lie ahead. In their myopic view, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has long been seen as giving an advantage to Mexico at their expense in the critically important U.S. market. So the initial Asian reaction to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s troubles is relief. But this jealousy of Mexico has merely served to blind them to larger dangers. If Mexico is jilted, Asia is much more likely to be abused than embraced by Potomac protectionists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For all of the growth in intra-Asian <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in recent years, the U.S. remains Asia's single largest market, accounting on average for 30% of the exports of Asian countries. By the same token, Asia as a region far surpasses both Europe and Latin America as a destination for American exports. Without relative openness in this two-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> there is no global trading system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, if the collapse of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will have damaging political ramifications in Mexico, these are small dangers compared with the political tensions that could well ensue from Japan to China to Southeast Asia from a contraction in world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and thus economic growth. What goes under the guise of domestic protectionism in Washington would be seen across Asia as American economic imperialism. Resentment of the U.S. already is growing from China to Malaysia over American moralizing on such issues as clean air and human rights. To the extent these tensions already exist in what remains an expanding world trading system, how much more divisive will they become in a context of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> contraction?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this will play out in Congress over the next few months, where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> must compete for attention with the president's health care plan and the vice president's proposals to streamline government. While Mr. Clinton says he supports <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, he continues to postpone a major speech on its behalf or demonstrate his determination to fight and win. Indeed, some of his advisers urge him to husband scarce political capital for health care, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Asia, of course, wouldn't be the only losers if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> does fail. Mr. Clinton, American business and, of course, American consumers all would lose too. Mr. Clinton's already limited international credibility and influence would be further eroded at the very moment they are needed to force a finish to long-deadlocked talks on a new global trading agreement by December, the congressional deadline for submission of a treaty. Without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or a new General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, prospects of a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war are truly menacing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If most Asians don't yet see this larger threat, it's even more ironic that Mr. Clinton and his economic policy makers seem oblivious too. The additional irony here is that an administration that is overly eager to embrace interdependence and multilateralism for political and military purposes seems unable to grasp the far greater degree of genuine interdependence in the global economy. It's truly bizarre that the U.S. is willing to send troops to Somalia and to threaten to send them to Bosnia in the name of international cooperation while seeming to believe that a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> failure can be confined to one corner of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the simplest calculation of self-interest ought to make Congress and the White House see the global stakes. In recent years, nearly 50% of U.S. economic growth has resulted from increases in America's exports. So, if other economies don't grow and absorb U.S. exports, America grows more slowly. Yet all too many Americans have bought the protectionist rhetoric of Ross Perot that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> means forfeiting American jobs and the larger, underlying fallacy that the global economy is a finite pie where growth in one country must come at the expense of another.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How deeply this fallacy has taken root not just in Washington but across America is indicated by an anecdotal survey cited by Robert Hormats, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs International, who speaks often to American audiences. These Americans, asked whether they would prefer to see a) the U.S. economy grow at 5% a year and Japan at 10% or b) each nation grow at 2%, repeatedly opted to see the U.S. paired with Japan at low growth rather than to enjoy stronger economic growth in the U.S. even if Japan grew faster. What this adds up to is national competitiveness being subverted and perverted by mercantilist myopia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This beggar-thy-neighbor attitude springs from a larger pool of pessimism -- a downbeat dogma that, over the past decade, has been sold to Americans like snake oil by politicians, economists and sundry academic evangelists. From oil crisis to debt crisis, from budget gaps to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gaps, from \"America is overextended\" to \"America can't compete,\" it's been a ceaseless sermon of gloom-and-doom, decline-and-fall. Meantime, during the 1980s America grew nearly 20 million new jobs, American productivity gains outpaced those of all major competitors, U.S. industry reasserted its global competitiveness, such economic rivals as Japan and Germany faltered, and political enemies disappeared in the debris of the Cold War. The potion of pessimism truly was snake oil.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The paradox is that this dogma of pessimism the intellectual elite has peddled for so long may turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fact that all these other so-called crises didn't damage America's competitiveness or damp world growth doesn't mean that protectionism can't or won't.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America, a nation that demonstrably thrives on rapid change, has been led to fear precisely those circumstances of change, including free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, that play to its advantage. Similarly, a new Clinton administration that campaigned on the theme of change is feeding national economic insecurities. In the words of Labor Secretary Robert Reich, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a \"symbol of change\" and this is exactly what so jeopardizes its ratification. It will be the final irony if a painfully restructured American economy and newly resurgent American industry now lose the opportunity to compete in open global markets due to a rising tide of protectionism born of exaggerated and unwarranted pessimism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. House is vice president, international, of Dow Jones.</p>\n"}

At the same time, he also announced his support for fast track authority that would limit Congress's role in determining the content of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's call follows on legislation introduced earlier this month to grant him fast-track authority as a way of forcing Congress to speed up its consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation pact with Latin American and Asian nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Obama's desire for fast-track authority on the T.P.P. and other agreements clashes with another priority in his speech: reducing income inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This month is the 20th anniversary of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which significantly eliminated tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers across the continent and has been used as a model for the T.P.P. Anyone looking for evidence on what this new agreement will do to income inequality in America needs to consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s 20-year record.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While many analysts focus on the number of jobs lost from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and similar pacts -- and some estimates say upward of a million -- the most significant effect has been a fundamental change in the composition of jobs available to the 63 percent of American workers without a college degree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s core -- and proposed for the T.P.P. -- are investor rights and privileges that eliminate many of the risks that make firms think twice about moving production to low-wage countries. Today, goods once made here are being produced in Mexico and exported here for sale. Indeed, American manufacturing exports to Mexico and Canada grew at less than half the rate after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> than in the years before it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit has ballooned. In 1993, before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the United States had a $2.5 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico and a $29 billion deficit with Canada. In 2012, the combined <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was $181 billion, even as the share of that deficit made up of oil imports dropped 22 percent. The average annual growth of our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit has been 45 percent higher with Mexico and Canada than with countries that are not party to a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-style pact. The companies that took the most advantage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- big manufacturers like G.E., Caterpillar and Chrysler -- promised they would create more jobs at their American factories if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed. Instead, they fired American workers and shifted production to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Labor Department's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Adjustment Assistance program, which documents this trend, reads like a funeral program for the middle class. More than 845,000 workers have been certified under this one narrow and hard-to-qualify-for program as having lost their jobs because of offshoring of factories to, and growing imports from, Mexico and Canada since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The result is downward pressure on middle-class wages as manufacturing workers are forced to compete with imports made by poorly paid workers abroad. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly two out of every three displaced manufacturing workers who were rehired in 2012 saw wage reductions, most losing more than 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift in employment from high-paying manufacturing jobs to low-paying service jobs has contributed to overall wage stagnation. The average American wage has grown less than 1 percent annually in real terms since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, even as productivity grew three times faster.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decline in the wages of workers who lost a job to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is only part of the story. They joined the glut of workers competing for low-skill jobs that cannot be done offshore in industries like hospitality and food service, forcing down real wages in these sectors as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, for America's remaining manufacturing workers, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> put downward pressure on wages by enabling employers to threaten to move jobs offshore during wage bargaining. A 1997 Cornell University study ordered by the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Commission for Labor Cooperation found that as many as 62 percent of union drives faced employer threats to relocate abroad, and the factory shutdown rate following successful union certifications tripled after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is hardly news; in the early 1990s a spate of studies resulted in an academic consensus that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows contributed to between 10 and 40 percent of inequality increases. Indeed, since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s implementation, the share of national income collected by the richest 10 percent has risen by 24 percent, while the top 1 percent's share has shot up by 58 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some advocates of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-style pacts acknowledge that they will cause the loss of some jobs, but argue that workers will win over all by being able to purchase cheaper imported goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when the Center for Economic and Policy Research applied the data to the theory, they found that reductions in consumer prices had not been sufficient to offset losses in wage levels. They found that American workers without college degrees had most likely lost more than 12 percent of their wages to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-style <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, even accounting for the benefits of cheaper goods. This means a loss of more than $3,300 per year for a worker earning the median annual wage of $27,500.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> data poses a significant challenge for President Obama. As he said on Tuesday, he wants to battle the plague of income inequality and he wants to expand the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> model with T.P.P. But he cannot have it both ways.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DAVID E. BONIOR   David E.

You must be willing to fight for it. And the entity to fight for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is the U.S. Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Congress -- whose members are shouting \"fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" and \"level the playing field\" -- is the very group tilting the playing field when it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By piling items onto the cost of doing business here, Congress has helped end the positive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance that the United States ran right up until the early 1980s. Over the past 40 years, the minimum wage went up, the Environmental Protection Agency was established, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was set up. Lawmakers added the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Employment Retirement Income Security Act.  Then came the sharp increase in payroll taxes for Social Security in 1983, measures requiring plant closing notice and parental leave,  and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Health costs increased, too, making it $500 a car cheaper in health costs alone for General Motors to make Pontiacs in Canada. All this helped give us a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit that hit a record $43.1 billion in January alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if wages were equalized, it would still pay for U.S. companies to move operations to places such as China, which requires none of these aspects of America's high standard of living. Recently, columnist George Will wrote: \"The export of jobs frees U.S. workers for tasks where America has a comparative advantage.\" But in global competition, what matters is not the comparative advantage of our ability so much as the comparative disadvantage of our living standard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To really level the playing field in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> would require lowering our living standard, which is not going to happen. We value our clean air and water, our safe factories and machinery, and our rights and benefits. Both Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly support this living standard and many are prepared to raise it. The only course possible, then, is to protect the standard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To talk in these terms raises cries of \"protectionism.\" But the business of government is protection. The oath of the public servant is \"to preserve, protect and defend.\" We have the Army to protect us from enemies without and the FBI to protect us from enemies within. We have Medicare and Medicaid to protect us from ill health, and Social Security to protect us from poverty in old age. We have the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect us from stock fraud; banking laws to protect us from usurpers; truth in lending laws to protect us from charlatans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, however, multinational corporations contend that we do not need to protect, but to educate and to improve skills; productivity is the problem, they say. But the United States is the most productive industrial nation in the world, with skills galore. BMW is producing better-quality cars in South Carolina than in Munich. There are other obstacles that need addressing. For 50 years we have tried to penetrate the Japanese market, but have barely done so. To sell textiles in Korea, U.S. firms must first obtain permission from the private Korean textile industry. If you want to sell in China, it's a lot easier if you produce in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"But we will start a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war,\" is the cry. Wake up! We have been in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war for more than 200 years. And it's the United States that started it! Just after the colonies won their freedom, the mother country suggested that the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> what we produced best and, in exchange, Britain would <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> back with what it produced best -- as economist David Ricardo later described in his theory of \"comparative advantage.\" Alexander Hamilton, in his famous \"Report on Manufactures,\" told the Brits, in so many words, to bug off. He said, we are not going to remain your colony shipping you our natural resources -- rice, cotton, indigo, timber, iron ore - - and importing your manufactured products. We are going to build our own manufacturing capacity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second bill ever adopted by Congress, on July 4, 1789, was a 50 percent tariff on numerous articles. This policy of protectionism, endorsed by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, continued under President Lincoln when he launched America's steel industry by refusing to import from England the steel for the Transcontinental Railroad. President Franklin Roosevelt protected agriculture, President Eisenhower protected oil and President Kennedy protected textiles. This economic and industrial giant, the United States, was built on protectionism and, for more than a century, financed it with tariffs. And it worked.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Washington mantra of \"retrain, retrain\" comes up short. For example, Oneita Industries closed its T-shirt plant in Andrews, S.C., back in 1999. The plant had 487 employees averaging 47 years of age.  Let's assume they were \"retrained\" and became 487 skilled computer operators. Who is going to hire a 47-year-old operator over a 21-year-old operator? No one is going to take on the retirement and health costs of the 47-year-old. Moreover, that computer job probably just left for Bangalore, India.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In global competition there is a clash between standards of living. I supported free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada because we have relatively the same standard of living. But I opposed free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico, and therefore voted against the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), preferring to raise the standards in Mexico, as Europe did with Portugal, Spain and Greece before admitting them to Europe's common market. To be eligible for a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement you should first have a free market, labor rights, ownership of property, contract rights, rights of appeal and a respected judiciary. Mexico lacked these, and after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> there was an immediate flow of jobs out of the United States because of Mexico's lesser standards. Australia, on the other hand, has labor rights, environmental rights and an open market, so the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement reached with Australia this month should be approved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must engage in competitive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. To eliminate a barrier, raise a barrier. Then eliminate them both.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our trouble is that we have treated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as aid. After World War II, we were the only country with industry, and in order to prosper we needed to spread prosperity. Through the Marshall Plan, we sent money, equipment and expertise to Europe and the Pacific Rim. And it worked. Capitalism defeated communism in the Cold War. Our hope in crying \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" was that markets would remain open for our exports. But our cries went unheeded, and now our nation's security is in jeopardy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>National security is like a three-legged stool. The first leg -- values -- is solid. Our stand for freedom and democracy is respected around the world. The second leg of military strength is unquestioned. But the third leg, the economic leg, is fractured and needs repair. We are losing jobs faster than we can create them. Some time ago the late Akio Morita, founder of Sony Corp., was lecturing leaders of third-world countries, admonishing them to develop their manufacturing capacity to become nation states. Then, pointing at me in the audience, he stated, \"That world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should we do? First, we need to stop financing the elimination of jobs. Tax benefits for offshore production must end. Royalty deductions allowed for offshore activities must be eliminated, and tax havens for corporations must be closed down.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next, we need an assistant attorney general to enforce our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws and agreements. At present, enforcement is largely left to an injured party. It can take years to jump over legal hurdles. Then at the end, based on national security, the president can refuse to implement a court order. Rather than waste time and money, corporate America has moved offshore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We need to organize government to produce and protect jobs, rather than export them. The Commerce Department recently co- sponsored a New York seminar, part of which advised companies on how to move jobs offshore. This aid for exporting jobs must stop. The Department of Commerce should be reconstituted as a Department of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Commerce, with the secretary as czar over the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative. The department's International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Administration should determine not only whether goods have been dumped on the U.S. market, but how big the \"injury\" is to U.S. industry. The International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission should be eliminated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While it is illegal to sell foreign-made goods below cost in the U.S. market (a practice called dumping), we refuse to enforce such violations. The Treasury Department reports $2 billion worth of illegal transshipments of textiles into the United States each year. Customs agents charged with drug enforcement and homeland security are hard-pressed to stop these transshipments. We need at least 1,000 additional Customs agents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It won't be easy. A culture of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has developed. The big banks that make most of their money outside the country, as well as the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation (whose members make bigger profits on imported articles) and the editorial writers of newspapers that make most of their profits from retail ads -- all these descend on Washington promoting \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" to members of Congress. Members looking for contributions shout the loudest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not just jobs, but also the middle class and the strength of our very democracy are in jeopardy.  As Lincoln said, \"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. . . . As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today's dogma is the belief that protectionism will mean <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war and economic stagnation. But we are already in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war, one from which the president and the Congress are AWOL.Ernest Hollings is the senior U.S. senator from South Carolina.

If this is a negotiating tactic of making extreme demands only to settle for much less and claim victory, maybe it will work. Otherwise Mr. Trump is playing a game of chicken he can't win.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's obsession with undoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> threatens the economy he has so far managed rather well. The roaring stock market, rising GDP and tight job market are signs that deregulation and the promise of tax reform are restoring business and consumer confidence. Blowing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would blow up all that too. It could be the worst economic mistake by a U.S. President since Richard Nixon trashed Bretton-Woods and imposed wage and price controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. demands in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiations--which returned to Washington last week--are growing more bizarre. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer now wants to add a sunset clause, which would automatically kill it in five years unless all three governments agree to keep it. In other words, the U.S. proposes to increase economic uncertainty and raise the incentive for businesses to deploy capital to more reliable investment climates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. also wants to change <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s \"rules of origin\" for autos. Cars now made in North America can cross all three borders duty-free if 62.5% of their content is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-made. Mr. Lighthizer wants to raise that to 85% and add a subclause requiring 50% be made in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer needs to get out more. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s current rules-of-origin for autos are already the highest of any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement in the world, says John Murphy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Raising them would give car makers an incentive to source components from Asia and pay America's low 2.5% most-favored-nation tariff. A higher-content rule would hurt Mexico, but it won't bring jobs to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adding a domestic content requirement also would violate World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization rules, so neither Mexico nor Canada are likely to agree. And if they did, it would harm U.S. workers. Auto companies that now make cars for export in the U.S., using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-made components, would simply move abroad more of their manufacturing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to overstate the damage that ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would inflict on the U.S. auto industry. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, companies tap the comparative advantages of all three markets and have created an intricate web of supply chains to maximize returns. As Charles Uthus at the American Automotive Policy Council said last week, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"brings scale, it brings competitiveness, it brings efficiencies [and] synergies between all three countries, and it brings duty-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" Its demise would be \"basically a $10 billion tax on the auto industry in America.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week the Boston Consulting Group also released a study</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>sponsored by the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association that found ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could mean the loss of 50,000 American jobs in the auto-parts industry as Mexico and Canada revert to pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has elections next year and no party that bows to unreasonable demands by Mr. Trump can win.

Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus has vanished. A $17 billion deficit is expected in 1995. Translation: 340,000 lost American jobs. Our winter tomato industry is in ruins. Illegal immigration is rising. Mexico has become the port of entry for America's cocaine.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And, oh yes, Mr. Salinas was asked to leave the country, and is now under investigation for the cover-up of an assassination, while Mr. Clinton and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Republicans put us on the hook for $50 billion in loans to Mexico City.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Newly installed President Ernesto Zedillo said he needed the cash to pay off bonds held by Citibank and Goldman Sachs, lest the New World Order come crashing down around the ears of its panicked acolytes. We shall never see the money again; our grandchildren will pay it off.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Comes now a report from the International Monetary Fund that we were had. The Mexican crisis was overblown. Mexicans themselves had panicked and pulled down the peso. The world financial system was never in danger.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As with Vietnam, where the Best and Brightest who marched us in went on to new careers while the families of the 58,000 dead grieved, so it is with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. For America's elite there is never accountability.  That is for the rest of us.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there are winners in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement scam. American companies are closing factories here, and from Monterrey to Mexico City, a new Detroit is rising. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> made Mexico an \"enterprise zone\" of 90 million people where the minimum wage is 58 cents an hour, American health and safety standards do not exist, and men will fight one another to live in shacks outside a plant gate to work 10 hours a day for a fraction of the wage Americans get.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1924, the party of Coolidge defended a 40 percent tariff by declaring as its purpose: \"To support the high American economic level of life for the average family and to prevent a lowering to the level of economic life prevailing in other lands.\" From Lincoln on, that was party dogma.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of another tariff, Daniel Webster wrote, \"I am looking not for a law such as will benefit capitalists -- they can take care of themselves -- but for a law that shall induce capitalists to invest their capital in such a manner as to occupy and employ American labor.\" We, too, seek such laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between the declining real wages of American workers, down 20 percent in 20 years, and treaties like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the correlation is absolute. Yet those who call for restoring a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy that puts America first are answered with the epithets of our elites: \"Isolationists!\" \"Protectionists!\" \"Nativists!\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toward Mexico's hard-working people, robbed repeatedly by their own governments, we offer friendship. Toward the one-party kleptocracy that has misruled Mexico for 60 years, whose proudest boast is that in 1938 it stole American oil wells, our policy should be cool correctness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should be canceled.

{"id": "2098605775.xml", "text": "<h2>A Bogus Deal on Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is a nearly 25-year-old agreement that needs to be modernized to address new technologies, update intellectual property rights and protect American industry and workers from unfair competition. Instead, President Trump has proposed replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with something worse, a vague agreement that could hurt American workers and raise prices for American consumers while antagonizing America's neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Trumpian worldview, Canada isn't a friendly neighbor but a frosty enemy bent on ruining our steel, auto and dairy industries while cutting down forests in British Columbia and trucking the lumber across the border. Fiends! Likewise, as he sees it, Mexico ships tequila, produce and people north, and imports our higher-paying manufacturing jobs. Desperados! Yet his solutions would simply add complications with few benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the revised, don't-call-it-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bilateral deal with Mexico that he awkwardly announced last week, 75 percent of the value of vehicles exported to the United States would have to come from North American-made parts, up from the current 62.5 percent. And 40-to-45 percent of the value would have to be made by workers who earn at least $16 an hour, even though no Mexican autoworkers earn $16 an hour, and none will. Otherwise, Mexican-assembled vehicles would be subject to a 2.5 percent tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The logic here is that auto-related jobs would supposedly flood back to the United States as labor costs rise in Mexico. That logic is dubious. Automakers in Mexico would rather pay the 2.5 percent tariff, figuring it would not raise prices enough to hurt sales seriously. If it did, they could stop making those cars for the American market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump has particular animus for the dairy industry in Canada. There's no question that protectionist constraints keep milk prices there high and farmers profitable. The Canadians have pointed to subsidies that American farmers get and are resisting Mr. Trump's no-compromise demand to throw their cows under the bus. Mr. Trump also wants Canada to join Mexico in agreeing to drop Chapter 19 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a dispute resolution protocol. Canada has used it to fight off tariffs on its softwood and paper products. Mr. Trump's softwood and paper tariffs are hurting Canadian industry, but also are raising lumber prices in the United States so much that the housing market has slowed. Isn't that a great deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American farmers have been big losers in this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war and would remain so under this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. After Mr. Trump assessed tariffs on Mexican metals, Mexico imposed tariffs on corn and pork. The bilateral agreement restores the status quo on agriculture, but Mexico has, in the meantime, cultivated other sources of supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Auto companies have developed global supply chains since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> began in 1994, costing thousands of manufacturing jobs in the United States, as low-value work shifted to Mexico and other lower-cost countries. Auto companies have also built plants here using the same supply chain rationale, though, partly because labor costs in those American plants have decreased in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Mexico, in turn, is becoming less dependent on the American market every year -- meaning the deal is covering fewer and fewer jobs. So Mr. Trump's deal isn't going to be getting jobs back from Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on cars if Canada doesn't submit to his demands will be painful -- to Canada, and to General Motors, which produces the Chevrolet Impala and other models there. He's also threatened the European Union, which has offered to remove tariffs on autos if the United States does the same. That's not good enough for Mr. Trump, who thinks Europeans should be forced to buy American-made cars. Should the president carry out threats to hit imports, the United States stands to lose 200,000 jobs, according to Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, because cars assembled in the United States contain imported parts, including engines. Prices would rise; sales would fall. Auto sales are cooling globally, so creating obstacles for the industry is foolish policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having failed to browbeat Canada into submission by the American-imposed Aug. 31 deadline, the administration told Congress it will go ahead with the Mexico deal. Canada is free to join under those terms, within 30 days. No thank you, said the ever diplomatic Canadian minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland. \"Once we have a good deal for Canada,\" Ms. Freeland said, \"we have a deal.\" The ever-petulant Mr. Trump then tweet-threatened not only Canada but his own Congress: \"If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> entirely & we will be far better off...\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We will certainly not be better off. Nor is Congress planning to cede its authority in treaty making. The president can and should expect a bipartisan pushback against an unnecessary and abusive bad \"deal.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Canada has oil, electricity, water, all the things that the United States desperately needs,\" notes Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor Canada, a leading <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> union. \"So for him to pick a fight with us makes no sense, either philosophically or economically.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correct, Mr. Dias.

Not merely renegotiated: rebranded! What was once the easily pronounceable \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" will hereafter be the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or \"USMCA.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the name change was needed is a little unclear. Our marketer in chief clearly loves rebranding things, and USMCA, while it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does have the virtue of literally putting America first. Oddly, the posted text of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact itself still repeatedly refers to itself as \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2018.\" I guess someone forgot to search-and-replace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to the substance, well, the best you can say is it could have been a whole lot worse. President Trump didn't, as he threatened, blow up the system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, you know, whoop de doo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some new protectionist measures, such as complicated new requirements for auto rules of origin, which could potentially backfire. That is, they may end up being so costly to adhere to that they'll encourage manufacturers to move more of their operations and jobs outside of North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other stuff, such as a \"sunset\" provision requiring members to regularly reaffirm their desire to continue the three-party deal, is probably also not an improvement. There are better ways to encourage ongoing modernization of the deal that would involve less policy uncertainty for businesses. But, again, this section is not as bad as many businesses and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also won some modest concessions in tiny industries he's weirdly obsessed with, such as Canadian dairy. He has conveniently played down the concessions he made in exchange: In return for greater American access to the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg markets, we gave Canada greater access to U.S. markets for dairy, peanuts, processed peanut products, sugar and sugar-containing products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the most part, despite Trump's assertion that \"it's not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> redone, it's a brand-new deal,\" the president mostly kept <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> intact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, some of the more significant changes \u2014 relating to issues such as labor standards, environmental protections and e-commerce \u2014 appear to be cribbed from another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that Trump has demonized: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you (like me) supported TPP, this is either reassuring or supremely frustrating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Barack Obama negotiated TPP \u2014 a 12-party pact that included Canada and Mexico \u2014 as part of his own promise to \"renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" TPP was also Obama's strategy for keeping China from writing \"the rules of the road\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. China was deliberately excluded from the pact, which was designed to cement a coalition of countries that had been wounded by China's misbehavior. Working together, these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> victims hoped to pressure China to reform.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's first orders of business as president, of course, was to pull out of TPP. He soon thereafter picked unnecessary <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fights with TPP countries we'd previously tried to make common cause with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Trump seems to have realized his mistake. Despite how he characterizes his \"historic transaction,\" the USMCA is mostly just a smooshing together of two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that he derided as the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals ever made, as Dartmouth Tuck School of Business professor Emily Blanchard points out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, a bunch of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 language appears squarely aimed at returning to Obama's alliance strategy for isolating China \u2014 which, to reiterate, only requires rebuilding because Trump destroyed it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-replacement deal includes \"protections against misappropriation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets, including by state-owned enterprises,\" one of China's major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sins. Likewise, there's also language designed to disincentivize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 signatories from making free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with \"non-market\" countries, widely understood to be targeting China. Some have speculated that Trump may press for similar language in negotiations with other countries, such as Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, Trump has wrought a lot of destruction in service of landing us in roughly the same position we would have been in had we simply stayed in TPP and pursued more amicable negotiations with Mexico and Canada on other outstanding issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of these harms \u2014 such as the steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures that, despite Sunday's announcement, remain on the books \u2014 may yet be reversible. But the damage to our reputation as a reliable trading partner and ally may be irreparable. To Trump, that may be a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n"}

He may also put in a plug for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement his administration is negotiating with 11 PacificRim nations and for fast-track legislation that would limit congressional input in the accord to facilitate its ratification.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If he does both -- bemoan rising inequality and promote yet another free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement -- his speech will rate a chapter in the annals of self-negation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, even the most ossified right-wing economists concede that globalization has played a major role in the loss of American manufacturing jobs and, more broadly, the stagnation of U.S. wages and incomes. Former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder has calculatedthat 22 percent to 29 percent of all U.S. jobs could potentially be offshored. That's a lot of jobs: 25 percent would translate to 36 millionworkers whose wages are in competition with those in largely lower-income nations. Of the 11 nations with which the United States is negotiating the TPP, nine have wage levels significantly lower than ours.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements that promote the relocation of U.S. corporations' factories to nations like China and Mexico have played a central role in the evisceration of American manufacturing and the decline in U.S. workers' incomes. Two out of three displaced manufacturing workers who got new jobs between 2009 and 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports,experienced wage reductions -- most of them greater than 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the most devastating argument against the kind of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords the United States has entered into over the past quarter-century has been that inadvertently made by those defenders of such agreements who have used the 20th anniversary of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- it went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994 -- to celebrate its achievements. I've read many commemorative editorials, columns and speeches in praise of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and not one of them has so much as mentioned the agreement's effect on U.S. employment, wages or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. In October, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who was one of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s architects in the administration of George H.W. Bush, delivered a lengthy, glowing assessment of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s achievements that managed to avoid any of those topics. The champion of avoidance seems to be Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. At a San Diego conference in October, a public radio reporter asked her, \"And where has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> not lived up to some of the hopes and promises?\" Pritzker replied: \"I don't think about where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't lived up.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one statistic in the deal's defense that Pritzker cited in that interview is that the total volume of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> signatories now exceeds $1 trillion a year. What she failed to note, however, is that the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico has risen from $27 billion in 1993, the last pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> year, to $181 billion in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By avoiding discussion of the consequences that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with developing nations have on U.S. workers, not to mention our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance, defenders of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are indulging in the worst kind of imperviousness to facts. But when the case for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is coupled with the case for raising U.S. workers' incomes, it enters a zone where real numbers, and real Americans' lives, matter. In that zone, the argument for the kind of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal embodied by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, permanent normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership completely blows up.

{"id": "2375437368.xml", "text": "<h2>Bernie Sanders Versus the World</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bernie Sanders sat in a mostly empty room at a Detroit convention center four days before the Michigan primary on Tuesday, and he spoke softly about failure. \u201cIn the 1950s,\u201d he said, \u201cthis was a wealthy, prosperous community. And then \u2026.\u201d His eight guests, people whose lives have been touched by shifts in American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, nodded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a broad treaty signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993 that reduced tariffs and duties between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Mr. Sanders voted against it in the House \u2014 and against its recent replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as a senator.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI have done my best to oppose these disastrous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements,\u201d Mr. Sanders said later at a public round table with his guests \u2014 labor leaders, autoworkers, activists. \u201cJoe Biden has supported them.\u201d To this day, he added, Mr. Biden doesn\u2019t consider his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vote a mistake.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this messaging is new, but it is tailored to the Midwest, with its historically robust labor movement. It\u2019s also slightly more negative than Mr. Sanders seems entirely comfortable with: He has never liked attacking his opponents specifically, but with the race for the nomination rapidly advancing, he sees little choice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, he maintains his penchant for addressing broad, overarching themes. Mr. Sanders speaks of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as synecdoche for the ills of capitalism: the exploitation of workers, the \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d Likewise, he speaks of Mr. Biden as synecdoche for the Democratic establishment, which united on the eve of Super Tuesday to halt Mr. Sanders\u2019s rise. Even now, the consolidation against Mr. Sanders continues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, endorsed Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders on Thursday. This despite the fact that Mr. Sanders stumped for her in 2018, delivering a fiery address in Ann Arbor laced with the very ideas Ms. Whitmer now considers divisive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cIn the Biden campaign,\u201d Ms. Whitmer told me at a Detroit restaurant on Friday, \u201cthere is space for everyone.\u201d Mr. Biden, she said, is skilled at forming such broad coalitions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But ordinary voters \u2014 or at least the ones I spoke to at Mr. Sanders\u2019s rally at Detroit\u2019s TCF Center on Friday night \u2014 seem undisturbed by Mr. Sanders\u2019s brashness, or at least oblivious to it. With them, his message is what resonates the loudest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jevon J. Johnson, a Detroit police captain who has been on the force for 21 years, happened to be stationed at the rally, working security. After Mr. Sanders shook his hand \u2014 the senator routinely goes out of his way to greet workers at the facilities his campaign uses \u2014 Captain Johnson told me he supports Mr. Sanders because \u201che\u2019s got a good agenda,\u201d including \u201creduced prices for education. I just think everybody should have an opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shannon Schenk-Torres, a 48-year-old banquet supervisor at the TCF Center, also supports Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders\u2019s platform seems the most robust to her, and the most extreme: \u201cI am left, but now I\u2019m twice as left as before\u201d 2016, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take someone twice as left to cancel out all the bad stuff that\u2019s happened over the last four years.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some 6,000 people, many hoisting aloft \u201cBernie\u201d signs, packed into the convention center\u2019s auditorium. Most were young, and many appeared to be teenagers, arriving in groups of friends.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They roared for Mr. Sanders, who used his time not only to make his usual case \u2014 that money in politics has been a scourge on American policymaking and that many mainstream Democrats have an interest in maintaining the status quo \u2014 but also to bring it to bear on Mr. Biden\u2019s record. Rallygoers booed when Mr. Sanders brought up Mr. Biden\u2019s support of the Iraq war, the bank bailouts of 2008, the credit card industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The theme was, \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d The crowd seemed to intuit that it really is that simple \u2014 it\u2019s either the way things have been or the way they could be.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s primary, Mr. Biden has been scarce in Michigan, sending surrogates to stump and scheduling only two in-person events the day before the vote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sanders, by contrast, spent the weekend in Michigan, hosting events in Detroit, Dearborn, Ann Arbor and Flint. As Mr. Biden has pulled ahead in Michigan polls, Mr. Sanders has poured money into building a ground game in the state, with several field offices, paid organizers and grass-roots canvassing efforts. After a bruising Super Tuesday in which he claimed only four states to Mr. Biden\u2019s 10, Mr. Sanders came to Michigan to fight for the same voters who delivered his narrow victory over Hillary Clinton in the state four years ago, in hopes of beating the establishment candidate once again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the Sanders field office in Hamtramck, an immigrant-heavy enclave in Detroit, I found volunteers preparing to go knocking on doors. As a field organizer addressed the crowd \u2014 a mix of young and old, male and female, black, brown, and white \u2014 a printer balanced on a folding table in the back of the room turned out stacks of fliers in Arabic, English and Bengali.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the pep talk concluded, I rode with Sarah Peslar, 47, to a street in Hamtramck where she would begin her day\u2019s work. She has been a social worker for some 20 years, she told me, and currently works at a free health clinic for children in Hamtramck. \u201cMy biggest issue is health care and the cost of health care,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Peslar ascended a series of porch stairs, knocked, waited. Sometimes doors opened \u2014 cautiously, at first, behind screen doors or bars \u2014 and sometimes the occupants fetched their children to translate. Bernie wants to help, Ms. Peslar said; he wants to give you health care and your kids an education. Nearly everyone accepted the literature; several confirmed they would vote for Mr. Sanders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2017 American Community Survey, 52 percent of the people living on the street we visited were in poverty, with a per-capita annual income of $10,715 each. Nearly 48 percent received food stamps. They are desperately poor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They need something, anything. It can all seem so hopeless, this Sanders-against-the-world effort: not just <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements but capitalism, not just Joe Biden but the entire Democratic establishment, not just Donald Trump but the oligarchy that created him. But there\u2019s nothing else to do but fight, and the people who live closest to the pain Mr. Sanders aims to alleviate seem to know it. That much, at least, has gotten through.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it comes directly from the top of the campaign. With the odds and scope of his mission being what they are, I asked Mr. Sanders, on the cold night of his Detroit rally, what kept him fighting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sanders sighed, as though the question has occurred to him, too. He does not look contemplative or melancholy when he meditates on these things, but rather furious. He brought up his supporters, the poor and struggling who send him slivers of their slim paychecks in raw, desperate hope. \u201cIt\u2019s not my style to give up,\u201d he said, finally, reflecting on his own nature. \u201cI was born with a lot of endurance.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Elizabeth Bruenig (@ebruenig) is an Opinion writer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "433379085.xml", "text": "<h2>How to Be a Good Neighbor</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Greg Grandin, a professor of history at New York University, is the author of ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States and the Rise of the New Imperialism.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Aztecs used to believe that history is not linear but circular, with great events repeating themselves on a regular basis. That certainly seems to be the case with Mexico, which has a revolution once every hundred years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1810, peasants thrown off their land by plantation owners led a violent five-year rebellion that paved the way for Mexico's independence from Spain. In 1910, an instance of electoral fraud ignited an agrarian revolution, which in turn kicked off a decade-long civil war in which millions of Mexicans died.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearly a century later, Mexico's current electoral crisis likewise is propelled by rural unrest -- this time largely brought about by the anger of agricultural workers displaced by the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the center-left presidential candidate who is contesting the declared victory of Felipe Calderon in last Sunday's election, draws much of his support from this increasingly restive population of rural poor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico was self-sufficient in corn and bean production. Today, one out of three Mexican tortillas is made with cheap corn meal from the United States. In 1993, more than 10 million Mexicans made their living off the land. Today, even as Mexico's population has grown, that number has plummeted to about seven million.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican farmers simply can't compete with capital-intensive United States agribusiness, which continues to enjoy generous government subsidies. Moreover, Mexican commodity importers receive low-interest loans to buy crops from the United States. Every year, nearly three million tons of harvested Mexican corn is left to rot because it is too expensive to sell.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexicans have reason to worry that this is not all the trouble <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has in store. In 2008, the agreement's final provision is set to go into effect, eliminating the last tariffs on United States corn and beans and ending the subsidies Mexico gives to its peasant farmers -- all the while leaving untouched the far larger subsidies Washington doles out to its own agricultural sector. During his campaign, Mr. Lopez Obrador pledged to renegotiate this provision, but J. B. Penn, the United States undersecretary of agriculture, last month pre-emptively responded by saying that ''we have no interest in renegotiating any parts of the agreement.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the last decade and a half, Washington and its allies in Mexican politics, including Mr. Calderon, have promoted a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> economic model that has failed to deliver the prosperity its advocates promised. Although the Mexican economy grew by 3 percent last year, the country's poverty and inequality indicators remain typical to bad by Latin American standards, with the richest 10 percent of citizens controlling 43 percent of the country's wealth, while some 40 percent of Mexicans live below the poverty line.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These problems, combined with Mexican anger over the immigration debate in the United States, run the risk of souring relations between our two countries for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is a way the Bush administration can help to set things on a different course. Although election officials say Mr. Calderon won the presidential vote, the United States should not rush to embrace him as the election's victor. The official tally gives Mr. Calderon a razor-thin lead, and there are credible reports of significant irregularities that could, at best, weaken the legitimacy of a Calderon presidency, and at worst, lead to escalating protests. The disputed votes include the 904,000 annulled ballots that come primarily from regions that went heavily for Mr. Lopez Obrador, as well as discrepancies between the numbers handed in by polling stations and the actual ballots cast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best thing the United States can do now is to support the push for a recount and to refrain from calling on Mr. Lopez Obrador to concede. Then, no matter who finally wins the election, the White House should renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, allowing Mexico to set its own policy in support of its rural economy. If the Bush administration does otherwise, it might help begin yet another season of Mexican upheaval -- just as the Aztecs might have predicted.</p>\n"}
{"id": "293439242.xml", "text": "<h2>Big Greens' Double-Dealing Dooms Dolphins; The administration enlists key environmental groups to deep-six the tuna safety law.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A bizarre alliance stretching from Vice President Al Gore through major U.S. green groups to narco-traffickers in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia is now pushing the vile \"dolphin death bill\" that threatens to clear the House as early as next week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the great triumphs of grass-roots environmentalism in this country was the battle in the late 1980s to ban the sale of \"dolphin unsafe\" tuna, meaning fish caught by nets that also ensnared dolphins. Tuna fishing's toll on the dolphins of the eastern Pacific was dreadful, killing at least 7 million dolphin over 15 years. A turning point in the campaign was the surrender of the Heinz subsidiary Star Kist. A U.S. law banning the sale of dolphin-unsafe tuna soon followed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last summer, the Mexican government quietly let it be known that under the terms of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, it should be permitted to sell its canned tuna in U.S. markets, even though its fishing fleets had taken no measures to ensure that dolphins were not part of the regular haul.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It will be recalled that at a crucial moment in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> battle in late 1993, the Clinton administration was able to brandish a statement of support for the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement from seven major environmental organizations. Among them were the Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, World Wildlife Fund and the National Wildlife Federation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration adopted the view that the Mexican request was entirely legitimate, but that the big green groups had to be trotted out once more, to provide the necessary political camouflage. Closed-door sessions were held at the Mexican Embassy in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The House bill fronted by the greens repeals the current dolphin protection law and will permit the unlimited sale of dolphin-unsafe tuna in the U.S. There are many devious components to this legislation, but perhaps none more egregious than language that will allow the Mexican tuna to be marketed under the \"dolphin safe\" seal, even though such tuna may have been caught by the \"chasing and encircling method,\" known to kill thousands of dolphins each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The litany of double-dealing is a familiar one, starting with Ozone Man himself, Gore, who has already appeased Norwegian whaling interests last year in the name of GATT and now seems intent on using his environmental credentials to forge a similar deal for Mexico on dolphins.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore wrote last month to all members of Congress, saying that the administration \"strongly supports\" the dolphin death bill. The vice president trots out the astonishing argument that we have to kill more dolphins to protect the ocean ecosystem. To buttress this laughable proposition, he flourishes the bill's support by the five big national green groups.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sounding very much like a fully fledged free-market environmentalist, Greenpeace president Barbara Dudley says that, \"The current dolphin-safe tuna laws represent a kind of green protectionism. We need to give Third World nations economic incentives to protect the oceans.\" There is vigorous opposition to the bill from Earth Island Institute and the Ralph Nader-led Citizens <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And why would there be such vehement pressure from Mexico, Colombia and Panama? All of these countries have tuna fishing fleets and tuna hauls that under existing laws can't be imported into the U.S. But tuna is not the only commodity thus inconvenienced. Tuna fleets in Latin America have long been associated with the smuggling north of cocaine and heroin. Last year the Nataly I, a tuna boat registered in Panama but owned by the Cali cartel in Colombia, was seized in the Pacific by U.S. drug agents, who found a 12-ton cargo of cocaine on its way to Mexico, staging point for 80% of the cocaine entering the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few weeks ago, Jose Castrillon Henao, owner of many tuna boats including the Nataly I, revealed after being arrested in Panama that he has given significant contributions to the campaign chests of Panama's president and attorney general. In Colombia and Venezuela, there are similar close ties between the drug kings and the politicians rushing to Washington to call for the dismantling of U.S. dolphin-safe laws in the name of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In Venezuela, indeed, cocaine is often familiarly termed atun blanco--white tuna.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here we see the consequences of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>: bad for workers on both sides of the border, bad for dolphins and a bonanza for corrupt political elites and drug smugglers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Alexander Cockburn is the coauthor, with Ken Silverstein, of \"Washington Babylon,\" new from Verso</p>\n"}
{"id": "1863463136.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's a great neighbor, for now</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was a no-show at the White House today. Late last week he scratched his scheduled visit to Washington, D.C., resigned to the fact that President Trump is in no mood to engage with any Mexico other than the one he's created in his imagination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump spun a dystopian, fictitious narrative of Mexicans and Mexico as villainous obstacles to American greatness. It took only a few days for Trump once in office to create the deepest crisis in U.S.-Mexican relations in decades, by reaffirming his intention to build a border wall (paid for by you know who), step up deportations of workers in this country illegally, and scrap the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. If it's possible to breach diplomatic treaty obligations via Twitter, Trump has been busy doing so, browbeating and bullying U.S. companies investing in Mexico, and threatening to impose unilateral import tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States faces a number of crises and profound challenges in the world, but our relationship with Mexico, until now, has hardly been one of them. Ties with Mexico should have been listed in the incoming business-minded administration's portfolio of impressive assets to safeguard and grow, not in the liabilities column.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the two decades since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect, Mexico has become a more democratic, more middle class, more stable and more outward-looking country than it ever was before -- much more the neighbor the U.S. always wanted. The traditional anti-Americanism that colored Mexican political discourse throughout much of the 20th century (summed up by the old saying \"Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the U.S.\") has largely vanished.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Migration between both countries, contrary to what you hear on the nativist media outlets that created the receptive swamp for Trump's campaign narrative, has been an asset for the North American economy. It has provided hardworking employees to American businesses, while further financing Mexico's development in the form of cross-border remittances. Besides, emigration from Mexico peaked in 2000, and in recent years more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have arrived.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump is making much of the roughly $60-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit the U.S. runs with Mexico, but let's not lose sight of the fact that Mexico is now the second-largest purchaser of American goods, to the tune of $236 billion in 2015. And unlike U.S. imports from China, nearly 40% of the components in industrial imports from Mexico are produced in the United States. This reflects the extent to which many companies have acted on the promise of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, integrating their North American supply chains to make our region more competitive as a manufacturing platform.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under Pena Nieto, Mexico has also enacted politically sensitive reforms to its energy sector that are hugely beneficial to U.S. business and national security interests, and opened other sectors of its economy to American investment. The disdain with which all of these positive trends have been met by Trump and his supporters leaves many Mexicans feeling, as former Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda told the New York Times last week: \"Like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's unfortunate that there isn't a more outspoken pro-Mexico lobby on this side of the border to advocate for the relationship, but until now complacency has been a hallmark of American attitudes toward Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States is lucky to count Mexico and Canada as its neighbors, but as with most geographic realities, this strategic blessing is taken for granted. Ours is the only great continental power in history to have the luxury of not having to deploy the bulk of its military to protect its borders -- despite the fact that we snatched away half of Mexican territory in a 19th century war Abraham Lincoln decried as highly immoral. Instead, almost like an island-based empire, we've been able to project our forces, and our strategy-shaping elites' attention, elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration's actions, if unopposed, will serve only to destabilize Mexico and weaken the entire region, including the domestic economy. The peso has been plummeting in value against the dollar, which hurts Mexico's ability to buy American goods and will widen the deficit between both countries. Growing uncertainty about North American economic integration will redirect manufacturing investment to Asia. A Trump-triggered economic downturn in Mexico could, perversely, increase illegal immigration into this country. In the long run, worst of all, Trump's rhetorical and policy assault on such an accommodating neighbor is likely to resurrect rampant anti-American sentiment in Mexico and turn one of our stalwart allies into something entirely different -- more like the Mexico of Trump's dystopian fiction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes alternative facts can become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Andres Martinez is a professor of journalism at Arizona State University, a New America fellow, and the executive editor of Zocalo Public Square.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: MEXICAN PRESIDENT Enrique Pena Nieto canceled his trip this week to meet with President Trump, who has created the deepest crisis in U.S.-Mexican relations in decades.; PHOTOGRAPHER:Rebecca Blackwell Associated Press; PHOTO: MEXICAN PRESIDENT Enrique Pena Nieto canceled his trip this week to meet with President Trump, who has created the deepest crisis in U.S.-Mexican relations in decades.; PHOTOGRAPHER:Drew Angerer Getty Images</p>\n"}
{"id": "409986528.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA and Nativism</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everybody talks about globalization; nobody ever does anything about it. The world labor market looms over every horizon with its promise of cheaper goods and lower pay. The public is skeptical, rightly, about the benefits of globalization, but the process of harnessing it, of writing enforceable rules that would benefit not just investors but most of our citizens, is hard to even conceive. And so globalization is experienced by many Americans as a loss of control. Manufacturing moves to China, engineering to India; que sera, sera.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except on our borders. With the number of immigrants illegally in the United States estimated at  11 million, the tensions between Americans and Mexicans  --  chiefly, working-class Americans and working-class Mexicans  --  are rising. And those are tensions that congressional Republicans, who don't look to have a lot of other issues they can run on this fall, are eager to stoke.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In December the House approved a bill by Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin that would turn all those undocumented immigrants into felons. It would supersede local ordinances that keep police from inquiring into the status of people coming forth to report crimes or help in investigations. It would help create a permanent underground population in our midst, with no hope of ever attaining legal status.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the most striking aspect of the assault on undocumented immigrants is that it has no theory of causality. Over 40 percent of the Mexicans who have come, legally and illegally, to the United States have done so in the past 15 years. The boom in undocumenteds is even more concentrated than that: There were just 2.5 million such immigrants in the United States in 1995; fully 8 million have arrived since then.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why? It's not because we've let down our guard at the border; to the contrary, the border is more militarized now than it's ever been. The answer is actually simpler than that. In large part, it's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was sold, of course, as a boon to the citizens of the United States, Canada and Mexico  --  guaranteed both to raise incomes and lower prices, however improbably, throughout the continent. Bipartisan elites promised that it would stanch the flow of illegal immigrants, too. \"There will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home,\" said President Bill Clinton as he was building support for the measure in the spring of 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which took effect in 1994, could not have been more precisely crafted to increase immigration  --  chiefly because of its devastating effect on Mexican agriculture. As liberal economist Jeff Faux points out in \"The Global Class War,\" his just-published indictment of the actual workings of the new economy, Mexico had been home to a poor agrarian sector for generations, which the government helped sustain through price supports on corn and beans. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, though, put those farmers in direct competition with incomparably more efficient U.S. agribusinesses. It proved to be no contest: From 1993 through 2002, at least 2 million Mexican farmers were driven off their land.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The experience of Mexican industrial workers under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't been a whole lot better. With the passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the maquiladoras on the border boomed. But the raison d'etre for these factories was to produce exports at the lowest wages possible, and with the Mexican government determined to keep its workers from unionizing, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boom for Mexican workers never materialized. In the pre- <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> days of 1975, Faux documents, Mexican wages came to 23 percent of U.S. wages; in 1993-94, just before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, they amounted to 15 percent; and by 2002 they had sunk to a mere 12 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official Mexican poverty rate rose from 45.6 percent in 1994 to 50.3 percent in 2000. And that was before competition from China began to shutter the maquiladoras and reduce Mexican wages even more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So if Sensenbrenner wants to identify a responsible party for the immigration he so deplores, he might take a peek in the mirror. In the winter of '93, he voted for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He helped establish a system that increased investment opportunities for major corporations and diminished the rights, power and, in many instances, living standards of workers on both sides of the border. Now he and his Republican colleagues are stirring the resentments of the same American workers they placed in jeopardy by supporting the corporate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Walls on the border won't fix this problem, nor will forcing cops to arrest entire barrios. So long as the global economy is designed, as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was, to keep workers powerless, Mexican desperation and American anger will only grow. Forget the fence. We need a new rulebook for the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>meyersonh@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "421703723.xml", "text": "<h2>GLOBALIZATION; Many Latin Americans Oppose Trade Deal; Critics want a partnership, but a more equitable one.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Porto Alegre, Brazil--In U.S. living rooms, talk about such policy measures as the White House's proposed Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas (FTAA) is likely to elicit clueless shrugs. But south of the Rio Grande, millions of Latin Americans consider FTAA--and U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy in general--to be an immediate issue of life and death urgency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No surprise, then, that as some 40,000 social activists and scholars met here last week to strategize against what they call \"corporate globalization,\" they chose resistance to the FTAA as one of their top priorities. \"We will fight it every possible way and we will defeat it,\" vowed Luis Inacio da Silva, Brazil's most important opposition politician. As head of the left-of-center Workers' Party, which governs large parts of Brazil, Da Silva, or \"Lula\" as he is known to most Brazilians, is currently leading in opinion polls for this October's presidential election. The FTAA, he says, \"isn't really a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. Rather, it's a policy of annexation of Latin America by the United States.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lula's characterization of the agreement is at sharp odds with that of the Bush administration, which claims that the proposed agreement would help the hemisphere's poor by encouraging a freer flow of goods among all 34 countries stretching between Canada and Argentina. The administration hopes a pact can be approved and implemented by 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, why such a sour view from Lula and other Latin Americans-- the very people President Bush says this agreement would benefit? Critics of the FTAA say it would allow powerful countries like the U.S. to force smaller countries to open their markets, which would then be quickly absorbed. Underdeveloped countries couldn't hope to compete with giants like the U.S., which would, in the end, gobble up an even greater piece of the economic pie.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even some leading free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> defenders concede the same point. Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, chief <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advisor to the Organization of American States (OAS), acknowledges that, while he remains hopeful, there has been no substantial reduction in Latin American poverty after a decade of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization encouraged by Washington. \"Liberalization was not the miracle or the magic formula that many expected,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Objections to the FTAA center on the same point: the pact would diminish the power of nation-states to regulate their own economies and protect their own citizens. Like the 1994 North Atlantic Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the new pact would allow corporations to sue individual governments over any law that might diminish private profit, including legislation that protects consumers, communities, labor and the environment. Already, under Chapter 11 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico has been successfully sued by a U.S. company for trying to protect itself against toxic dumping by blocking the company's expansion plans. And a Canadian firm has sued the U.S., claiming a California anti-air pollution law interferes with profit-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The FTAA would also severely erode controls on foreign investment capital--the same sort of controls that the International Monetary Fund says have been key in providing financial stability in countries ranging from Chile and Colombia to Brazil.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the richest economy in South America and the ninth-biggest in the world, Brazil worries that American corporations would use the FTAA to exploit the abundant resources of the Amazon. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate has become so contentious in Brazil that the recent assassinations of two Workers' Party mayors have been widely interpreted here as an attempt to intimidate Lula and force him to withdraw from the presidential race, thereby silencing a central FTAA critic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But hesitation over FTAA extends beyond Lula's leftist opposition. Recently, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution calling for withdrawal from the current FTAA negotiations with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such opposition also extends into the United States, where there is fear that, as has been the case with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the export of domestic jobs will be greatly accelerated if the FTAA is implemented. Resistance from labor, citizen and environmental groups has been so stiff that, two months ago, when the Bush administration asked for \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" to expedite negotiation of the FTAA, the measure passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote, at a time when Bush was at the height of his post- Sept. 11 popularity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its desperation to ram this measure through Congress, the White House may have done itself more damage than good. Last-minute backroom deals with wavering members of Congress guaranteed more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection for U.S. agricultural interests--not only contradicting the spirit of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but infuriating major trading partners. A few days after the squeaker House vote, Brazil's moderate President Fernando Henrique Cardoso condemned the protectionist measures.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the months to come, as negotiations on FTAA become more intense, so will resistance and protest. U.S. opponents say they will apply the \"Dracula Strategy\" to defeat the pact. \"The more we expose it to the sunlight of public opinion, the more unpopular it will become,\" says Lori M. Wallach of the nonprofit Public Citizen's Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Watch division.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From Brazil and the rest of Latin America, meanwhile, anti-FTAA campaigners will make it clear they are not flat-Earthers opposed to all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements or to greater economic integration. Rather, they will argue that it is the height of cynicism to contend that treating radically unequal partners equally is somehow fair. These critics want a partnership with the U.S.--but a more equitable one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One model frequently cited as more attractive is that of the European Union. When the EU was being formed, \"compensatory\" measures were enacted so that richer countries--like Germany and France--provided significant development aid as well as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and currency advantages to poorer partners like Greece and Portugal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Bush is serious about his promise to help lift Latin Americans out of poverty, he should follow the European example. An FTAA based on the notion that a country like landlocked and impoverished Bolivia can be an equal trading partner with the U.S. will only deepen the hemispheric divide. A more authentic partnership between North and South America would not only establish rules for fair and increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and alleviate the suffocating burden of Southern debt, but would also embody a continental Marshall Plan that would seriously address the currently unsustainable imbalances in education, health care, the environment and human rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no evidence to suggest that Bush is serious about his hemispheric anti-poverty promise, which probably means a rocky road ahead. This might be a good moment, then, for average Americans to start brushing up on the alphabet-soup details of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>) and the FTAA. They're likely to be hearing a lot of angry protesting about these issues in the next few months, and they might want to know what all the shouting is about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER: MATT MAHURIN / For The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to The Nation magazine.

{"id": "293284569.xml", "text": "<h2>'Free Trade' Proves Costly to U.S. Jobs; A somber look at NAFTA shows a boom for businesses on both sides, a bust for workers.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most Americans, good economic news is something they hear about on the nightly news rather than see in their paycheck. While corporate profits are up and productivity is growing, real wages continue to slip. Families are working harder and earning less, and they are angry and frustrated and want to know why.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These passions exploded a few years ago during the debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Editorial writers, economists and the economic elite tried to convince America that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would create jobs and boost pay. But the life experiences of too many working families told them otherwise. They couldn't understand how it was fair to ask American workers to compete directly with workers who earn less than a dollar an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The $12-billion bailout of Mexico didn't help convince them. Neither have the collapse of the peso, the further flight of U.S. jobs or the growing economic instability in Mexico. The arguments in favor of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> seem even less tenable today than they did two years ago. As we recognize the second anniversary of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, we must resist the \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" characterizations that marked the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate. If we don't use this opportunity to honestly study and address the lessons of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, we will never come to a clear understanding of what's happening to the paychecks of America's working families.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ironically, the arguments that ensured <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s passage are rarely heard today. Remember the notion that a burgeoning U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico would create jobs or that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would provide needed support for President Carlos Salinas and his political reforms? Perhaps we haven't heard these arguments lately because the $5.4-billion U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico in 1992 became a deficit topping $11 billion in the first nine months of 1995, and Salinas and his reforms have proved difficult to locate. Instead of a promised 200,000 jobs by the end of last year, 42,000 Americans are already collecting assistance because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and this, by all accounts, is only a small fraction of those displaced.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aren't the dismal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and job numbers a simple reflection of the implosion of the Mexican economy? Not really. Mexico's current economic traumas have accentuated but did not originate two underlying realities: Mexico has continued its trajectory toward becoming a high-tech exporter to the U.S., and Mexico's artificially depressed wages, made much worse by the government's recovery program, are becoming one of its leading and least desirable exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's increasing industrial sophistication could be very good news for both Mexico and the United States except for one salient economic reality: While Mexican productivity heads north, wages continue to head south.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, in the wake of the economic crash, Mexican manufacturing wages are approaching half their 1980 levels. This combination of First World productivity at Third World pay creates a windfall for corporations. Prices for industrial real estate in Tijuana have doubled in the last two years as corporations rush in. Although Mexico's economic troubles have caused the evaporation of 1 million Mexican jobs since last year, Mexico's export assembly plants or maquiladoras have added more than 84,000 jobs since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s passage--more than 30,000 in 1995 alone--to a record 634,000 in June.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an integrated economy, holding down wages in Mexico will be felt in the Midwest. Consider the 600 workers at Halo Lighting in Elk Grove Village, Ill., who averaged $11.67 an hour in the beginning of 1995. Last March, the company announced that it was moving 200 jobs to Mexico, where the falling peso meant it could pay 70 cents an hour. While the news was surely devastating to those who lost their jobs, the 400 workers who remain likely aren't likely to ask for a pay raise anytime soon. The same goes for Fruit of the Loom, which recently announced it was slashing 3,200 American jobs and shifting production to Mexico, where it can pay workers less than $1 an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We all know that America's future is inexorably linked to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, as are the wages of American workers. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is supposed to be the model on which future agreements are based. Too much of the discussion, both during the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate and now, is locked into a false choice between free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> at all. The real issue is the rules of the game that will ensure that ordinary people on both sides of the border benefit from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and we must take steps to address these concerns. If we continue to sign weak <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that ignore wages, labor rights and environmental standards, America's working families are going to continue to pay the price. We can do better, and we must.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: David E. Bonior of Michigan is the House Democratic Whip.

{"id": "293293772.xml", "text": "<h2>PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; Salinas' Fatal Flaw: His Yanqui Vision; It remains inexplicable that he and his technocrats did not see their country as it was rather than as they wished it to be --'American'.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Half a century ago, Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz made the sardonic observation about \"poor Mexico, so far away from God, so near to the United States.\" It was a prophetic description of the essence of Mexico's historical dilemma which remains valid even today as Mexicans reflect upon the tumultuous events that have convulsed their nation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It wasn't supposed to be this way. During his presidency, Carlos Salinas de Gortari had assured his countrymen that his wide-ranging reforms and Mexico's membership in the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement would guarantee all Mexicans an unparalleled future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most Mexicans, Salinas' promises have turned into nightmares, with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> the main villain. But the underlying causes for Mexico's present problems probably can be more accurately traced to a perception of Mexico's future held by the new political elite that came to power in 1988 with Salinas, a perception that, in an ironic historical switch, saw the U.S. as the measure of what they wanted Mexico to become.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Salinas was the first Mexican president to turn his back on the shibboleths of the Mexican Revolution, which saw the U.S. as inimical to Mexican interests. He not only had no deep-seated distrust (or animosity) toward the gringos to the north; he actually admired the American way of doing things and calculated success by American standards and American achievements. This attitude, paradoxically, would play an important role in the chaos that would eventually engulf his country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a strange way, Carlos Salinas regarded his own country with the detachment an American might have. Having studied in the U.S.-- he has a doctorate in economics from Harvard --Salinas adopted a highly businesslike and rational approach to economic development, an approach that downplayed his own country's traditions, especially its authoritarian nature, paternalism and lack of grass-roots democracy and local initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Salinas and the technocrats also operated from another delusionary premise: They saw economic development essentially in abstract terms, as if statistics had a universal validity and life of their own, applicable to any situation, any country, regardless of historical or unique internal factors. Coming from highly privileged backgrounds, they failed to truly grasp the complex realities underlying poverty in developing countries like their own; they underestimated the human dimension. This fatal misconception was to have disastrous consequences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Salinas team was convinced that it could bring Mexico into the so-called First World simply by breaking down protectionist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and reforming archaic, nonproductive agricultural practices. (The attempt to end the traditional ejido family farm system in favor of more productive large holdings helped spark the Indian uprising in Chiapas.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Salinas' self-confidence was contagious --dangerously so. Even normally sober- minded foreign bankers and investors disregarded the warning signs from Mexico's debt forfeiture of a few years earlier and joined the parade to Salinas' new promised land.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, Salinas failed to grasp that the American economic success was not merely the end result of more efficient planning and technology, but also was based on cultural values that differed markedly from those of Mexico. Equally important, the U.S. system did not have to function in an authoritarian environment where corruption was rampant at all levels and the rule of law ignored.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The moment Salinas began precipitously dismantling the Mexican infrastructure, its deficiencies became glaringly apparent. There, lying under the glittering veneer of the much-touted new Mexico of impressive skyscrapers, was, like buried Aztec ruins, the other Mexico, the Mexico that the ever-optimistic technocrats had disregarded, just as the oligarchy had long been accustomed to doing. This was the nation of illiterate indigenous people living as their forebears had in hopeless poverty. Worse, there were 40 million of them. The planners inexplicably ignored the fact that a nation with close to half of its population in this situation, a nation where only half of its children go beyond elementary school, simply was incapable of catapulting itself overnight into the First World.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's accession to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> only exacerbated an already deteriorating situation. The disastrous events that followed were not surprising.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of the responsibility rests with Mexico's ostensibly brightest minds, who, in their desire to be accepted as equals by those they so admired, ignored the reality of their own country and its limitations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, what does the future hold for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing is that Mexico, for better or worse, has crossed its Rubicon. Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, as well as everything else that has happened, there is no going back to the Mexico of the past. Carlos Salinas opened up the expectations of his countrymen to the point where they no longer accept the authoritarian system that ruled them for 67 years. The economic chaos and corruption scandals have discredited both the ruling political elite and the oligarchy. Henceforth, those who claim to govern will increasingly be held accountable for their actions-- a first for Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, too, it no longer is possible to sweep under the carpet the country's glaring socioeconomic problems and inequities, including the violation of human rights, particularly of indigenous people. The rule of law is beginning to take root; corruption and other abuses will come under closer public scrutiny.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most important, there is now a prospect for authentic political pluralism in Mexico, even the possibility of the opposition winning the presidency in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus, despite all the recent traumas, a new Mexico is slowly and painfully being forged. No one can predict how it will turn out, but one thing is certain: It will be a Mexico that finally lives in the present, not the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: HARRY STERLING</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harry Sterling is a former Canadian diplomat who served in Mexico during the Salinas presidency</p>\n"}
{"id": "409156432.xml", "text": "<h2>Dick Gephardt, Unilateralist</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past few months Democrats have been taking aim at the Bush administration's foreign policy, none more forcefully than House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. In a speech on Aug. 2, Gephardt accused the administration of unilateralism and warned that it was being isolated in the world. After listing the usual examples -- missile defense, the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol -- Gephardt declared that these policies violated \"a simple yet profound fact of international relations. One nation, acting alone, cannot possibly build a lasting strategic framework to which all other nations submit.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All valid points, and well articulated. But then what to make of the other Richard Gephardt, the one who declared two weeks earlier that he would insist that any future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement signed by the United States force developing countries to adopt labor standards of Washington's devising, or else face sanctions? The effect of such standards would be to impede entrepreneurship and employment in the very poorest countries in the world. But leave that aside for a moment. Just in terms of the international opposition it would produce, linking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to labor standards is probably the single most polarizing policy position the United States could adopt. It would make missile defense look like a crowd pleaser.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gephardt's insistence on dictating labor standards to the world is particularly hypocritical given that the United States refuses to ratify such standards itself. The International Labor Organization has four \"core standards\": freedom to unionize, no child labor, no prison labor, freedom of association. The United States has ratified only one of them! It's not that we don't believe in or adhere to such standards, but we don't think it proper for international law to trump our national and state laws on something as complex and local as the rights and responsibilities of employers and workers. And yet we would be asking countries such as India, Mexico and Malaysia to do what we will not do ourselves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"How would Americans feel,\" asks Robert Zoellick, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, \"if Europeans were to decide that we fell short of their labor standards because all our workers don't have universal health care? Should they then be able to levy sanctions on us? Labor standards are part of a debate about a country's social policies. It's an important discussion that every country must have. But to stop expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> because of our preferences on this issue would be disastrous. We will break down the world trading system if we insist on it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zoellick is not known for melodrama. In fact, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks have been deadlocked ever since Bill Clinton, in a fit of empathy with the demonstrators at the Seattle World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization meeting, suggested that maybe <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and labor standards should be linked -- contradicting his own administration's policy. Developing countries are now wary of attempts to start a new round of tariff reductions, because they see the labor-standards cry as an attempt to place new burdens on their companies and make them less competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this climate, if the U.S. Congress requires that any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> round contain binding labor standards, the upcoming WTO meeting in Doha, Qatar, will end in failure. And to have the second world-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> meeting -- Seattle being the first -- collapse as the world moves into a global recession is dispiriting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To top it all off, labor standards won't even help American labor. Harvard economist Robert Lawrence explains that \"even if we were to get poor countries to adopt some labor standards, what would that do? Raise the wages of a Chinese worker from $1 an hour to $1.15. Is that going to make American workers able to compete?\" If low wages were the chief magnet for industry, Haiti would be the manufacturing hub of the world. Jobs stay in America because of our workers' high productivity, not their low wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We have had this debate before. In 1993, during the battle over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Gephardt and others paraded across the country prophesying that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would suck jobs out of America and turn Mexico into a cheap-labor hellhole. In fact, jobs on both sides of the border expanded -- high-wage ones in the United States, lower-wage ones in Mexico -- and Mexico opened up its politics and economics. Oh, and its labor standards are higher now than before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This pattern of growth and openness producing progress on labor standards has taken place in South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Chile -- virtually every country in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a way, you have to admire Gephardt's consistency. In the late 1980s he warned that Japan was going to take over the world economy. (Oops!) In the early 1990s, as the U.S. economy slumped, he saw the threat coming from Mexico. In the late 1990s, as America boomed, he began worrying about China. But whatever our imagined ailment, Gephardt's prescription has always been the same: protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this is bad economics, Gephardt obviously thinks it's good politics. Labor unions are at the heart of today's Democratic Party. But even here he is wrong. It took Bill Clinton eight years of hard work to make the Democrats credible on economics and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- this after 20 years of disrepute. Indeed, this is Clinton's greatest achievement, which has transformed the party's image in the country. Now, for dubious political gain and at great economic cost, Richard Gephardt is steadily undermining that legacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is editor of Newsweek International and a columnist for Newsweek.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1985548753.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Courts Economic Mayhem</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump's new National Security Strategy argues that the U.S. must compete in a hostile world. Yet the White House also wants to retreat behind <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. The Trump administration has stacked up a pile of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> cases that will come tumbling down early in 2018. More important than any specific case is the signal of a strategy of economic defeatism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is ready to block steel and aluminum imports through a rarely used \"national security\" rationalization. As an alternative, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had tried negotiating capacity cuts in Chinese production, but Mr. Trump waved him off with a demand for tariffs. Because most of China's metal exports already face U.S. tariffs of more than 80%, Mr. Trump's tactic will likely trigger retaliation from other countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next up are \"safeguards\" to block imports of solar panels and washing machines. Imposing \"safeguards\" doesn't even require a claim of unfairness. On top of this, last year (through Sept. 20) the Commerce Department conducted 65 investigations of alleged low-cost or subsidized imports. That figure is a 16-year high, up 50% from the year before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But these amount to an overture to the big show: likely withdrawal from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement or both. The continuing negotiations to \"fix\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are doomed. Mexico and Canada would probably agree on eliminating barriers and setting new rules for the digital age. But Mr. Trump's real aim is to dictate market outcomes. The administration wants to start with the goal of eliminating the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and then manipulate rules to that end. It wants the U.S. to be excused from keeping its side of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bargain. It wants a five-year sunset clause.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's National Security Strategy covered every region except North America, our home continent and base for projecting power. The administration gives the bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico precedence over areas where our interests align: Asian competition, border security and energy security. Moreover, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals cannot change the economic fundamentals that determine the balance. Mexico and Canada cannot agree to managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or any deal that lets Washington ignore the rules when it chooses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president is trying to placate his political base, which will be enraged if he accepts a deal on \"Dreamer\" immigrants and fails to build his promised border wall. He relies on the support of economic isolationists who find it easier to blame others than to make America more competitive. Killing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would fit the bill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump does not know how to use bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations to create pressure for stronger multilateral rules. The U.S. has historically used bilateral deals not only to eliminate tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers but also to set higher standards for services, agricultural products, intellectual-property protection and more. Such deals have added environmental and labor protections, while boosting anticorruption and transparency rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has used <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to expand the circle of like-minded nations. The Trans-Pacific Partnership included six countries with which the U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, and added five more. That offered leverage with China, but Mr. Trump abandoned the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No country wants to do a bilateral deal with Mr. Trump now because he demands managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not fair competition. He wants excuses to raise barriers, not rules to boost <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. That's why Mr. Trump will use his indictment of China's intellectual-property practices to justify more protectionism, not solve the problems. During the president's recent trip to China, when Beijing proposed opening some of its financial markets to U.S. companies, the Trump team dismissed this as the old way of doing business. The new way is to block Chinese exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some in Congress, with Mr. Trump's backing, want to establish a new technology-control regime under the rubric of screening foreign investment. But government reviews of \"covered transactions\" could apply to countless business deals with foreigners -- licensing, joint development, hiring -- far beyond those involving China. The U.S. already has the authority to block investments and regulate the transfer of technology. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. reviews 200 or so deals a year. Expanding that to many thousands would harm America's competitiveness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are all signs of an America in withdrawal, not one confidently pressing the world to adopt new rules of fair competition and technology security. Farmers and ranchers are fretting that the retaliation triggered by a Fortress America <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy will leave them behind a closed door. Companies that rely on sophisticated supply chains, such as auto makers, will pay a high price.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is abandoning the challenge of setting new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> standards, whether for data, e-commerce or transnational services. America once attracted the world's talent, but Mr. Trump's hostility is driving people away. If he pulls the U.S. out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, even financial markets might recognize that his economic isolationism poses a risk to growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True competitors honestly assess their weaknesses, adapt and then grow stronger. Those are the qualities that made America great. This will be the year that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy could define Trump's fearful America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Zoellick is a former World Bank president, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative and deputy secretary of state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Robert B.

Done with bipartisan bonhomie, the episode illuminates the decay of government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bill Clinton's finest achievement as president, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, passed in December 1993 with more Senate and House support from Republicans (34 and 132) than from Democrats (27 and 102). Many Democrats predicted devastation of U.S.-manufacturing, and Donald Trump was characteristically Cassandra-like. Today manufacturing capacity is 66 percent larger than in 1994. Undeterred by evidence, candidate Trump termed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a 'disaster' and 'the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever signed anywhere.'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As president he is replacing it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is remarkably similar to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with two significant exceptions: It is the first U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement designed to decrease <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and it is larded with Democratic policy objectives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) notes, under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> there were zero tariffs on 100 percent of manufactured goods and 97.5 percent of agricultural products that crossed the three nations' borders. U.S. exports to Mexico increased 500 percent. The USMCA's constructive modernizations of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \" the enormous digital economy did not exist in 1994 \" are, Toomey says, 'mostly taken from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,' which was negotiated by the Obama administration, and for that reason was anathema to Trump. His scrapping of the TPP was a gift to China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA ends free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in automobiles and auto parts with Mexico: By imposing impossible minimum-wage requirements on Mexican factories, the USMCA guarantees that cars and parts will be subject to tariffs \" taxes paid by U.S. consumers. The USMCA also compels Mexico to change its labor laws to promote unionization. And the provision that the USMCA expires in 16 years is, Toomey says, 'designed to have a chilling effect on investment.' He notes that members of Congress who have opposed every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement before this one support it, as does the AFL-CIO, which generally opposes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's substance is regrettable. The process that produced it was even more so because it was lawless.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agreements that fully comply with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority (TPA) cannot be amended and can be passed by a simple majority. But the USMCA did not comply: The implementing legislation was not submitted to Congress 30 days before a committee or floor vote on it, a requirement necessary if Congress is to perform its constitutional duty to establish <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Also, the TPA requires that the implementing legislation contain only provisions 'strictly necessary or appropriate' for implementation. Otherwise, the TPA's expedited process could be used to sneak extraneous matters into law without adequate scrutiny, or possible opposition through amendment, or a 60-vote threshold. But for the first time ever, implementing legislation contained appropriations, $843 million, including $50 million for salaries and expenses for the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative, which was designated an 'emergency.'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate and its once-formidable Finance Committee are, Toomey believes, being 'marginalized' and made 'irrelevant' as the executive wields authority delegated to it by Congress \" but without Congress insisting on compliance with the terms of the delegation. The question, Toomey says, is: 'Are we willing to enforce our own law that governs the proceedings of this body?'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) felt similarly in December when Congress 'passed a $1.4 trillion spending extravaganza, complete with half a trillion dollars in tax cuts and a bevy of favors for special interests \" all without debate and without committee consideration, based on decisions made by the bill's sponsors over a weekend.' The $300 billion 'Cadillac tax,' a restraint on lavish employer-provided health plans, was repealed. This demonstrated that Congress cannot repeal Obamacare but will not pay for it. Amendments were not allowed, debate was limited to 90 minutes, and the Senate voted on the bill less than three days after it was unveiled. 'Senate leadership clearly didn't want it to be understood or discussed,' Cassidy said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 116th Congress, now in its second year, there have been, Toomey notes, votes on just 20 amendments \" one was a 'sense of the Senate' legal nullity, four were 'noncontroversial or largely devoid of substance,' six 'were killed using a procedural maneuver,' and none of the other nine 'came close to passage.' The Finance Committee has held one substantive markup in 13-months.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's institutional vandalism is partially explained, although not excused, by the breadth and depth of his ignorance concerning the manners and mores of a republic.

Late on Friday, he indefinitely suspended the tariffs. If revived, the duties would increase 5 percent every month, up to 25 percent unless Mexico stops the migration wave from Central America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without question, there has been a substantial uptick in migrants leaving Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, traveling across Mexico in an effort to reach the United States.

It would not encourage people from the Northern Triangle to stay home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor would tariffs that tax American companies and consumers help Mexico deal with the refugee problem. In fact, tariffs would make matters much worse. Shrinking U.S. demand for Mexican products would not only diminish Mexico's already stressed resources to deal with the migration influx, but it would also weaken Mexico's economy, causing that nation to lose jobs and eventually shed workers. Ironically, these tariffs would more</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>likely</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>stimulate an even larger number of migrants seeking to cross our southern border in search of increased prosperity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, tariffs would</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>adversely affect the U.S. economy. Our farmers, already hurt by the  U.S.-China tariff war, would feel even more pain. Mexico is our second-largest</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>export destination. This year, Mexico has been our largest purchaser of corn. Since we entered the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, our agricultural exports to Mexico are up 500 percent</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>. We can expect that tariffs would cause our exports to shrink considerably.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With respect to manufacturing, our supply chains are tightly linked. On average, the products that we import from Mexico contain 40 percent U.S. content; that compares with 2 percent from Japan and 4 percent from China. And much of what we import from Mexico are intermediate goods that enhance our productivity and make our exports more competitive. We don't just buy goods from one another; we make things together. Auto parts cross our southern border as many as eight times. Imposing a 5 percent tariff on each crossing would make the end product far less competitive. Fewer sales means fewer jobs. Today, the economic linkage between our two economies supports 5 million U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of these problems would worsen with tariffs,</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>for we could expect sharp retaliation from Mexico. We could also expect Mexico to rethink its support for our updated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with it and Canada, thus creating future  uncertainty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the economic impacts, the threat of these tariffs is corroding the close relationship we have built with our southern neighbor. The increased vibrancy of our post-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> economic relationship has enhanced our security collaboration. Our two governments have worked closely together, sharing intelligence that has enabled us to reduce the reach of organized crime. It was that collaboration that enabled the capture of El Chapo, the kingpin of the Sinaloa drug cartel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is not as if Mexico is ignoring the migration problem. In May it apprehended more than 22,000 unauthorized immigrants, and over the past six months it has returned more than 80,000 migrants to Central America. But Mexico's immigration agencies, like ours, are overwhelmed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to the updated March 28, 2019,</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>report by the Congressional Research Service:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In February 2018, the State Department set forth a framework for U.S. policy toward the region focused on three pillars for engagement - economic growth and prosperity, security, and democratic governance. Although the framework reflects continuity with long-standing U.S. policy priorities for the region, it also appears to be at odds with the Administration's actions. . . . The Administration's proposed foreign aid budget for FY2018 and FY2019 would have significantly cut assistance to the region by more than a third; the FY2020 proposed budget request also would cut funding to the region by about 30%.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the president is genuinely concerned about the northern march of migrants, the administration needs to put its money where its mouth is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs are not an effective tool to deal with immigration issues. Indeed, they would make  matters much worse. Far better to work with Mexico and, where possible, other regional leaders to begin to address the root causes for the increased migration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer served as the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative from 1989 to 1993 and was the primary U.S. negotiator of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1825170055.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Nafta Mistakes Are Huge</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Donald Trump said during the first presidential debate that the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) \"is the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\" Such hyperbolic rhetoric -- butchered syntax and all -- was undoubtedly cheered by his base. But it is not supported by the facts. As a result it harms his case with Republican holdouts, whom Mr. Trump needs to win but who distrust his fast-and-loose economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican is promising to force a renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But he doesn't seem to realize that Mexico gave up more tariff protection than the U.S. did when the agreement was signed in 1993. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is reopened, Mexico is unlikely to accept new limits on its access to the U.S. market. If a standoff leads to the end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, both countries would revert to their commitments under World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization rules and the existing \"most-favored nation\" tariff schedule. That would hurt, not help, the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is so reckless on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that he makes Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, who wrote the book on Big Labor protectionism, seem sane. At least she acknowledged in the debate the importance of opening new markets abroad. \"We are 5% of the world's population. We have to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the other 95%,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately neither of the candidates is good on this critical issue but the Republicans advising Mr. Trump should know better. His attempt to slam <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> by pointing to a 16% value-added tax that Mexican importers pay, for example, is misleading. This tax applies to transactions on both foreign and domestic-made goods, like the New York sales tax. It doesn't discriminate against imports, and the importer recovers it by charging it to the customer. That's Econ 101.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> disrupted the economic status quo in the U.S. -- as it did in Mexico. There have been winners and losers. But the U.S. dislocations are minor compared with those that occur from technological advances or when companies move production from high-tax, union-dominated U.S. states to low-tax, right-to-work states, and especially so when compared with the economic efficiencies gained.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump gave a quick nod to one genuine U.S. disadvantage during the debate when he talked about cutting U.S. corporate tax rates to spur investment at home. But his main message was that under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico is \"stealing\" U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, an interconnected North American economy has made U.S. manufacturing globally competitive. U.S. companies source components from Mexico and Canada and add value in innovation, design and marketing. The final outputs are among the most high-quality, low-price products in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. automotive competitiveness is highly dependent on global free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. According to the Mexico City-based consulting firm De la Calle, Madrazo, Mancera, 37% of the U.S.'s imported auto components came from Mexico and Canada in 2015. This sourcing from abroad is important to good-paying U.S. auto-assembly jobs. But parts also flow the other way. U.S. parts manufacturers sent 61% of their exports to Mexico and Canada in 2015.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This synergy has made the U.S. auto industry attractive for investment. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis investment in the auto sector contracted. But from 2010-14 almost $70 billion was invested in the North American automotive industry. Mr. Trump claims that investment is going to Mexico but two-thirds of it went into the U.S., according to a January 2015 report by the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This investment dynamism helped generate 264,800 new U.S. jobs in motor-vehicle production and parts between January 2010 and June 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a 40% increase in employment despite the increasing trend toward robotics in the industry. Shut down <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and these workers and future job seekers will pay.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. agriculture would also suffer. U.S. farm products now enter Mexico practically tariff-free and in 2013 (the latest year that data is available) it was the third-largest foreign market for U.S. farm output after China and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's suppose that Mexico won't give up ground in a new round of negotiations and Mr. Trump is successful in leading the repeal of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That would mean a reversion back to the WTO-agreed duties that each country charges nations without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. In 2013 Mexico's weighted average tariff on agricultural products was 38.4%, which would be quite a climb over the zero tariff-rate that U.S. exporters now face. U.S. manufacturers that ship to Mexico would be hit with a weighted average tariff on industrial goods of 7.7%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Keep in mind that Mexico has many bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Competitors from those countries would have large duty-free advantages over American farmers and manufacturers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's outlandishness is supposed to be one of his strengths. But when it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> he is not politically incorrect. He is factually incorrect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Trump's Right: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Has Been Loser for U.S.\" -- WSJ October 14, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "2115077957.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA 2.0, with a splash of TPP</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, that was unnecessarily painful.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After spending a year and a half alienating our friends, punishing our farmers and manufacturers with devastating tariffs and counter-tariffs, and fracturing the hard-won alliance we had built to isolate and pressure China, we finally got a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal - and a \"new\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet somehow, they look an awful lot like the old ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sunday evening, news broke that Canada agreed to the terms of a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Not merely renegotiated: rebranded! What was once the easily pronounceable \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" will hereafter be the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or \"USMCA.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the name change was needed is a little unclear. Our marketer in chief clearly loves rebranding things, and USMCA, while it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does have the virtue of literally putting America first. Oddly, the posted text of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact itself still repeatedly refers to itself as \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2018.\" I guess someone forgot to search-and-replace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to the substance, well, the best you can say is it could have been a whole lot worse. President Trump didn't, as he threatened, blow up the system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, you know, whoop de doo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some new protectionist measures, such as complicated new requirements for auto rules of origin, which could potentially backfire. That is, they may end up being so costly to adhere to that they'll encourage manufacturers to move more of their operations and jobs outside of North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other stuff, such as a \"sunset\" provision requiring members to regularly reaffirm their desire to continue the three-party deal, is probably also not an improvement. There are better ways to encourage ongoing modernization of the deal that would involve less policy uncertainty for businesses. But, again, this section is not as bad as many businesses and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also won some modest concessions in tiny industries he's weirdly obsessed with, such as Canadian dairy. He has conveniently played down the concessions he made in exchange: In return for greater American access to the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg markets, we gave Canada greater access to U.S. markets for dairy, peanuts, processed peanut products, sugar and sugar-containing products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the most part, despite Trump's assertion that \"it's not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> redone, it's a brand-new deal,\" the president mostly kept <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> intact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, some of the more significant changes - relating to issues such as labor standards, environmental protections and e-commerce - appear to be cribbed from another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that Trump has demonized: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you (like me) supported TPP, this is either reassuring or supremely frustrating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Barack Obama negotiated TPP - a 12-party pact that included Canada and Mexico - as part of his own promise to \"renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" TPP was also Obama's strategy for keeping China from writing \"the rules of the road\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. China was deliberately excluded from the pact, which was designed to cement a coalition of countries that had been wounded by China's misbehavior. Working together, these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> victims hoped to pressure China to reform.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's first orders of business as president, of course, was to pull out of TPP. He soon thereafter picked unnecessary <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fights with TPP countries we'd previously tried to make common cause with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Trump seems to have realized his mistake. Despite how he characterizes his \"historic transaction,\" the USMCA is mostly just a smooshing together of two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that he derided as the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals ever made, as Dartmouth Tuck School of Business professor Emily Blanchard points out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, a bunch of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 language appears squarely aimed at returning to Obama's alliance strategy for isolating China - which, to reiterate, only requires rebuilding because Trump destroyed it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>- replacement deal includes \"protections against misappropriation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets, including by state-owned enterprises,\" one of China's major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sins. Likewise, there's also language designed to disincentivize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 signatories from making free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with \"non-market\" countries, widely understood to be targeting China. Some have speculated that Trump may press for similar language in negotiations with other countries, such as Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, Trump has wrought a lot of destruction in service of landing us in roughly the same position we would have been in had we simply stayed in TPP and pursued more amicable negotiations with Mexico and Canada on other outstanding issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of these harms - such as the steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures that, despite Sunday's announcement, remain on the books - may yet be reversible. But the damage to our reputation as a reliable trading partner and ally may be irreparable. To Trump, that may be a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Catherine Rampell</p>\n"}
{"id": "409878412.xml", "text": "<h2>A Toxic Trade-off</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pressing for passage of the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement at a White House news conference in May, President Bush made the case that a vote for CAFTA was a vote for democracy: \"By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area, we will promote democratic governance, human rights and economic liberty for everyone,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But lawmakers who voted to pass CAFTA in late July may not have realized that a part of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement threatens to do just the opposite. That's because of a little-understood legal clause included in CAFTA, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), and other, already existing bilateral investment treaties. Designed to protect foreign investors against unfair treatment by a signatory state, these \"investor-state arbitration\" provisions actually hand foreign businesses powerful rights that trump the interests or desires of local citizens.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the example of the current bid by U.S.-Canadian corporation Glamis Gold Ltd. to mine the ore in Guatemala's Western highlands. Local community and church leaders have vigorously protested the company's plans to dig an open-pit gold and silver mine in the department of San Marcos. They contend that the mining process, which uses cyanide to extract gold from ore, could leach deadly toxins into the surrounding water supply. After construction began in 2004, the indigenous poor --  who make up most of the region's population and depend on scarce local water  --  began protesting the mine. They continued for months into this year, even though the government dispatched the military to quell the protests and local leaders reportedly received death threats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to these health and safety concerns, the government of Guatemala could decide either to ban the cyanide process or to require the company to compensate surrounding communities for their risk. The vice president has said that the government wouldn't do anything the people don't want. But stopping the Glamis project now could be costly: Under CAFTA, the government of Guatemala could be liable for tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can a multinational corporation that objects to local environmental, health or safety regulations sue a national government? That license is provided under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Once CAFTA is signed, it will provide the same right. In each case, a provision of the agreement allows a foreign corporation to sue a national government for money damages if it believes that the actions of the federal, state or local government in a given country are discriminatory, violate international law or can be considered  --  directly or indirectly  --  an expropriation of the company's investment. If complying with an environmental regulation makes a project no longer worth the cost, a company can claim that its investment has been expropriated by the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether the company is in the right won't be decided by an independent judge, however. Rather, it will be decided by a panel of three private international arbitrators chosen by the parties involved. These arbitrators are often corporate lawyers, who, in another suit, could be representing the investor. Affected citizens are not parties to the case. The government's right to protect the water supply in Guatemala, then, could be decided by British or American lawyers, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it's not just a matter of a powerful multinational corporation challenging a struggling Central American country. In fact, Glamis, the company that's digging the mine in Guatemala, has already brought a similar legal action against the United States. In 2003, Glamis filed for arbitration under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, claiming that environmental and historic preservation regulations passed in California after the company had received a federal permit to dig there amount to an expropriation. The regulations, championed by then-governor Gray Davis in response to strong local protests, require that open-pit gold mines be backfilled and returned to their pre-mined condition after the ore has been depleted. Claiming that the cost of backfilling would destroy the future economic value of its project, Glamis brought a $50 million claim against the United States. (The matter hasn't been resolved yet.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Defenders of arbitration provisions claim that critics' concerns are overblown, and emphasize that, unlike Canada and Mexico, the United States has yet to lose one of these cases. Still, many legal experts argue that the provisions violate state and national sovereignty: They allow foreign investors to make an end-run around the federal courts, which usually rule on the legitimacy of public laws. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s adoption: \"Article III of our Constitution reserves to federal courts the power to decide cases and controversies, and the U.S. Congress may not delegate to another tribunal 'the essential attributes of judicial power.' Whether our Congress has done so with respect to tribunals created by different treaties and agreements is a critical question.\" John Echeverria, executive director of Georgetown University's Environmental Law and Policy Institute, puts it more starkly: \"Congress is virtually sleepwalking through a revolutionary, and likely highly destructive, alteration of the American constitutional system of government.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Echeverria is referring to the threat to U.S. sovereignty when, for example, the Canadian division of Glamis challenges the legitimacy of a California law by suing the United States. With agreements like CAFTA between rich and poor countries, the sovereignty question also has another, more sinister twist: Although these treaties protect corporations against the vagaries of unpredictable governments, they can also make it easier for corrupt national leaders to ignore the interests of their own populations and sign lucrative contracts with foreign corporations. This is a longstanding problem with extractive industries like mining and the countries that depend on them. And this sort of corruption is one reason why poverty in those countries has soared in recent decades. According to the United Nations, in 1981, 61 percent of people in mineral and energy exporting countries were living on less than $1 per day; by 1999, that number was 82 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, companies need some protections when they invest. If Guatemala suddenly nationalized its mining industry, for example, seizing all foreign-owned mines, foreign corporations would understandably be aggrieved. But enacting environmental, health or safety regulations is a different matter. The United States Supreme Court has made clear that even if a regulation significantly reduces the value of a company's investment, the government needn't compensate that loss. Environmental regulations are part of the cost of doing business. It's far cheaper to dump toxic waste into a river than to dispose of it safely, but we still want our government to impose the cost of safe disposal on companies creating the hazard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The mining industry spews almost half of all toxic emissions in some countries, in the process ruining local agriculture and causing a substantial boost in respiratory disorders and raising cancer rates,\" according to a recent, critical report on investor arbitration rights written by Oxfam America and Friends of the Earth. Mining will only encourage real development, they conclude, if it's properly regulated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasingly, people in developing countries are demanding just that. And it's a sign of progress. If democratically elected governments enacted laws in response to these legitimate concerns, that would be another important step; in fact, it'd be exactly what we want \"developing\" countries to do. And it's what the United States government claims to be encouraging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, with the proliferation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment agreements that hand foreign investors surprisingly broad rights, local governments are losing the power to protect their people, environment and economy. Investor protection clauses \"essentially restrict the ability of governments to impose public interest or environmental regulations on corporate operations,\" says Keith Slack, an extractive industries expert for Oxfam America. And this hinders the very sort of development that would, in the long run, make poor countries not only better places for people to live, but far better places for American corporations to do business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These arbitration provisions also highlight the inconsistency of the Bush administration's approach to sovereignty under international law. According to many legal experts (including lawyers now bringing these claims), the significance of investor- state arbitration provisions, which wasn't clear at the time <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was enacted under the Clinton administration, in the last few years has become so. The Bush administration has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gases and the treaty creating the International Criminal Court on the grounds that these treaties threaten U.S. sovereignty. But when it came time to push for Congressional support of CAFTA and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts that compromise U.S. sovereignty for the benefit of big business, the administration's concerns about the integrity of our legislative and judicial system had disappeared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The debate over these sorts of agreements isn't over whether or not to have \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" All <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is regulated  --  just a quick glance at the 22 chapters of CAFTA alone makes that plain. The conflict is over which rules will make the liberalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefit both foreign investors and local villagers. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that binds the hands of local governments for the benefit of foreign corporations will only undermine democracy  --  and in the long run, global development itself.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>daphneeviatar@earthlink.net</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daphne Eviatar is a contributing editor at the American Lawyer and a 2005 fellow with the Alicia Patterson Foundation.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398985904.xml", "text": "<h2>Lumbering Along</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week's agreement to remove American duties on Canadian softwood lumber imports, after more than 20 years of litigation, is being celebrated by U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Rep Rob Portman as \"a smart, market-based solution.\" But for U.S. consumers and foreign producers -- otherwise known as \"the market\" -- the deal is worthy of one and a half cheers at best.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The accord is a political victory for President Bush and Canada's new Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who had vowed to resolve the longstanding dispute that had soured <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations between the two countries -- each of which is the other's biggest trading partner. The good news is that the lawyers go away and tariff duties are lifted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in return, \"the market\" had to make two major concessions. First, the two nations agreed not to let free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> continue if the price of framing lumber drops below $355 per thousand board feet. Below that level, a new Canadian export tax kicks in; the further the price drops, the higher the tax goes. Since most softwood imports are used in new-home construction, this hardly helps make U.S. housing more affordable (amid rising mortgage rates).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, the agreement allows the U.S. lumber industry to keep $1 billion of the $5 billion in illegal duties collected by the U.S. since 2002, a kind of extortion payment to get rid of the lawyers and lobbyists. Half of the U.S. winnings will go right into the pockets of domestic producers that filed for protection.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true that without this agreement, lawyers for U.S. producers were prepared to tie Canadian loggers up in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> litigation for another 25 years. The fact that the U.S. duties had been declared illegal at least 11 times by review panels of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement apparently mattered little.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission accepted the panel's instructions and ruled in favor of Canada in 2004. Washington responded with allegations of a conflict of interest on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel, a challenge it lost last August. The Bush Administration still refused to lift the duties and refund what had already been collected. The $5 billion had become a bargaining chip for the U.S. and a signal to the industry that endless litigation could also be profitable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no way to brush off the dangerous precedent set here by the assault on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the arrogant disregard for its dispute-settlement mechanism. The lesson U.S. trading partners will take away -- and not just <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners -- is that antidumping and countervailing-duty laws are now official U.S. tools of managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. A lawsuit strategy can bury the competition under years of appeals -- during which illegal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers can provide years of protection -- until it cries uncle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. may feel victorious, but a trend toward more managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is bound to suffocate competition and set a dangerous precedent that other nations are sure to follow.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2047940134.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Steel Destruction</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So much for Donald Trump as genius deal-maker. We are supposed to believe his tariff threats are a clever negotiation strategy, but on Thursday he revealed he's merely an old-fashioned protectionist. His decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe, Canada and Mexico will hurt the U.S. economy, his own foreign policy and perhaps Republicans in November.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In March Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross dangled temporary exemptions to 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs to extort <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> concessions from U.S. allies. Mr. Ross withdrew the exemptions on Thursday, saying the U.S. \"was unable to reach satisfactory arrangements\" with Canada, Mexico and the European Union. He means they didn't unilaterally surrender.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ross announced the tariffs under Section 232 of the 1962 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Expansion Act ostensibly to circumvent the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization. WTO rules let countries adopt tariffs to protect national security, but Canada, Mexico and Europe are hardly a threat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canadian steel and aluminum are actually integral to U.S. national defense, as Commerce's Section 232 reports acknowledge. Mr. Trump complained that Lockheed's F-35s cost too much, but now he's going to make U.S. fighter jets and other weapons more expensive, which could give Russia an advantage in international arms sales. Brilliant. Another irony is that Mr. Trump has denounced China for using national security as a pretext to promote domestic industries like semiconductors. He's essentially doing the same.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American businesses rely on complex cross-border supply chains that take time and money to change. Most will have to internalize the tariff costs, which will mean raising prices or hiring fewer workers and paying lower wages. The tariffs also create uncertainty as businesses petition Commerce for product exemptions while delaying investment. Note to Mr. Trump: Regulatory uncertainty was a big reason growth was so slow during the Obama years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Taxing steel and aluminum imports will make U.S. manufacturers less competitive. Prior to Thursday's announcement, U.S. steel prices were up 40% this year and nearly 50% over the European benchmark. How does punishing American manufacturers square with Mr. Trump's goal of making more cars in America?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ross has dismissed the impact on consumers, but a 25% increase in input costs is nothing to sniff at. Companies use imported steel and aluminum in everything from cars to beer cans to Hershey's kisses wrappers. The Federal Reserve in April reported that a maker of tractor trailers said that it \"can't raise prices as fast as material costs.\" A toy manufacturer in the Northeast that uses a thin-gauge aluminum foil said the tariffs had raised its prices three-fold.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fallout, not least to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Canada provides 43% of U.S. aluminum imports -- more than twice as much as China and Russia combined. Mexico and Canada together account for about a fifth of U.S. steel imports compared to China's 2% and Russia's 9%. As Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse tweeted, \"You don't treat allies the same way you treat opponents.\" On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Mr. Trump treats them worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is already in jeopardy due to excessive U.S. demands that include a wage mandate on autos and a five-year sunset. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that he recently offered to visit the White House to close a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal. But Vice President Mike Pence told him he'd have to accept a five-year <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> sunset. Mr. Trudeau rightly said no Canadian leader would agree to such a self-defeating provision.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, other countries are retaliating. Europe has teed up tariffs of up to 50% on $3.3 billion of U.S. products including bourbon, motorboats, cranberries and playing cards. Canada plans to hit up to $12.8 billion in products including U.S. steel, yogurt, hair lacquers, beer kegs and sailboats. Mexico announced tariffs on U.S. steel, lamps, pork, apples, grapes and cheese. Many items on the tariff lists overlap because they target states that Mr. Trump won and House districts where Republicans have competitive races.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which means that President Trump's gambit could backfire politically. Mexico is America's biggest apple export market. Washington Rep. Dave Reichert says apple and pear exports to Mexico increased by 70% after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Wisconsin produces more than half of the nation's cranberries whose biggest export markets are the Netherlands and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats have bought billboards in California's Central Valley denouncing the impact of Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies on farmers. Even steel manufacturers will take a hit since Canada buys about half of U.S. steel exports while Mexico imports about 40%. The steelworkers union supported an exemption for Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump has been establishing a solid economic record with tax cuts and deregulation, but his escalating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war puts that at risk. He aspires to be Ronald Reagan but his tariff folly echoes of Herbert Hoover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

The most the Administration could bring itself to say is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has had a ''modest positive effect'' on the American economy. That's a far cry from the extravagant promises made by the accord's proponents during the 1993 debate: ''Hundreds of thousands of new jobs! Higher wages! A cleaner environment! Just you wait and see!''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They were wrong. The facts are in.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three hundred thousand new jobs? No. The report, required by Congress, suggests that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-related exports have created 90,000 to 160,000 new jobs. But those figures don't account for the 132,000 Americans who have lost their jobs as a result of the agreement. That's the number of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-related job losses certified under the Labor Department's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Adjustment Assistance Program, set up to help displaced American workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higher wages? No. Mexican wages along the border have dropped from $1 to 70 cents an hour, according to International Monetary Fund figures. A 1996 Cornell University study commissioned by the Labor Department found that 62 percent of U.S. companies surveyed have used the threat of moving to Mexico to hold down wages here at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Environmental cleanup? No. Toxic sites along the border have continued to multiply. To date, only 1 percent of the $2 billion in cleanup funds promised under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have been spent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Administration's report ignores these facts, trying to put the best face on an agreement that clearly hasn't delivered on its promises.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has risen between the United States and Mexico in the last three years, but it has been lopsided. Imports from Mexico have surged by 83 percent since 1993. What was a $2 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> became a record $16 billion deficit last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-generated exports are costing us jobs. More and more, multinationals are shipping components to Mexico, so they can be assembled by low-wage workers, then sent right back as finished products to the United States. According to an analysis by the University of California economist Harley Shaiken, these revolving-door exports have more than doubled, from $18 billion in 1993 to $42 billion last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So who does benefit from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Some of the big winners are the 28 core members of USA-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, an industry group that lobbied for the agreement. Forty-two percent of these multinationals shipped jobs abroad once <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was adopted, an analysis of the Labor Department's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adjustment assistance data shows. Their profits have increased by 296 percent, according to financial information published in Forbes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s toll cannot be measured only in economic terms. The Administration's report also ignores real threats to our health and safety.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Imports of Mexican fruit have increased 45 percent since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was enacted, and vegetable imports have gone up by 31 percent, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported this year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This produce rolls into the United States on 3.3 million trucks a year. Fewer than 1 percent of these trucks are inspected at the border, according to a May 1997 study by the General Accounting Office. That means parasites, pesticides and infectious diseases go undetected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, the Environmental Working Group found that 18.4 percent of imported Mexican strawberries contain ''very high rates of illegal pesticides.''</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Earlier this year in Michigan, 179 children became seriously ill after eating contaminated Mexican strawberries. Shouldn't such incidents argue for stiffer inspections of imported produce? Unbelievably, under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, such inspections could be considered an unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> restriction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This appalling lack of inspections is also encouraging the drug <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

{"id": "398439084.xml", "text": "<h2>Counterpoint: Rescue Nafta--Safeguard the environment</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Are you trying to kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the courts?\" one reporter asked recently when U.S. District Court Judge Charles Richey ruled that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Office is obligated to write an environmental impact statement on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Is the Sierra Club, which was a plaintiff in the case, out to get <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> one way or another?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The answer is \"no.\" The Sierra Club is not a protectionist group. We have no quarrel with reducing and removing tariffs. We are not inserting ourselves in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to create havoc.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, the environment is affected by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Past <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have already aggravated environmental conditions along the U.S.-Mexican border, and this one could make them worse. If the agreement does produce economic benefits, it will do so by increasing industrialization -- and that brings pollution with it. We could end up with twice as many factories along the border, even if some new ones are built in the interior of Mexico for its own market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question is whether there is any assurance that a reasonable portion of the added economic benefits will be plowed back into preventing and abating that pollution. The present agreement provides no assurance that will be done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The present agreement relies on a parallel agreement that lacks any teeth and a mechanism to regularly provide funding. We estimate that it will cost $20 billion to clean up conditions along our southern border. Vague hopes that more wealth will translate into concrete action are likely to leave us as disappointed as in the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The American Medical Association has found the border environment to be a \"virtual cesspool.\" U.S. authorities had hoped that all toxic wastes produced in assembly plants just across the border would be returned to the U.S. for safe processing. Almost none of them have been. Concrete plans with funding and cleanup schedules are needed, as are commitments to action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If a really good border cleanup plan were to be developed, the environmental community would have something to gain with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. As it is, the plan is nothing but words promising more discussion and meetings -- and inaction. It will follow in the wake of the empty La Paz agreement of 1983.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement is also controversial with environmentalists because it intrudes into the field of environmental policy-setting. It is not just about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>; it is about how the parties set standards for pollution control, about how strict they can be, and about what states and localities can do. It is about hamstringing the sovereignty of the U.S. government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the negotiations had steered clear of trying to tell our government what it can do in the environmental field, we would be much less concerned. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> does intrude in ways that can cast a cloud on our ability to have the strong programs the American public wants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, it infringes on U.S. laws regulating the safety of imported foods -- setting bizarre requirements that laws governing pesticide residues may not be able to meet. It would create obligations to move our pollution laws toward international standards, which generally lag behind ours. This would push us toward weakening our laws. It would expose the states to pressures to weaken their laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would also put a great body of U.S. wildlife laws at odds with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. These are laws such as those preventing the import of elephant ivory, preventing the import of wild birds from the tropics, and keeping tuna that is not dolphin-safe out of our country. Similarly affected would be shrimp taken in ways that endanger sea turtles and fish taken with drift nets and from countries that are engaged in whaling in violation of treaty requirements. Moreover, our ability to enter into future environmental treaties would be clouded by the need to gain permission from Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Efforts were made by the Bush administration to address some of these problems, but the fixes were limited and are often contradicted by other language that was not changed. It is quite likely that the rest of these problems could be fixed if there were a will to do so. However, the Clinton administration so far has refused to entertain the question. Because it has agreed not to \"renegotiate\" the agreement, it has refused to look seriously at clarifying the agreement's intent and at protocols that might be negotiated to resolve these environmental problems.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration has agreed to tackle the enforcement problem. While we are not entirely satisfied with its approach, it is nonetheless a serious effort to prevent U.S. industry from fleeing to Mexican havens where enforcement of pollution laws is lax. Where there is a \"persistent and unjustifiable pattern of lax enforcement,\" there would be a remedy. But Mexico is stonewalling the idea. It is still hopeful that it can lure industry with lax enforcement. Inexplicably, Canada is supporting Mexico.

Unfortunately, the Clinton administration is beginning to act in a proprietary way about the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> it has inherited. The administration is finding reasons not to tackle most of these problems. It is taking an inflexible position on the question of doing an environmental impact statement, but such a statement could give it breathing room to get a firm grip on the best way to resolve these problems. It has fecklessly put itself on a schedule for wrapping up negotiations that throws away bargaining leverage. It is acting as if its future is tied to getting this agreement through with only minimal change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That attitude may only worsen <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s prospects in the House.

But why, with a rival so highly unlikable, is GOP candidate Donald Trump unable to excite a wider number of voters?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One glaring problem is that Mr. Trump, who has an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, fails economics. Exhibit A is his promise to shred the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) on the grounds that Mexico, his favorite b\u00eate noire, is stealing American jobs. It is technology, not free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, that is behind the shrinking number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> like a pi\u00f1ata worked in the Republican primary. But it is likely to hurt Mr. Trump and GOP candidates further down the ticket in the general election. Mexico is, after all, the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner and second-largest export market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tirades undermine his credibility with voters who know better. And that's a lot of voters. Americans from every walk of life are beneficiaries of U.S. global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indiana, the home of GOP vice-presidential candidate Gov. Mike Pence, exported some $4.8 billion of goods to Mexico in 2015, making it the state's second-largest export market. That included $1.5 billion in transportation equipment, $1.4 billion in machinery and $88 million in corn-fructose products. More than 120,000 Hoosier jobs depend on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exports to Mexico were over $1 billion in 31 states in 2015. It's the largest export market for California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It ranks second for 25 other states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To hear the Trump campaign tell it, American workers who don't want to increase protectionism are coddled members of the \"elite.\" Yet the majority of people employed in today's globally connected, tech-driven U.S. economy hail from middle-class families who made financial sacrifices to prepare them to compete in the modern workforce. It's dispiriting to hear the GOP nominee denigrate achievers and try to pit Americans against one another.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higher tariffs on U.S. imports will be passed on to American consumers, many of whom are already hurting economically due to the sluggish Obama recovery. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> wars will also damage U.S. competitiveness. As former Mexican deputy <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> minister Luis de la Calle explained in a conference call to investors in New York earlier this month, Carrier Corp.'s production move to Mexico from Indiana--much-assailed by Mr. Trump--means that the company can survive Asian competition and can retain U.S. jobs in research, development, marketing and high-end components.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the biggest lie that Mr. Trump peddles is that higher tariffs can restore lost U.S. manufacturing jobs. They won't, and to suggest otherwise is a cruel hoax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a recent Foreign Affairs magazine essay   titled \"The Truth About <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>,\" Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin observes that while technology has \"enabled vast productivity and efficiency improvements,\" it has \"also made many blue-collar jobs obsolete.\" Mr. Irwin cites a study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, which \"found that productivity growth accounted for more than 85 percent of the job loss in manufacturing between 2000 and 2010, a period when employment in that sector fell by 5.6 million.\" This 85% compares, according to the study, with 13% of job losses attributed to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> during the same period. In other words, to bring most jobs back, Mr. Trump would have to outlaw mechanization. Will Mr. Pence break the news to Indiana farmers?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a paper   published last summer in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, MIT economist David Autor unpacks the reason automation has hit the middle-class hard. He observes that in order to write code for a task, a programmer must be able to \"enunciate the explicit 'rules' or procedures\" necessary to do it. But tasks understood by humans \"tacitly\" are not easy to automate. Mr. Autor calls this constraint \"Polanyi's paradox\" after the Hungarian-born chemist and economist who observed that \"we know more than we can tell.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is \"high-education\" and \"low-education\" jobs--requiring \"interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem solving\"--that are most difficult to automate Mr. Autor notes. Traditional middle-education jobs have been the easiest to replace with technology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet there is also strong evidence of adaptation in the middle of the pack. Mr. Autor cites a couple of economists who have identified evidence of new job creation for this group. The catch, he says, is that \"human capital investment must be at the heart of any long-term strategy for producing skills that are complemented by rather than substituted for by technological change.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protectionism is populist demagoguery and will only impoverish the middle class. Many Americans see through Mr. Trump's false promises, which is one reason he's in a tight race despite Hillary's high negatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}

{"id": "1731706447.xml", "text": "<h2>Memo to Trump: Nafta Helps Americans; Levying tariffs on Mexico to pay for a border wall would launch a trade war.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. manufacturing grew in October at its slowest pace in more than two years, according to Institute for Supply Management data released last week  . Analysts put the blame on a feeble global economy and a strong dollar.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), manufacturing would be in even worse shape. But don't tell Donald Trump that. If elected president, he promises to \"make America great again\" by, among other things, blowing up the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's campaign speeches have provided few details about how he intends to govern. But one specific pledge he has made repeatedly is to build a \"beautiful\" wall across the Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is not about to voluntarily foot the bill for any such wall. But Mr. Trump says that he can make our neighbor pay by imposing new tariffs on its exports to the U.S. In other words, Mr. Trump plans to launch a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is as preposterous an idea as it is dangerous. Let's start with the painfully obvious: A tariff is not paid by the exporter but by the importer, who passes it on to the consumer. So the money for Mr. Trump's wall will come out of the pockets of working Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump may think that the new tariffs will make Mexican products too expensive for U.S. consumers, and when they don't buy, he will have accomplished his goal of making Mexico \"pay,\" even though there will be no new revenue. But harm will also be done to American businesses, which will become less competitive without access to Mexican production. And if Mexico--which is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner--responds with new tariffs of its own, U.S. exporters will also suffer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to see how any of this could be good for Americans. According to \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Triumphant,\" areport last month  by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, annual U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico is now $1.3 trillion, nearly four times greater than before the agreement. Agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have gone up by 350%, and U.S. service exports have tripled. More than a third of U.S. merchandise exports are now bought by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would hurt American manufacturing because it would fracture the highly integrated North American economy. All three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners are competitive globally because they are able to allocate capital to its highest use anywhere on the continent. Mexico is the more labor intensive of the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, so it tends to import components, brands, technology and distribution systems from the U.S., and adds value by providing the labor necessary for assembly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has created a complex web of supply chains in a wide number of industries including aerospace, autos, electronics, machinery and precision instruments. These chains crisscross North America as firms seek to exploit comparative advantages. A September 2010 National Bureau of Economic Researchworking paper  found that 40% of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is produced by U.S. workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In the highly integrated auto sector,\" the Chamber of Commerce report notes, \"it is common for cars assembled in the Great Lakes region to cross the U.S.-Canada border half a dozen times as they are assembled.\" The result has been a more competitive U.S. auto industry, as evidenced by an 89% increase in exports between 2009 and 2014, \"topping two million cars and trucks for the first time in 2014.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. companies using Canadian and Mexican inputs and labor also benefit from the relative weakness of the peso and the Canadian dollar. The total cost of a U.S. export that contains value added from a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partner is lower, in the short run, than it would be if it were made completely in the U.S. Eventually prices adjust, but in the meantime manufacturing in a mix of currencies mitigates the effect of the strong dollar on U.S. exports. The continent's access to low-price, reliable energy is adding to the might of the North American powerhouse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's plan also fails from a security perspective. Mexican states that are engaged economically with their northern neighbors are growing faster than the rest of the country. They are also creating good jobs and raising living standards, necessary factors to stem the flow of Mexican migrants north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. businesses might be able to tap supply chains from Asia, albeit at a higher cost.

When Mr. Trump visited the Journal in November, he couldn't name a single <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal he supported, including the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He says he's a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r but that recent Administrations have been staffed by pathetic losers, so as President he would make deals more favorable to the U.S., and foreigners would bow before his threats. \"I don't mind <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars,\" he said at Thursday's debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He should be careful what he wishes. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> brinksmanship is always hazardous, especially when the world economy is so weak. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> crash could trigger a new recession that would take years to repair, and these conflicts are unpredictable and can escalate into far greater damage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tragic historic precedent is the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, signed reluctantly by Herbert Hoover. In that era the GOP was the party of tariffs, which economist Joseph Schumpeter called the Republican \"household remedy.\" Smoot-Hawley was intended to protect U.S. jobs and farmers from foreign competition, but it enraged U.S. trading partners like Canada, Britain and France.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic historian Charles Kindleberger shows in his classic, \"The World in Depression, 1929-1939,\" the U.S. tariff cascaded into a global war of beggar-thy-neighbor tariff reprisals and currency devaluation to gain a trading advantage. Each country's search for a protectionist advantage became a disaster for all as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> volumes shrank and deepened the Great Depression.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kindleberger blames the Depression in large part on a failure of leadership, especially by a U.S. that was unwilling to defend open markets in a period of distress. \"For the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a stabilizer -- one stabilizer,\" he wrote. Britain had played that role for two centuries but was then too weak. The U.S. failed to pick up the mantle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From those economic ruins, FDR's Secretary of State Cordell Hull slowly rebuilt the world trading system in the 1930s, leading to the postwar Bretton Woods accords and the Global Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. A consensus emerged in both U.S. political parties that preserving a liberal trading order was in America's national interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But maintaining this American leadership abroad for eight decades has required presidential leadership at home. The Constitution assigns express authority over foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to Congress, but since Smoot-Hawley the legislature has delegated those powers to the executive, knowing its own weakness for populist temptations. Presidents of both parties have, with periodic deviations such as George W. Bush's steel tariffs, fulfilled that obligation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But since 2009 this presidential leadership has been diffident. As a candidate Barack Obama promised to reopen <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and early in his first term he slapped a 35% tariff on Chinese tires and endorsed the \"Buy American\" provisions of the stimulus. Once the President recovered his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bearings, Mitt Romney promised in 2012 to sanction China for currency manipulation and even ran TV ads claiming that \"for the first time, China is beating us.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is now escalating this line into the centerpiece of his economic agenda -- protectionism you can believe in. And what markets and the public should understand is that as President he would have enormous unilateral power to follow through. Congress has handed the President more power over the years to impose punitive tariffs, in large part so Members can blame someone else when anti<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> populism runs hot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tools include so-called Super 301, which allows the U.S. to impose tariffs on countries that supposedly engage in unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices. Section 201 lets a President impose tariffs or limit imports on a finding by the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission of injury to a U.S. industry. Section 232 lets a President declare that certain imports pose a national security threat. The Treasury can trigger punitive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> actions by declaring a country to be a \"currency manipulator.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an exchange with Bill O'Reilly on Feb. 10, Mr. Trump said that's exactly what he plans to do. The Fox News host suggested a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war is \"going to be bloody.\" Mr. Trump replied that Americans needn't worry because the Chinese \"will crash their economy,\" adding that \"they will have a depression, the likes of which you have never seen\" in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war. He might be right about China, but the U.S. wouldn't be spared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump candidacy thus introduces a new and dangerous element of economic risk to a world still struggling to emerge from the 2008 panic and the failed progressive policy response. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would compound the potential to make depressions great again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Mr. Trump Misunderstands <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-Deficit Economics\" -- WSJ March 16, 2016)</p>\n"}

Pulling out of Nafta would hurt the exporting states that elected him.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. economy is starting to grow at a faster pace, and deregulation and tax reform are pointing to an investment boost in 2018. But the big economic policy question now is whether President Trump is going to dampen this new growth enthusiasm by imposing tariffs and kicking off a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That issue was in high relief Monday in Nashville, where Mr. Trump delivered a speech touting his policies for the rural U.S. economy that benefits from free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Mr. Trump can rightly point to White House progress on reducing government barriers to growth in American agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the waters of the U.S. rule, which extended federal jurisdiction to prairie potholes, dry creeks and muddy farm fields. Most farms are organized as pass-through businesses that can benefit from 100% expensing and the 20% deduction on taxable income. Doubling the death-tax exemption to $11 million will help more family farms avoid the need to sell when an owner dies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But farmers are scared stiff that Mr. Trump might take a protectionist turn that would impose more government barriers. Highly efficient and productive, U.S. farmers thrive in a competitive global market. But tariffs are border taxes that raise costs for U.S. producers and consumers. Managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> via quotas also shelters producers from competition and raises costs for consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump already walloped U.S. farm exporters when he dropped out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has given Europe, Australia and Canada an edge to meet growing Asian demand for high-value farm products. After Japan imposed 50% \"safeguard\" tariffs on frozen beef last July, U.S. imports dropped by a quarter. Imports from Australia, which has a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Japan and supplies about half of its frozen beef, increased by 30%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foreign leaders are working fast to lock in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that are leaving the U.S. behind. In December the European Union finalized a \"cars-for-cheese\" pact with Japan that will slash tariffs on most dairy, meat and wine to zero from up to 30%. Canada last year reached an agreement with the EU that will make 99% of their exports duty-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is also contemplating tariffs against China for stealing U.S. intellectual property. This should be addressed, but the danger is that U.S. agriculture is sure to be a top target for reprisal if the President gets into a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with Beijing. China is one of America's top farm markets, with agricultural exports tripling over the past decade to $21.4 billion, including $14.2 billion in soybeans. Australia and Brazil can replace many U.S. exports in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> spat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The greatest danger to the Farm Belt is that Mr. Trump might withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. The U.S. sends about $18 billion a year in farm products to Mexico and $23 billion to Canada, which together account for a third of American farm exports. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came into force in 1994, farm exports to Mexico and Canada have more than quadrupled. Soybean exports to Mexico have quintupled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the U.S. nixes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the three economies would return to most-favored-nation trading status and tariffs would revert to World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization levels. This would harm the U.S. the most since Canada and Mexico have higher tariffs under WTO rules than the U.S. does. Mexico imposes a 10% tariff on pork, 25% on beef and 75% on potatoes. Those rates are zero under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Responding to Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> threats, Mexico is already seeking alternative commodity suppliers. Last year Mexico reached deals to increase imports of wheat from Argentina and corn from Brazil as a hedge against U.S. withdrawal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump devoted only a couple of lines to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in his Nashville speech, and we hope it reflects what Mr. Trump has learned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the job. More likely, it means Mr. Trump still hasn't resolved the debate among his economic advisers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One argument Mr. Trump should hear is that a U.S. withdrawal from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would most hurt states like Iowa and Wisconsin that gave him his election victory. That's especially true if the U.S. imposes additional protectionist measures--such as steel tariffs--that invite retaliation. After the U.S. blocked Mexican trucks from delivering goods across the border in 2009, Mexico slapped tariffs on U.S. table grapes, potatoes, juices, almonds and wines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trashing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be among the great self-inflicted wounds in history. It would also tell other countries that the U.S. can't be trusted to keep its word on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which would make it impossible to cut the bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals the President says he wants.

The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement and continuing high levels of immigration from Mexico can derail his vision of a high-investment, high-wage, high-tech America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was elected because cheap-labor economics failed to improve life for most Americans. Under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, real wages, in constant dollars, stagnated or sank for most workers, benefits were slashed and job security declined. For most of the 1980's, the minimum wage was held constant despite inflation, creating a disguised pay cut for the poorest workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The expatriation of U.S. industry replaced many high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage service jobs. The results were predictable: higher profits for corporations and investors, and a decline in real pre-tax income for all but the wealthiest Americans. Levels of private-sector investment in productivity-enhancing new capital equipment fell far below Japanese and German rates -- and below U.S. rates of the past 30 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of those who voted for Bill Clinton and Ross Perot repudiated this cheap-labor policy. Its ghost lives on, however, as the spirit of the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>nomics is Reaganomics with a Mexican accent. Though proponents argue otherwise, it is almost certain that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, if ratified, will tend to depress U.S. wage, benefit and consumer-safety levels toward those of Mexico. Many well-paid U.S. breadwinners in the Rust Belt and Sun Belt will lose their jobs to poorly paid Mexicans in shantytowns. Nor will most displaced U.S. workers move from sunset to sunrise industries. If the 1980's are a precedent, they will go to work in low-paying service jobs at a fraction of their former salaries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is bad news for many workers, it is even worse news for the Administration. Making it easier for U.S. multinationals to relocate and take advantage of cheap Mexican labor without benefits will undermine Mr. Clinton's expensive effort to extend health care benefits to all citizens: Companies with factories in the U.S. could claim that paying more for employees' health care would make them uncompetitive with rivals that have Mexican operations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, public investment in upgrading the U.S. infrastructure will hardly persuade U.S. corporations to invest in domestic operations as long as they can make windfall profits by exploiting Mexico's labor costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not threaten Mr. Clinton's reform agenda, the continuing mass immigration of mostly unskilled Mexican workers would. Few economists deny that the flood of poorly educated Latin Americans in the last three decades has depressed wages for less-skilled U.S. workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unskilled immigrants from Mexico compete with poor blacks and whites in such cities as Los Angeles and Houston for entry-level jobs. Compared to U.S. citizens, they are also disproportionately likely to go on welfare or end up in jail, at taxpayer expense. Voters who fear that their tax dollars are going to indigent or violent immigrants are more likely to resist the tax increases without which Mr. Clinton's program cannot work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Mr. Clinton to try to raise middle-class incomes and taxes while Mexican and other third world immigrants are depressing wages and raising the costs of law enforcement, education and welfare would be like bailing water from a leaking canoe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton promised to put the material interests of workers and taxpayers above those of foreign economic rivals and the affluent few in the U.S. That means rejecting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>nomics and restricting unskilled immigration. If he does not recognize this, he may say hasta la vista not only to his domestic program but to the White House as well.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398387090.xml", "text": "<h2>How to Ruin Free Trade Before It Starts</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly before President Bush announced completion of the historic North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Rep. Richard Gephardt gave a speech proposing a cross-border \"transaction tax\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. It would supposedly offset <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s ill effects, such as environmental degradation and lost American jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That such a tax would defeat the purpose of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- the elimination of tariffs and other barriers, including the taxes that strangle commerce between nations -- has apparently not prevented Gov. Clinton from sharing Mr. Gephardt's doubts about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, or from considering his remedies. Mr. Clinton's response to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> announcement was to wonder whether there were \"other things that need to be done, either within or outside the agreement,\" to ensure labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gephardt's proposed tax is based on the experience of the European Community, which he regards as a \"case study\" for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He especially admires the EC's programs for \"transitional adjustment,\" such as the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These \"adjustment programs\" have cost European taxpayers nearly $100 billion since 1986. Even so, Mr. Gephardt feels that the U.S. needs something like them. He wants the U.S. \"to adopt a cross-border transaction tax, the revenues to be used by each country to fund the necessary programs in worker training, infrastructure development, environmental protection and in other important areas.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where would such a tax end? For that matter, where would it begin? In his speech outlining the plan, Mr. Gephardt mentioned no specific revenue requirements for these new programs, nor did he name which goods would be taxed (agricultural products? auto parts? textiles?) and at what rate. Doubtless a costly, new self-perpetuating bureaucracy -- some kind of U.S.-Mexico Border Trust and Development Fund -- would sort out the details.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Gephardt did not stop there. In the same speech he proposed a \"derivative right of action for U.S. shareholders to sue U.S. companies doing business in Mexico, or any other country.\" Thus litigation costs would be added to a burdensome new tax. So would regulatory costs. Mr. Gephardt wants to \"dramatically expand the budget for EPA's international and border operations.\" He thinks the EPA should \"treat the failure to abide by environmental laws as an unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practice.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this would depress and distort <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> just when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is poised to unleash it. If implemented properly, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will create the world's largest free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone -- involving 360 million people and over $6 trillion in annual output. Perhaps most important, it will allow Mexico to continue its sweeping economic reforms. A stronger Mexico is clearly good for the U.S. American exports to Mexico have almost tripled since 1987 and this year are expected to total $44 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Gephardt tax, together with its regulatory apparatus, would defy logic and place a new burden on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> just when the U.S. has succeeded in opening Mexico's markets. It would hurt Texas and California most: People in those states have already seen the gains from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and are the most eager for more. Unfortunately, this point seems to have been lost on my colleague Don Newquist, the chairman of the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission, who has written recently in favor of the Gephardt tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the tax isn't needed to protect the environment on the border. EPA's own administrator, William Reilly, has called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"the greenest international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty the world has ever seen.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, he notes, will improve Mexico's environment by providing \"sustainable development\" in the border region. And it will create more national income from which Mexico can fund clean-up programs. Besides, the U.S. retains the right to enforce existing American health, safety, and environmental standards and to deny entry to goods that do not measure up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Similarly, a Gephardt tax isn't needed to re-train American workers. President Bush has doubled the fund for the Economic and Dislocated Worker Adjustment Assistance Program. Total funding for worker adjustment is approaching $923 million. Thus, the workers who lose their jobs because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be given new opportunities. New taxes aren't needed to help them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be implemented gradually, over the course of 15 years. Both workers and their industries will have time to adjust to the increased competition that results from it. A Gephardt tax, on the other hand, would stunt the very <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> growth and job creation the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement was designed to promote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best response to the demands of economic transition would be simply to give <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a chance to work. Surely, the worst response would be an undefined new government program costing billions of dollars, funded by a new tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Watson is vice chairman of the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission.</p>\n"}

For two candidates who pledge to repair U.S. standing in the world, it was an odd swipe at our next-door neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mexican and Canadian officials recoiled at the prospect of overturning settled political and economic expectations in their countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could the Democrats mean? Labor and the environment are covered by \"side agreements\" to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, negotiated by President Bill Clinton, that call on all three countries to make and enforce good laws. The more recent U.S.-Peru <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Agreement went further, requiring Peru to change its labor laws to meet International Labor Organization standards. Both Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton, who supported the Peru deal, see it as a model for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation with Mexico, according to their advisers. But if that's all the candidates have in mind, they are wildly overpromising: The Peru pact's labor and environmental standards are only incrementally stronger than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreements. Meanwhile, the risks of renegotiation are huge. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is controversial in Mexico, too; farmers there are outraged by American agricultural imports. If the Mexican side asked that tariffs be reimposed on U.S. grain as part of a renegotiation, would President Obama or President Clinton sacrifice American farmers whose votes they were seeking only yesterday in Iowa? Or would he or she pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? If the latter, the tariffs on both sides would revert to the levels of 14 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whole U.S. industries have grown up to take advantage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Meanwhile, none of the U.S. jobs that left for Mexico would come back; they'd simply go to China, India or elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic candidates understand that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the developing world has both costs and benefits, which are not evenly distributed across the United States. Two days before this week's debate, Mr. Obama said, \"I don't think it's realistic for us to repeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" because that \"would actually result in more job loss . . . than job gains.\" Ms. Clinton awkwardly pleaded that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has benefited some parts of the country  --  such as Texas. Yet the urge to win Ohio trumped, and both Democrats made a threat that, if taken seriously, can be described only as reckless.  In other words, we have to hope that they were only pandering.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409109561.xml", "text": "<h2>Bush's Latin America Trade Mirage</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With a Western Hemisphere summit approaching this week and the U.S. economy sluggish, President Bush is touting a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement of the Americas as essential to reviving American growth. A close look at U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Latin America and at the region's economic prospects shows how badly misplaced his hopes are.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush claims that a hemispheric <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal would open major new markets for American workers and companies and help offset the slowdown in domestic business. Yet Latin America's capacity to stimulate U.S. growth, never strong, has been steadily weakening. During the 1990s, despite major economic reforms, the region's annual growth rates averaged only 3.2 percent.  Between 1995 and 1999, the U.S. share of hemispheric economic output actually increased -- from 73 percent to 76 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Add in America's partners in the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- Mexico and Canada -- and the percentage of the hemisphere's market already covered by U.S. free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals is even higher. Although many U.S. companies would undoubtedly sell more to a freer-trading Latin America, from the standpoint of the entire U.S. economy the region has become ever smaller change in recent years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is much growth in Latin markets likely for the foreseeable future. Most of South America is mired in foreign debt, and major countries such as Argentina and Brazil have accepted International Monetary Fund rescue packages that require them to cut back consumption at home -- and therefore cut back imports. On top of this indebtedness, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador will be lucky to prevent continued economic contraction in the next few years, much less generate growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Casting further doubt on hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as an engine of U.S. prosperity is the use of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as its model. Contrary to its supporters' depictions, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> never sought to help U.S. companies and workers by opening an allegedly huge Mexican consumer market to U.S. exports. Instead, the aim was to help U.S. multinational companies lower their manufacturing costs and regain competitiveness worldwide by encouraging them to move their labor-intensive operations to Mexico, with its rock-bottom wages and lax environmental and worker safety regulations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift of production would obviously help Mexico's economy and workers. But because these companies' products would continue to be made partly in America, the idea went, U.S. workers would eventually benefit, too, as these goods regained market share at home and abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> never worked this way for American workers. First, because the U.S. market was kept indiscriminately open to all comers, U.S.-brand products made partly in Mexico almost never replaced American imports from Europe and Asia. They simply added to an existing import flood and pushed U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits to record levels. Second, U.S. companies never displayed much prowess at exporting goods made partly or wholly in Mexico anywhere outside the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, American firms saw no reason to limit their Mexico operations to low-wage, low-tech work. Mexican workers have generally proven to be just as good as their U.S. counterparts in advanced manufacturing, and even research and development, engineering and design -- at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s rules were never written tightly enough to prevent European and Asian manufacturers from using Mexico as a transshipment point into the U.S. market for goods they made overwhelmingly outside North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s focus on cutting business costs, and because Mexico's work force has grown so rapidly, Mexican workers have not benefited either. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, since 1994 the gap between U.S. and Mexican manufacturing wages has grown by some 30 percent -- and not because U.S. wages have soared. Instead, American manufacturing workers have seen sluggish wage growth at best, and inflation-adjusted pay in Mexico has fallen by some 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's unique location and head start will prevent most other Latin American countries from also becoming all-purpose export platforms to the United States. But the ease with which U.S. firms sell goods made in far-off Asia to the United States indicates that many Latin countries have the potential for being used in this way. And even if export-oriented U.S. factories didn't proliferate in Argentina or Brazil, businesses' expanded options under the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement of the Americas to move U.S.-oriented factories throughout the hemisphere would help them keep labor costs low and regulations weak in countries where they currently operate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement of the kind Bush wants would simply perpetuate a strategy that encourages the net export of high- paying U.S. jobs while assuming that a lower and lower-wage U.S. work force can keep importing and consuming at record levels. The magnitude of the current slowdown indicates that this strategy is unsustainable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the president really wants to boost U.S. growth rates and incomes, he should focus on opening markets in Europe and Japan. They might be growing slowly, but their economies are already huge, and their consumers actually have money to spend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council Educational Foundation.</p>\n"}

But before free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents in Congress sign on to this epic of legalese, they should actually try to read it. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> unfortunately demonstrates, one cannot judge a book by its cover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its hopeful title, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parallels the Clinton budget package, immediately raising <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and erecting a vast supra-national <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bureaucracy on Jan. 1, 1994, while promising tariff phaseouts that don't fully materialize until the year 2009. Meanwhile, the tariff reductions themselves may be repealed by procedures contained in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s little-known Chapter 8. Called \"snap-back\" provisions, the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariffs may be applied against Mexican (or Canadian) imports that \"cause or threaten serious injury to a domestic industry.\" The Clinton administration's recent side agreements allow for the expansion of both import tariffs and quotas under Chapter 8, enabling each country to enact protectionist policies for particular industries for the purpose of, for instance, arresting declining unemployment in uncompetitive industries. This is free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upon ratification, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will impose strict \"rules of origin\" requiring certain products to be manufactured wholly or partially in North America if they are to escape punitive tariffs or quotas. These significant <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers will cover a wide range of products including automobiles, light trucks, textiles, computer circuitry, peanut butter, orange juice and dairy products. Attaching so-called rules of origin to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a thinly veiled attempt to shield particular domestic producers from foreign competition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides overt nontariff <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, the Clinton administration's side agreements create expansive bureaucracies. Established to enforce labor and environmental regulations, these bodies include Ministerial Councils, International Coordinating Secretariats, National Administrative Offices, Joint Advisory Committees, Evaluation Committees of Experts, and Dispute Settlement Panels. This alphabet soup of tri-national bureaucracies is granted unprecedented power to conduct investigations, issue comprehensive reports, and facilitate cooperation between national governments for the purpose of harmonizing worker safety and environmental regulations. Unlike free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s international red tape could easily entangle businesses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A wide range of issues would fall under the purview of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> commissions. The labor commission would have a broad mandate covering such issues as occupational health and safety, benefits for workers, and industrial relations. The commission on environmental cooperation would be able to consider \"environmental implications of products throughout their lifecycles.\" According to the office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, \"any environmental or natural resource issue may be addressed\" by the commissions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> invents a new justification for bureaucratic intrusions into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. While most international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law allows government review of \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-related\" environmental disputes, which requires some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> injury to be shown for the government to intervene, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> environmental commission is authorized to adjudicate over any matters that are remotely \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-connected.\" This new definition expands governmental authority so that any environmental issue with any conceivable impact on cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or investment is subject to review.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> commission may compel more stringent enforcement of any nation's environmental laws, not just those impacting on cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Mickey Kantor himself describes these labor and environmental provisions as \"new and unique, also stunning in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s expansion of extraterritorial bureaucracy is bought with the price of national sovereignty. As part of the dispute resolution process, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Dispute Settlement Panel may assign \"action plans\" to national governments compelling them to more strictly enforce environmental or labor regulations. The panel would be given jurisdiction over all subnational governments from the Yukon to the Yucatan, including our own state and local governments. If an action plan is not carried out, the panel may impose fines on the offending country of as much as $20 million per offense. The panel also has the power to authorize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions against a country, resulting in not only tariffs but a complete revocation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment benefits. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> subjects the U.S. and Mexico to the same <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions that Canada utterly rejected as an infringement on its autonomy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s complex administrative process would also grant extraordinary power and influence to nongovernmental organizations. The aforementioned Joint Advisory Committee, along with the Evaluation Committees of Experts, would comprise representatives from environmentalist groups and labor-supported organizations, respectively. Their role with the commissions would be to provide \"expert\" advice on regulatory matters, and they would enjoy an unprecedented degree of access to commission proceedings. Nongovernmental organizations would be able to use this privileged position to clamor for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> restrictions, acting as an inside lobby on behalf of domestic industries seeking protection from their competitors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would also impede one of the most important functions of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which is to foster competition among governments for creating more favorable economic conditions. Nations like Mexico, Argentina and Chile have been liberalizing their economies by deregulating overburdened sectors of the economy. Various provisions in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, however, expressly forbid such deregulation. Article 1114, for example, prohibits the relaxation of environmental regulations in order to attract foreign investment. In fact, Article 756 commits the signatories to \"upward harmonization\" of regulations. These provisions will now be vigorously enforced by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s supra-national entities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> should be simple. It should not require endless lobbying, litigation and negotiating. Any country that wants free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must merely abolish its own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, as Mexico has already been doing for several years now. Hopelessly complex <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that restrict free exchange are not repaired by the presence of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rhetoric. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s proponents are inspired more by what they hope it could be than by what it really is.    ---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sheehan is a research associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>\n"}

This is the first <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement specifically to protect workers' rights and the environment.

With <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> we gain much: new jobs; higher environmental and labor standards and a tougher enforcement of them; border cleanup; the elimination of high tariff and nontariff barriers, and thus of the incentives that led many companies to move to Mexico; and greater Mexican prosperity and stability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is rejected, all that is lost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now the hard work begins.

{"id": "1771660215.xml", "text": "<h2>Peddling fiction on free trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"SECRETARY CLINTON supported virtually every one of the disastrous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements written by corporate America,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) railed on Sunday night. As the presidential campaign moves to the Rust Belt, the socialist contender is doubling down on protectionism. His stance is built on bogus numbers that defy the overwhelming consensus among economists, and his solutions would do much more harm than good. But politically, it appears to be working.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Sanders won the Michigan Democratic primary on Tuesday, exit polls indicated that his anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda helped him. Fifty-seven percent of those who voted agreed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \"takes away U.S. jobs,\" and 56 percent of them picked Mr. Sanders. Those figures augur poorly for Hillary Clinton's prospects in the Midwest - and for the political durability of the country's commitment to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's unfortunate, as Mr. Sanders's populist rhetoric doesn't stand up to scrutiny. His insistence, for example, that the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement led to 800,000 job losses ignores analyses from unbiased sources such as the Congressional Research Service. \"In reality, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics,\" a 2015 CRS analysis found.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blaming freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for the loss of manufacturing jobs fails to tell the much bigger story of economic transformation that has swept the world over the past several decades. Technological change, automation, productivity improvements and other factors have eliminated old-school manufacturing jobs all over the world. Mr. Sanders cannot bring back the U.S. economy of the 1960s, and it would be harmful to try.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sanders's story also neglects to mention the broad benefits that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> brings. It pulls foreign trading partners out of poverty. It helps U.S. exporters, who account for an increasingly large share of American output. It enriches U.S. consumers, who get cheaper goods and greater selection. Economists resoundingly agree that these sorts of diffuse benefits outweigh the costs over time. Moreover, there are non-economic benefits, as well. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> helped turn Mexico from an antagonist into a regional partner. The much-maligned Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) would knit the United States into the Asia-Pacific region for decades to come.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The downside is that freeing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> clearly exacts some costs in particular sectors, and those affected can be politically mobilized. The solution, though, is not to provoke international enmity and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict by adopting a hostile attitude toward would-be trading partners. The smart policy is embracing openness and pocketing the overall gains in wealth and prosperity, while maintaining a safety net to help those who lose out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, Ms. Clinton has failed to make these arguments, though they were a gospel of Bill Clinton's presidency. Instead, she has surrendered the issue by failing to stand up for the TPP. Mr. Sanders already has the protectionists' vote; Ms. Clinton would be wise to offer a positive alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Whatever policy recommendation he makes \u2014 family separations at the border, tax cuts for the super-rich, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) \u2014 I can be virtually certain that he is wrong. Use him as a guide to make an about-face. Implore a foreign leader to exclude members of Congress from their countries? Wrong. Insist that they be let in. Pull out of the Paris accords?

Under Trump, Americans have learned to love the Affordable Care Act (which Trump sought to destroy), have taken the side of \"dreamers\" (whom Trump holds hostage) and have finally figured out that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a good thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll finds: \"Amid President Donald Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with China, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they support free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with foreign countries. ... That represents a new high in the NBC/WSJ survey on this question, and it's a 7-point increase from the last time it was asked in 2017.\" Only 27 percent think free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is bad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That should serve as a warning to lawmakers of both parties and Democratic presidential candidates. It's good policy and good politics to support opening markets for our farmers and businesses and giving our consumers access to the best goods at the lowest prices. In fact, \"The percentage of those favoring free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is up 13 points from 2015 and 7 points from 2017, with Democrats and independents much more supportive than they were four years ago.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democratic politicians who say TPP was a bad idea (although it would have put China in a box and greatly improved our negotiating position on items such as intellectual property, not to mention boosting our strategic alliances in the region) sound very 2015. When they reflexively reject <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 and bad-mouth the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with a a vague and unsupported claim that it costs jobs, they sound like Trump. In other words, they sound economically illiterate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, it's perfectly fine to insist that we give generous support to workers who have been displaced by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. (Getting them ready for the real threat, automation, would be a good idea.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must also aggressively enforce international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules that prohibit dumping and phony invocation of national security protections (just as Trump is doing). But the notion that we have more leverage to negotiate environmental protections when we renege on agreements or wage tariff wars is Trump-level dumb.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements must include certain core labor protections. And we have done so, as the Atlantic has noted:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to complaints about the lack of labor rights in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, Congress came up in 2007 with the May 10th agreement, a bipartisan compromise aimed at ensuring that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners were actually working to improve labor conditions. It required that member countries adopt and enforce the basic labor standards set in the 1988 Declaration of the International Labor Organization. It also made labor disputes subject to the same settlement procedures as commercial <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes, meaning that countries that violated labor rules could be subject to sanctions. May 10th required the U.S. to hold countries more accountable for labor standards\u2014Congress did not vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements negotiated with Peru, Colombia, and Panama until those countries had changed their labor laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is plenty of room to argue for greater specificity in the agreements and better enforcement mechanisms. But arguing that workers around the globe are better off without such protections is daft. As Vox reported, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 \"includes several labor rules meant to benefit workers on both sides of the border. For example, Mexico has agreed to pass a law giving workers the right to real union representation, and to adopt other labor laws that meet international standards set forth by the United Nations. American auto companies that assemble their cars in Mexico would also need to use more US-made car parts to avoid tariffs, which would help US factory workers. And about 40 percent of those cars would need to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.\" The problem arises in getting Mexico to enforce these rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Democrats want to sound really smart, they would start saying things like \"I'm for TPP and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 so that we can sell American goods and services. But we must nail down the worker protections, maybe agree to spot-audits or other mechanisms so that poverty-wage workers aren't undercutting our own workers. And <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adjustment benefits have to be a whole lot more generous and effective.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, Democrats need to stop pandering on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and sounding Trumpian. Tout the benefits of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, give a few concrete examples as to how to improve worker and environmental protections and bash Trump for not seizing opportunities to put China back on its heels (e.g. enter TPP, which excluded China). Alternatively, they can sound like Trump and inveigh against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals based on the irrelevant criteria of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits. They would be in a much better position to skewer Trump on his recession-inducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> antics if their own position on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rested on firmer economic ground.</p>\n"}

He promised union leaders to force a renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on his terms. Back then, I thought Obama went too far.

Regional integration is a rare effective response to faltering globalization, dangerously volatile petroleum markets, and U.S. economic and military overextension.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, yes, Mr. President, renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But move its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization successes forward into a broad regional pact that more tightly links North America's energy resources, currencies, security policies, and other economic and political assets. Do not move the three nations backward  --  toward protectionism  --  as you originally proposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I visited Canada this month to explore this theme after hearing much about the growing importance of regional integration from officials in Russia and in Western Europe. I had heard Prime Minister Vladimir Putin express hope that Russia's ruble would soon become one of five or six regional reserve currencies that would in effect replace the U.S. dollar as the primary international means of exchange.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putin also praised a German government decision in September to push General Motors to accept a Russian-backed bid for its Opel subsidiary. This was a \"strategic\" move toward establishing an eastward-looking regional marketplace, Putin suggested in remarks to the Valdai Discussion Club.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>French and British government ministers told me in their capitals that only a rejuvenated European Union can prevent the United States and China from forming a G-2 to dominate international economic policymaking. And the new Japanese government is pushing the notion of an East Asian community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North America lags behind conceptually in addressing regionalization as the next important global economic cycle, even as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has led to major changes on the ground. No surprise: Both Canada and Mexico routinely emphasize their differences with and independence from the behemoth on their borders, and U.S. citizens have been proud of their God-given right to be indifferent to their immediate neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that is changing, for good reasons and some not-so-good ones, as I learned at the annual North American Forum meeting here. This group of Canadian, American and Mexican entrepreneurs, politicians and academic experts has been working quietly for five years to identify and advance regional understanding, with former secretary of state George P.

And Canadian officials who once expressed fears of diluting their special links to the United States by bringing Mexico into security and economic discussions now welcome the triangular dialogue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What accounts for this psychological change, which has affected U.S. delegates as well? \"Events\" is as good an answer as any. Certainly, the shooting drug war in Mexico that is fueled by U.S. cash and guns, the threat of international terrorism, and U.S. addiction to foreign borrowing and foreign oil, which is reintroducing transportation costs as a significant factor in international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, have drawn bright lines under the need to look closer to home for answers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After 20 years, globalization's push-and-pull of goods, capital, technology, people and ideas across borders has been forced to pause, and it is far from certain it will ever again resume that frantic, far-flung march.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If Mexico has swine flu, we know the U.S. and Canada are also going to be exposed to it,\" said one Canadian official. \"If the U.S. is in the sights of terrorists, Canada is in the sights of terrorists.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such generalized sentiments were supported by reams of statistics about Canada's significant shale oil deposits; about commercial traffic across the Ambassador Bridge (linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario) equaling all U.S. exports to Japan; about the 400 million crossings, 1 million arrests and 500 deaths that occur annually on the Mexican-U.S. border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was eye- and ear-opening to this foreign reporter who has spent more time in, and studying about, Guinea-Bissau or the Czech Republic than Canada or Mexico.

The U.S. election demonstrated the growing demographic bonds that connect our countries' futures. The election in Mexico heralded a new era of change and reform, as much as a new style of governing, based on pragmatism and results.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To build a more prosperous future for our two countries, we must continue strengthening and expanding our deep economic, social and cultural ties. It is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns. Our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short-sighted way. When I meet with President Obama on Tuesday -- just days before my inauguration -- I want to discuss the best way to rearrange our common priorities. After all, our agenda affects millions of citizens in both countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most important issue is finding new ways to bolster our economic and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship to attain common prosperity in our nations. The United States is already Mexico's largest trading partner. As a result of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), our economic ties have grown to an unprecedented degree. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> links 441 million people producing trillions of dollars in goods and services annually, making it the largest trading bloc in the world. Consequently, in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> we have a solid foundation to further integrate our economies through greater investments in finance, infrastructure, manufacturing and energy. Together, we must build a more competitive and productive region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another relevant bilateral issue relates to Mexico's status as an increasingly desirable and dependable manufacturing location. My country is the second-largest supplier of electronic goods to the United States. Coca-Cola, DuPont, GM, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Audi and many others are seizing the opportunity to manufacture within our borders. We seek to continue offering U.S. consumers better products and better prices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Energy production is another emerging area that can enhance our nations' potential. I plan to open Mexico's energy sector to national and foreign private investment. Mexico holds the fifth-largest shale gas reserve in the world, in addition to large deep-water oil reserves and a tremendous potential in renewable energy. We will not surrender Mexico's ownership over its energy resources, and we will not privatize our state-run oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). We will, however, welcome new technologies, new partnerships and new investments. Together with the United States and Canada, this may well contribute to guaranteeing North American energy independence -- something from which we would all greatly benefit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Above all, our mutual interest lies in our intertwined peoples. More than 1 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico, and my country remains the largest source of immigrants to the United States. Some analysts detect new momentum for comprehensive immigration reform since the U.S. presidential election. All Mexicans would welcome such a development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both of our nations are seriously affected by organized-crime activities and drug trafficking. Working against them must be a shared responsibility. I will continue the efforts begun by President Felipe Calderon, but the strategy must necessarily change. I set as a public goal slashing violent crime significantly, proposing a sizable increase in security spending and doing away with redundant police levels. I will improve coordination among crime-fighting authorities, expand the federal police by at least 35,000 officers and bolster intelligence-gathering and analysis. It is also important that our countries increase intelligence-sharing and crime-fighting techniques and promote cooperation among law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am visiting Washington and President Obama because our nations share a long-standing and important relationship. The 2012 elections mark the beginning of a new era for the United States and Mexico. This is a great time to join efforts and capitalize on that momentum. We must build a more prosperous North America, on the basis of an alliance for a further competitive and productive integration of our economies.</p>\n"}

Therefore there must be a thousand and one other reasons -- the exchange rate, the buildup of capital-intensive industries, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in intermediate products -- why U.S. merchandise exports to Mexico soared to more than $40 billion, the third largest export market after Canada and Japan in 1992.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Even though we know that there has been a $10 billion turnaround in the U.S.-Mexico merchandise <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance since 1986, converting a $5 billion U.S. deficit into a $5 billion U.S. bilateral surplus last year, we cannot afford all the imports from Mexico that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will stimulate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Despite the evidence that U.S. exports are highest to countries in which U.S. direct investment is greatest, such as Canada among developed countries and Mexico among developing ones, U.S. investment in Mexico will suck jobs out of the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- While we know that the U.S. government has no effective way to prevent companies from investing wherever they wish based on their perceived economic interest, we don't want them to go to Mexico. This is so despite the fact that we also know that when Mexico exports to the U.S., about 80% of the earnings result in imports back from the U.S. compared with about 20% for Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- While it has become quite evident that international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is increasing rapidly in intermediate as opposed to final products, we should not count intermediate product exports to Mexico as \"real\" exports because Mexico might add value to these and ship the products back to the U.S. This form of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accounting, of excluding intermediate product exports, need not be used for U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with other countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Even though the factor content -- the mix of labor and capital in producing goods -- is about the same for U.S. merchandise exports to Mexico and Mexican merchandise exports to the U.S., Mexico is useful only as a low-wage haven for U.S. production.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Nevertheless, there is great danger to our future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico because industries there are importing large amounts of capital goods and will therefore become more capital-intensive and use less low-cost labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- If Mexican industry becomes more capital-intensive and real Mexican wages rise, this poses a threat to U.S. exports, because Mexicans will be able to buy more from the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Even though we know that product costs depend on total productivity and not just wages, and despite all the evidence about far higher U.S. productivity both at the plant level and because of better U.S. transportation and communications, the U.S. must focus on wage levels and not the unit cost of products. We must treat the low-wage countries, the Bangladeshes of the world, as our most important <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adversaries, and not Japan, Germany and other high-wage countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- The economic disparity between the U.S. and Mexico makes it most unwise to enter into free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

Let's prevent investments in Mexico by U.S. companies even as we know these are the basis for stimulating U.S. exports.

{"id": "410206971.xml", "text": "<h2>5; Myths About the Treaty the Democrats Want to Trade In</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton often likes to take credit for her husband's achievements as president. But then there's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Clinton may have been present at the creation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement in 1994, but she wants everybody to know that it's not her baby.  She now proposes to \"fix\" the agreement to make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \"work for working families.\" Sen. Barack Obama, meanwhile, makes the fallout from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> sound downright nuclear, lamenting that \"entire cities  . . . have been devastated as a consequence of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\" Despite the heightened rhetoric, he, too, wishes to \"fix\" the treaty, not nix it. Only the presumptive Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain, would leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> untouched; his priority is freeing up global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic rivals have bought into most of the myths that have been peddled about the agreement and have placed their opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> at the center of their campaigns. Here's some information that could help them update their stump speeches.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has transformed the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hardly. Critics rightly point out that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s economic benefits were oversold, but they're wrong to heap the blame for all America's woes on it. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which expanded the existing Canadian-U.S. free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area to Mexico, has had only a marginal  effect on the U.S. economy. Yes, exports to Mexico have more than tripled since 1993  --  but at $161 billion last year, they still account for only 1.1 percent of the economy. Considering that total U.S. exports have more than doubled over the same period, to more than $1.6 trillion a year, the boost from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is just a trifle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though imports from Mexico have risen nearly five-fold since 1993  --  potentially threatening some U.S. businesses  --  they only amounted to $230 billion in 2007, or less than 1.7 percent of the $14 trillion U.S. economy. That's peanuts. And for all the fears of factories being shipped south on the back of an  18-wheeler, the total U.S. investment in Mexican factories and offices adds up to a mere $75 billion. Mexico received just $19 billion in foreign direct investment in 2006, while the United States attracted $175 billion. Thus, the \"giant sucking sound\" that Texas businessman and independent presidential candidate H. Ross Perot heard back in the 1990s doesn't sound so giant after all. But the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> don't seem so remarkable, either.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has put countless Americans out of work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not really. Obama claims that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has destroyed a million American jobs. Suppose he's right. Total employment still rose by 27 million jobs between 1993 and 2007, to 137.6 million, and the unemployment rate has fallen. At worst, then, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has cost only a tiny minority of American workers their jobs. And even that is a one-sided view. As Mexico opened its economy to U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> created new American jobs, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> critics also decry the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, but at $70 billion a year, it accounts for only 0.5 percent of the U.S. economy. These figures should quiet <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> foes, who point to lost jobs and stagnant manufacturing wages, as well as boosters, who trumpet claims of rising output and record-high exports. The fact is, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has had only a fractional impact on these trends. Mexico's biggest impact on the U.S. labor market is not through <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but through immigration. And the money that Mexican migrants send home contributes more to the Mexican economy than foreign direct investment does.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3\"Fixing\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be easy and cost-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not so. Any changes would require a lengthy and complex renegotiation with Canada and Mexico. As Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, has pointed out, \"Of course, if any American government ever chose to make the mistake of opening [<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>], we would have some things we would want to talk about as well.\" Just the threat of pulling out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would do some damage, too. Far from boosting America's international reputation  --  something all presidential candidates agree is important  --  it would fan fears that the United States is an unreliable ally and discourage foreign governments from committing to future agreements with Washington. The slim chance of concluding the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization's Doha round of global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks would vanish. And if the next president wants, for instance, Mexico's help in dealing with immigration reform and Canada's hand in combating terrorism, then blaming America's friendly neighbors for its perceived woes is hardly the way to start.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4Making <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s labor and environmental regulations stricter would benefit U.S. workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Probably not. Clinton wants to make the treaty's labor and environmental provisions \"far tougher and absolutely binding\" and to require that all future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements include similar language. The stated purpose is to raise labor and environmental standards around the world and to make it harder for companies to ship jobs to countries where workers have fewer protections than in the United States. But America's trading partners would probably see the move as covert protectionism  --  since when have the Teamsters cared about Mexican wildlife?  --  and may retaliate. Meanwhile, consumers would probably resent the increased cost of their imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In any case, tough social clauses could backfire on the United States. Canada's labor and environmental standards are generally higher than the United States', and Canadians could claim that lax American standards amount to unfair competition. Given that Canada and Mexico have joined global efforts to curb climate change, they might wish to restrict American imports if the United States continues to hold back. And Mexican workers arguably have stronger labor rights than Americans: Unlike the United States, Mexico has ratified most of the International Labor Organization's conventions on core labor standards, including those on freedom of association, collective bargaining and employment discrimination. If the United States bashes Mexican labor practices, what's to stop Mexico from objecting to American imports produced in non-unionized factories?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5Renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should be a priority for the new president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Absolutely not. With the housing market plunging, the financial system seizing up and the economy apparently shrinking, tinkering with a treaty that governs <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with two of Washington's trading partners is a costly distraction  --  whatever your view of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The next president will have much bigger things to worry about, such as stopping the economy from going into a tailspin; cushioning the blow for vulnerable Americans who lose their homes, their jobs and their health care in the downturn; and helping frame new regulations that protect the economy against future financial excesses without stifling the market. Compared to all that, changing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> looks like small change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>mail@philippelegrain.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Philippe Legrain is a journalism fellow with the German Marshall Fund of the United States and the author of \"Immigrants: Your Country Needs Them.\"</p>\n"}

The Victorian version of globalization -- which depended either on colonialism, or on the support of domestic elites so disconnected from the local population that they might as well have been colonists -- began to fall apart in 1911, when Mexicans rebelled against the rule of the ''scientific'' dictator Porfirio Diaz. The cocksure optimism of ''emerging market'' investors in the early 90's got its first serious warning at the end of 1994, when Mexico plunged into financial crisis -- a crisis that proved to be a dress rehearsal for the terrifying Asian crisis that began 30 months later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Mexico's triumphantly free election on Sunday was cause for rejoicing, not just for Mexico, but for everyone who hopes that this time around we may be getting globalization right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's by no means clear that Vicente Fox Quesada was the better man. In terms of policy positions, he was virtually indistinguishable from Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (what a name!), or PRI. And Mr. Fox will face a sort of reverse version of the Nixon-goes-to-China effect, which may put him at a disadvantage as he tries to continue Mexico's opening to the world. As a former executive of Coca-Cola, he will have to be especially careful not to lay himself open to charges of Coca-colonization, of selling his country to foreign investors. As the candidate of a party originally founded to defend the privileges of the Catholic Church and oppose land reform, he will have to bend over backwards to show that his free-market policies are not just a way to make the rich even richer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet his electoral victory is the best thing that could have happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The worst-case scenario was a narrow victory by the PRI -- a victory that would have raised understandable suspicions of fraud. A solid victory by Mr. Labastida might have been acceptable; but Mr. Fox's victory proves that Mexico's reformers meant what they said, that they really have been out to turn their country into a real democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Need one point out that this is, among other things, a vindication for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement? Sophisticated supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have always acknowledged that the treaty would in itself produce only modest economic gains -- a few percent added to real income in Mexico, a few tenths of a percent added in the U.S. The real justification of the agreement was political: it gave Mexico's reformers an achievement to point to, a promise of better things to come. Some critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> jeered at this argument, claiming that Mexican reform was a sham, that the reformers themselves were merely well-spoken crooks -- a claim made more plausible as revelations emerged about the dealings of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. But now we know that, whatever the sins of Mr. Salinas, the reformers he brought to power were sincere -- and the reform was real.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More broadly, those of us who believe that globalization, while neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for democracy, tends to promote freedom have another success story to add to the list -- a list that now includes Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Argentina and more. When a nation opens to the world, its businesses become less dependent on government favor, its citizens become more aware of how politics is conducted in advanced countries. The result, repeatedly, has been a peaceful transition to true democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, such transitions are not automatic -- we still need heroes. And the hero of Mexico's transition is the current president, Ernesto Zedillo. Mr. Zedillo was an accidental president, a mild-mannered economist thrust into power when assassins gunned down the PRI's chosen candidate. His elevation raised the obvious questions: Would he become just another machine politician? Or would he simply be weak, allowing the ''dinosaurs'' to return to business -- including the business of stealing elections -- as usual?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Zedillo was neither corrupted by office, nor a patsy for  the corrupt officials in which the  PRI still abounds. He insisted on a fair election. And he and his party have triumphed in defeat: the finest hour in the PRI's history was surely the moment in which it finally lost power.</p>\n"}

On Nov. 17, the House will vote on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. While these two events may seem unconnected, they are closely related. Since the fall of the wall, there has been a collapse of state-based economic systems all over the world, not just in Eastern Europe. As a result, four billion people in Eurasia, Latin America and Africa are attempting to rejoin the global marketplace after decades of living under Marxist or mercantilist economic regimes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rebirth of a global market economy encompassing five billion people will create both challenges and opportunities for the old industrial nations. There will be a surge in the potential supply of low-cost labor, agricultural output and raw materials, while the newly market-oriented economies will have an insatiable appetite for capital goods, consumer goods and services from the old industrial countries. In fact, while the newly market-oriented economies account for only about a third of world output, they have 80% of the world's people and will account for more than 95% of the growth in world labor supply during the next half century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These opportunities in the new market economies have already had a major impact on private-sector <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment. Capital flows to developing countries' stock markets have shot up to more than $20 billion this year from only $1.3 billion in 1988, while international bond financing will exceed $50 billion compared with $28.6 billion in 1990. As a result of this capital flood, the volume of privatizations in the developing countries has expanded from $2.6 billion in 1988 to $23.2 billion last year, or nearly half the world total.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The developing countries have been one of the few growth locomotives in the world economy in recent years. Since 1990, for example, U.S. export sales to Latin America have increased at a 16% annual rate, compared with only 3.5% for exports to the industrial countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While private-sector players have moved quickly and effectively to take advantage of the opportunities created by the spread of liberal economic ideas to formerly state-dominated economic systems, governments in the old industrial nations have severely mismanaged the first stage of their adjustment to the post-Cold War political order.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of promoting economic growth after 1990, the G-7 nations pursued recessionary fiscal and monetary policies by putting a misplaced emphasis on exchange-rate targets in Europe and on restraining inflation in the U.S. and Japan. As a result of the poor performance of the industrial economies, there has been an upsurge of protectionist sentiment practically everywhere. The Uruguay round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> has stalled over farm subsidies, the European Community has imposed numerous barriers on East European goods, and there is strong opposition in Congress to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> despite the boom in U.S. exports to Mexico since 1988.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s defeat in the House vote scheduled for mid-November would be a major blow to the global economic integration of all formerly state-dominated economic systems. It would undermine the credibility of the Clinton administration as it tries to complete the GATT talks with Europe and would encourage the EC to continue blocking exports from Eastern Europe and Russia. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> itself has emerged as the focal point for the fears and anxieties of U.S. workers about competition with all low-wage countries, its defeat would probably encourage congressional attempts to restrict U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with other newly market-oriented economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Americans do not associate the economic policy transformation now occurring in Mexico with the upheavals that have occurred in the former communist world since 1989, the links are very strong. The first great defining political event of the 20th century was neither World War I nor the Russian Revolution; it was the Mexican Revolution of 1910.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before the 1910 revolution, Mexico had boasted a high level of foreign investment as well as free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In 1900, Mexico and other Latin American nations had export/GDP ratios as high as 20%, compared with only 7% in 1991. After the revolution, Mexico severely restricted foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment, setting a precedent for economic nationalism that would be widely imitated elsewhere in the Third World during the second half of this century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the 1970s, Mexico's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies had produced an economic system that was highly inefficient and corrupt, providing wealth for the privileged owners of protected industries and low wages for everyone else. Mexico could not share in the prosperity that was enjoyed by the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-oriented economies of East Asia during the 1970s and 1980s because its business elites had no incentives to export and were in some cases as incompetent as the communist nomenklatura of Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1992, the U.S. had a $5 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico compared with a $75 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with East Asia, because American firms accounted for about 70% of Mexico's imports and a much smaller share of Asia's. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had been enacted 30 years ago, thousands of jobs that migrated to Asia's export-oriented industries after the 1960s would have gone to Mexico and boosted the whole North American economy by producing a surge in Mexican wages comparable to the 20-fold expansion that occurred in East Asian incomes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many \"progressive\" critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, such as the AFL-CIO, are reluctant to acknowledge the relationship between Mexican poverty and the country's tradition of protectionism. But the fact is, they became self-reinforcing in the modern era. Mexico suffered from low wages and government attempts to suppress the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions for the same reasons Eastern Europe did; the state domination of the economic system and the protected nature of the manufacturing sector encouraged the production of shoddy goods that could not withstand foreign competition. In fact, since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization began six years ago, Mexico has lost a large number of jobs in its uncompetitive manufacturing sectors, such as textiles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The only way Mexico could break out of this stalemate of low productivity and poverty was to open its economy. President Carlos Salinas and President Bush conceived of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a means of bolstering foreign investor confidence that the reforms would be enduring. Such confidence is essential to promoting Mexican investment because the inflationary economic policies of the modern era have depressed the country's savings rate and thus made Mexico temporarily dependent on foreign capital inflows to rebuild the economy. While every Western Hemisphere nation is now a capital importer, Mexico's external savings deficit is one of the largest (5% to 6% of gross domestic product) and would be difficult to finance without a high level of international confidence in the country's economic future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico embraced protectionist <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment policies after 1910 in order to escape from \"Yankee imperialism.\" It would be richly ironic if its efforts to escape from the mistakes of that revolution were now undermined by a loss of economic self-confidence in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. cannot stop Mexico from correcting the policy errors that followed the 1910 revolution. It can either attempt to guide the process through agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which contains more protection for the environment and U.S. workers than previous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, or it can let Mexico act unilaterally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico will not return to the corporatist and protectionist policies that undermined its economy in the past. Instead, it will probably enact much of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> unilaterally and then aggressively promote both investment and exports through a cheap exchange rate and a benign regulatory environment toward business, including less rigorous environmental policies than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would require.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress can pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and thus set an example of guided change in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy for the other three billion to four billion people living in formerly state-dominated economic systems who now want to return to the global marketplace, or, by failing to pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it can encourage them to act unilaterally. Such unilateralism would encourage them to pursue export growth through currency depreciation, permissive environmental regulation, restrictions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions and other repressive policies more reminiscent of statist economic systems than of the Western democratic and capitalist model they have been trying to emulate since 1989.    ---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hale is chief economist of Kemper Corp. in Chicago.</p>\n"}

The Senate and the Bush Administration are threatening sanctions or tariffs against China, while the GOP majority in Congress is having trouble mustering the votes to expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the poorest countries of Central America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'll save China for another day, but if Congress can't pass Cafta -- the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- everyone will begin reassessing America's global economic leadership. A House vote is scheduled for May, and too many Members are running for cover, thanks especially to the sugar and textile lobbies. It's a sign of Washington's bizarro-world quality that two industries that together account for a fraction of U.S. GDP are nonetheless wagging the Beltway.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta would expand the market for U.S. goods with the 44 million consumers in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, as well as with the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. As it happens, thanks to earlier <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws, the U.S. market is already quite open to their goods. Nearly 80% of goods from the six Cafta countries currently enter the U.S. duty-free. Two-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was $31.9 billion in 2003, according to the Cato Institute, making the Cafta region America's 13th largest trading partner -- bigger than Brazil, Singapore or Australia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta would return the favor by eliminating most tariffs on U.S. exports to the region. On motor vehicles and parts, Cafta countries levy an average tariff of 11% while the U.S. rate is zero. On vegetables, fruits and nuts, the Cafta region's average is 16.7%, again compared with zero in the U.S. On grains, it is 10.6% to zero; and on meat products, it's 14.7% while the U.S. rate is 3%. Cafta would remove these disparities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One big winner under Cafta would be U.S. agriculture, which has seen its market share fall in the region as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have given preferential access to Canada, the European Union and South American countries. The average tariff on U.S. agricultural exports to the region is 11% and reaches as high as 150%, says the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that U.S. farm exports to the region -- $1.6 billion in 2003 -- would increase by $1.5 billion a year when Cafta is fully implemented. The winners would include the feed, potato, pork, grain, corn, milk, oilseed, soybean and meat industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Cafta could still fail because of the opposition of the economically tiny, but politically gigantic, sugar industry. This is all the more astonishing when you consider how little sugar \"opening\" Cafta really allows. American sugar import quotas would rise by all of 1% of the U.S. market in the first year. After 15 long years of phased-in \"liberalization,\" sugar imports would rise to the magnificent level of 1.7%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oh -- and did we mention that the government price supports that keep U.S. sugar prices two and half times the world market would be preserved? The International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission forecasts that prices could decrease between 0.25% and 1.2%, estimates which the Grocery Manufacturers of America says \"are almost certainly overstated.\" And yet the U.S. sugar lobby -- a few families in Florida, Texas and Louisiana, plus sugar beet farmers in the Midwest -- can't tolerate even this much competition because it fears the political precedent. Big Sugar's Beltway clout is a bipartisan scandal that deserves a lot more media scrutiny.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, as ever there is the textile lobby, which wants it both ways on Cafta. On the one hand, Cafta will help some of the U.S. industry compete with China, especially by providing a market for American fabric. (Chinese garment makers typically use their own fabric.) At the same time, the textile lobby wants to block fabric makers in Mexico and Canada from selling cloth to Cafta countries for apparel that could then be exported duty-free to the U.S. The idea is to force Cafta apparel makers to buy U.S. fabric only. But if that happens, those same companies might simply move to China anyway, for lower costs and to avoid the hassle. In the end, that would cost even more U.S. fabric-making jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another familiar opponent is the AFL-CIO, which is putting special pressure on Democrats. So far only two House Democrats -- Henry Cuellar of Texas and William Jefferson of Louisiana -- have come out in favor of Cafta. One of Big Labor's objections is that Cafta merely requires the countries to enforce their own labor and environmental laws. It wants the U.S. to force them to abide by standards closer to our own -- as if the U.S. had the same standards when it was much poorer, and as if Congress would tolerate such foreign intrusion today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta of course rhymes with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and it's worth remembering that the \"giant sucking sound\" that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> critics predicted 12 years ago never did happen. The U.S. economy has continued to prosper and create jobs, while more opportunities have been opened for Mexicans inside Mexico. If Cafta fails because Congress fears competition from El Salvador, imagine what they'll conclude in Beijing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: No Significant Job or Wage Loss Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" -- WSJ May 4, 2005)</p>\n"}
{"id": "431724907.xml", "text": "<h2>The Summit of the Americas</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush will make his first important appearance at an international gathering this weekend, at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, an assemblage of 34 hemispheric heads of state. No other president entered office having emphasized the importance of ties with Latin America to the extent that Mr. Bush did on the campaign trail. His election has therefore raised expectations throughout a continent that often felt neglected by the Clinton administration. Mr. Bush's principal aim at this meeting is to reaffirm the worthy goal of achieving a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas by the year 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During President Clinton's second term, the United States abdicated its global leadership role in expanding free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. After securing the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and the enunciation of the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area concept at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, Mr. Clinton lost his ''fast track'' authority from Congress to negotiate amendment-proof <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, an essential precondition for any meaningful talks. Then he failed at the 1999 World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization gathering in Seattle to fashion a compromise between Democrats' desire to link <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to labor and environmental standards and developing nations' resistance to such linkage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is vitally important, both for American interests and for the future of impoverished nations around the world, that President Bush now break that impasse. He needs to assign high priority to reassembling a bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill  to grant the president fast-track or ''<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion'' power. The administration has wisely signaled a willingness to incorporate basic labor and environmental standards into any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bush administration needs to proceed with a sense of urgency, lest Central and South American leaders conclude that Washington is not serious about affording their economies the same direct access to American markets and investment capital that has proven so beneficial to Mexico as a result of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Such an impression could undermine the cause of free markets and liberalization in the hemisphere and sour America's relations with Latin America, which on balance have been highly positive in recent years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once he obtains fast-track negotiating power,  President Bush ought to conclude a deal with Chile, South America's most open economy and a country that was promised entry into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> back in 1993. Chile is a heartening example of how a policy of economic liberalization can lift a people's standard of living. Brazil has misgivings about opening its markets and would like to see South America negotiate as a united front, but a bilateral U.S. deal with Chile would build momentum for the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area multilateral talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On a wider front, the administration should make clear that it does not intend to pursue only a hemispheric <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. A summit in Qatar later in the year will pursue the possibility of launching a new round of World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization talks. As a proponent of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and free markets, the United States should be willing to negotiate a reduction of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers with any and all interested parties so long as fundamental labor and environmental standards are observed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Contrary to the claims made by the anti-globalization protesters who are out in force in Quebec, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization and economic globalization offer poor nations the best opportunity for improving their standards of living. There are no models for the notion that less interdependence with the global economy is a recipe for success.</p>\n"}
{"id": "293479733.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade With Latin America: A Tale of Huge Numbers; The issue should be high on the Clinton agenda</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three issues dominate current U.S. policy toward Latin America: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, drug trafficking and immigration. As President Clinton begins his second term, he would do well to give free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the Americas the highest priority. Numbers alone can provide a strong argument for that choice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to its southern neighbors have grown at a remarkable pace in recent years, even though there are still too many tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in Latin America. The value of those exports will exceed $100 billion in 1996. If this trend continues, the figure will rise to an staggering $240 billion annually by 2010, more than the current combined U.S. exports to Europe and Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An export-oriented economy means not just higher profits for U.S. businesses but more jobs and better pay for American workers. Manufacture and exports of goods like electrical appliances, industrial machinery and automobiles require skilled labor that demands the highest wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration should take the lead in the move toward full regional economic integration. At the Miami Summit of the Americas in December 1994, the president proposed establishing a hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone by 2005. The Mexican financial crisis later that month all but scuttled that recommendation, and this year's U.S. presidential campaign gave rise to a few voices from America's protectionist past, casting another shadow over the idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Clinton would serve this country and its hemispheric neighbors well by picking up the banner of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> again. Mexico is climbing back to its feet, edging toward economic recovery--an accomplishment that should be credited in part to the strong foundation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Safely reelected, Clinton could turn his attention to accepting an eager Chile under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tent, bolstering the strength and stretch of the alliance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obviously the White House cannot achieve this independently. Congress should grant the president so-called \"fast track\" authority to negotiate a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Chile. In July, the president must send Congress a report on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s progress.

But the emotional matters of drug trafficking and illegal immigration should not be allowed to become irritants to progress on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which, ultimately, can improve Latin American economies and thus diminish the pressures that drive these two problems. Some would argue that an economic boom south of the U.S. border would keep at home many job seekers who otherwise would illegally enter this country.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) railed on Sunday night. As the presidential campaign moves to the Rust Belt, the socialist contender is doubling down on protectionism. His stance is built on bogus numbers that defy the overwhelming consensus among economists, and his solutions would do much more harm than good. But politically, it appears to be working.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Sanders won the Michigan Democratic primary on Tuesday, exit polls indicated that his anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda helped him. Fifty-seven percent of those who voted agreed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \"takes away U.S. jobs,\" and 56 percent of them picked Mr. Sanders. Those figures augur poorly for Hillary Clinton's prospects in the Midwest -- and for the political durability of the country's commitment to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's unfortunate, as Mr. Sanders's populist rhetoric doesn't stand up to scrutiny. His insistence, for example, that the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement led to 800,000 job losses ignores analyses from unbiased sources such as the Congressional Research Service. \"In reality, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics,\" a 2015 CRS analysis found.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Blaming freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for the loss of manufacturing jobs fails to tell the much bigger story of economic transformation that has swept the world over the past several decades. Technological change, automation, productivity improvements and other factors have eliminated old-school manufacturing jobs all over the world. Mr. Sanders cannot bring back the U.S. economy of the 1960s, and it would be harmful to try.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sanders's story also neglects to mention the broad benefits that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> brings. It pulls foreign trading partners out of poverty. It helps U.S. exporters, who account for an increasingly large share of American output. It enriches U.S. consumers, who get cheaper goods and greater selection. Economists resoundingly agree that these sorts of diffuse benefits outweigh the costs over time. Moreover, there are non-economic benefits, as well. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> helped turn Mexico from an antagonist into a regional partner. The much-maligned Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would knit the United States into the Asia-Pacific region for decades to come.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The downside is that freeing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> clearly exacts some costs in particular sectors, and those affected can be politically mobilized. The solution, though, is not to provoke international enmity and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict by adopting a hostile attitude toward would-be trading partners. The smart policy is embracing openness and pocketing the overall gains in wealth and prosperity, while maintaining a safety net to help those who lose out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, Ms. Clinton has failed to make these arguments, though they were a gospel of Bill Clinton's presidency. Instead, she has surrendered the issue by failing to stand up for the TPP. Mr. Sanders already has the protectionists' vote; Ms. Clinton would be wise to offer a positive alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "398803001.xml", "text": "<h2>Thinking Things Over: Open Nafta Borders? Why Not?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reformist Mexican President Vincente Fox raises eyebrows with his suggestion that over a decade or two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should evolve into something like the European Union, with open borders for not only goods and investment but also people. He can rest assured that there is one voice north of the Rio Grande that supports his vision. To wit, this newspaper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We annually celebrate the Fourth of July with a paean to immigration, the force that tamed this vast continent and built this great Republic. This is not simply history; immigration continues to refresh and nourish America; we would be better off with more of it. Indeed, during the immigration debate of 1984 we suggested an ultimate goal to guide passing policies -- a constitutional amendment: \"There shall be open borders.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The naysayers who want to limit or abolish immigration look backward to a history they do not even understand. Each new immigrant group has been derided as backward, unclean, crime-ridden and so on; each has gone on to adopt the American dream of a free and independent people, and to win advancement economically, politically, socially. The ability to assimilate is the heart of the American genius, precisely the trait that sets the United States off from other nations. Immigration makes the U.S. what it is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Fourth of July we celebrate this history more forthrightly than we have in two decades. Anti-immigrant hysteria peaked in 1996, when the California Republican Party self-destructed with anti-immigrant themes. Today the GOP is led by George W. Bush, who told campaign audiences \"family values do not stop at the Rio Grande.\" The employer sanctions in the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli bill are now recognized as windmill tilting. Congress has repeatedly raised the limits on H-1B visas for engineers and such, to 195,000 a year from an original 65,000. Last week the U.S. Supreme Court twice held that aliens are people too, entitled to such basic rights as the presumption of innocence, petty 1996 legislation notwithstanding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, the U.S. is gradually relearning the secret of assimilation -- every informal recognition of cultural differences but no formal ones. \"Bilingual education,\" which trapped schoolchildren in a Hispanic ghetto for the benefit of ethnic politicians and a few teachers, is on its way out. Racial quotas generally are under increasing suspicion. In the next census, in 2010, increasingly meaningless and irritating questions about ethnicity may be abolished. This too bodes well for future acceptance of immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration now runs about a million a year against a population of 275 million, a rate that remains below the historical average. The proportion of immigrants with postgraduate education is three times the native rate. New immigrants are no longer eligible for welfare, removing that bugaboo. A study by the National Research Council in 1997 found that while unschooled immigrants are net recipients of taxpayer money in the first generation, their children repay these costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About half of current immigrants are Hispanic, though the Asian component is projected to grow rapidly. By far the largest single source is President Fox's Mexico, a Third World nation of nearly 100 million inhabitants sharing a 2,000-mile border with the U.S. The opportunity north of the border is inevitably a huge magnet for the poor but ambitious. There is no realistic way to stop the resulting flow of people -- certainly no way that would be acceptable to the American conscience.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was headlined last May when five sunburned and dehydrated survivors staggered up to Border Patrol agents in a desert called \"The Devil's Path\" about 25 miles north of the Arizona-Sonora border. Searchers found six more survivors, then 14 bodies. Smugglers had abandoned the group in 115-degree heat without water. This is no isolated instance; last year 491 souls perished trying to immigrate. With the U.S. Border Patrol doubled by the 1996 act, these victims were forced to risk death in increasingly desperate corridors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sealing the border against people willing to risk death is not a practical option, let alone a morally attractive one. The only hope is to manage the flow of people in a constructive and humane way. As President Fox says, \"By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Item one in any agenda to ease border problems would be rapid economic development to provide opportunity within Mexico. It's entirely possible that Mexico will become the next tiger economy. It has the huge advantage of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the world's largest market. For all its poverty, it has a large first-world economic sector and a technocratic elite educated at the best American universities. Contrary to stereotypes, the general population is exceptionally hard-working. Politically President Fox promises a fresh start after ending 71 years of one-party rule. If Mexico can avoid the currency depredations that have marred its last quarter-century, the immigration problem may start to fade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North of the border, the solution to the problem of illegal immigration is to make it legal, or at least to normalize the movement of people. A program of temporary work visas would allow Mexicans to go home; the incentive for undocumented aliens now is to stay rather than face the border barrier a second time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laws and regulations can generally be made more generous. The 1996 Border Patrol expansion is a dubious expense, expanding a cops-and-robbers game that sometimes turns deadly. After the 14 deaths in May, the Mexicans promised to patrol their side of the border in especially dangerous areas, while the Border Patrol promised to arm agents with pepper balls rather than bullets. During the campaign, President Bush talked of dividing the Immigration and Naturalization Service into two agencies, one to police the border and another to aid immigrants already here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another amnesty for undocumented aliens is already in the air; every decade or so Congress somehow or another faces this reality. Even opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> borders completely, I would dare to suggest, might not unleash a new flood of immigrants. There is a limit to the number who actually want to come, and experience suggests that many of those who do already can find a way. And after all, we did have a long history of unlimited quotas for Western Hemisphere immigrants, ending only in 1965.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Fox is nothing if not a visionary. Many scoffed at his ambition to unseat the machine that had run Mexico for generations; now they scoff at his proposals on immigration. But over the decade or two he mentioned, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with open borders may yet prove not so wild a dream.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1916993954.xml", "text": "<h2>The Midwest's stake in NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bombarded by wild claims from both sides, many Americans are confused about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Here in Illinois and the Midwest, however, we can't afford to be ambivalent. The state and the region stand to gain substantially from the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. ... Illinois will benefit from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because of the state's diverse economy and central location.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>- Editorial, Chicago Tribune, Oct. 10, 1993</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Editorial writers have no special ability to foresee the future, but when we predicted 24 years ago that Illinois would gain from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, we have to say, we pretty much nailed it. Back then, business tycoon Ross Perot portrayed the accord as an economic disaster for the United States - sounding much like another business tycoon often heard lately. But for Americans in general and Illinoisans in particular, that claim turned out to be wrong.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With its agricultural goods and manufactured products, the Midwest always had a lot to offer to foreign buyers. But high tariffs in Mexico got in the way. In 1993, Illinois exported less than $6.4 billion in goods to our two North American neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect, and the barriers started coming down. By 2003, this state's exports to Canada and Mexico were $10.7 billion, an increase of 69 percent, and the growth just kept on. In 2015, these countries bought more than $26 billion worth of stuff from the Land of Lincoln - 41 percent of our state's total exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You may think most of them come from our world-class farms. In fact, the state's two biggest overall export categories are machinery and chemicals. But yes, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners do like to eat. Mexico's total imports of corn and soybeans have skyrocketed under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Donald Trump, however, is no fan of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and he has set out to renegotiate it. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that. Any agreement reached when \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" was a hit TV show is bound to have room for updating. Talks with Mexico are expected to start in August.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One obvious place for improving U.S. access to Mexican markets is energy. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was being hammered out, the Mexicans insisted on protecting their oil and gas sector. Today, the U.S. exports far more petroleum than it did then, and Mexico is keen on assuring a steady supply of our newly abundant production. So the two countries should be able to agree on changes that will make it easier for us to sell oil and gas and easier for them to buy it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is also room for damage to U.S. exporters, particularly those in the Midwest. \"In a field where products are essentially interchangeable - Argentinian corn works just as well as American - being able to offer cheaper products to consumers abroad via free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements is vital to opening and keeping markets,\" The Washington Post reports. Disagreements that lead to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products could deprive American exporters of a large volume of sales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tough talk meant to extract concessions could backfire. \"We are concerned that growing rhetoric is creating an environment in which Mexican buyers feel they need to look at alternate suppliers, which could affect U.S. market share,\" the U.S. Grains Council told Reuters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just Illinois that has much at stake. Trump might keep in mind that an outsize share of the corn, soybeans and dairy products that ship to Mexico and Canada originate in Midwestern states - including some (Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin) that were crucial to his Electoral College victory.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supports a wealth of jobs and opportunity in the American heartland, just as expected when it was being negotiated by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, and his Democratic successor, Bill Clinton. When the president who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" gets serious about improving the accord, we hope he'll make sure not to give up those gains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this.

{"id": "421359728.xml", "text": "<h2>Clinton Crashes Again on a Fast Track; The president fails to rally his own party on key trade issue</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton's hot pursuit of renewed \"fast track\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> authority hit a roadblock erected by his fellow Democrats. There is a lesson here for the White House, which Monday had to postpone a House vote on the matter for the second time this session. The president allowed the issue to be muddied and hijacked by Democrats who claim they were double-crossed after they backed him on a fast-track deal for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement in 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so renewal of fast-track <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> authority has been tabled again, until next year. The embarrassing setback at least provides time for heads to cool and reason to prevail among Democrats. Ultimately, fast track should be approved. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has been and will continue to be an engine of U.S. economic growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fast-track authority allows a president to negotiate broad <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements over which Congress has a simple yes or no vote. The agreements cannot be amended by either chamber, so U.S. trading partners are assured their agreements with the administration will be respected. Since 1974, Congress has granted every president such authority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this Congress, most House Democrats have supported the organized labor and environmental groups that oppose fast track, in part on grounds that cheaper foreign labor and lower environmental standards give U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners an unfair advantage. These Democrats believe that Clinton did not keep promises concerning strong labor and environmental conditions on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration erred in its timing as well as its strategy on fast track. It waited, despite contrary advice from Republican leaders, until autumn to push for the agreement and then focused its campaign only at the last minute. By then political opponents had moved in.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This congressional round over fast track is indirectly tied to the administration's goal of bringing Chile into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Over a longer term, Clinton has said he wants authority to seek a much broader free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement for the Americas and to craft a pact with Asian-Pacific nations, which have promised to have free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the region by 2010.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With good reason, fast track has drawn bipartisan support in the past. Washington cannot afford to have complicated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> alliances pecked apart in Congress by partisan or geographical meddling. Clinton will have to try again, and try harder and smarter.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398993643.xml", "text": "<h2>Unilateral Democrats</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats claim the world hates America because President Bush has behaved like a global bully.

At their Ohio debate on Tuesday, first Mrs. Clinton, followed ever so quickly by Mr. Obama, pledged to pull America out of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement if the two countries don't agree to rewrite it on Yankee terms. How's that for global \"unilateralism\"?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats sure have come a long way from the 1990s, when Bill Clinton pushed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> through a Democratic Congress. And the truth is that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have spoken favorably about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the past. Yet now they are sounding the loudest protectionist notes by a potential President in decades. More dangerous, neither is telling the truth about the role of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the U.S. economy. If either one makes it to the White House, he or she will carry the weight of this campaign protectionism while trying to lead the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While it is politically incorrect to say so, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good for all of North America. By opening the continent to investment and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, capital has found more efficient uses, with benefits to producers and consumers alike. In <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s first decade after 1993, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the U.S. and Mexico multiplied to $232 billion from $81 billion. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> with Canada has also blossomed, with Canadian exports to the U.S. by surface transport rising 79% in a decade and U.S. exports to Canada increasing 38%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal also increased U.S. productivity. U.S. firms found they could be more globally competitive by putting some manufacturing in Mexico or Canada while retaining high-end production in the U.S. This has resulted in what John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, has called \"the highly integrated North American industrial base, particularly between Canada and the U.S.\" Such flexibility may have saved thousands of U.S. jobs from going abroad. In the first 10 years of the deal, the U.S. economy added 18 million jobs and the jobless rate sank to record lows.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has also been crucial to Mexico's continuing development. After the 1994 peso devaluation, the political left in Mexico had all the ammunition it needed to turn back liberalization. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> made that difficult. In the two presidential elections since the 1994-1995 peso crisis, Mexicans have voted for a modern economy. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has helped Mexico develop strong retail competition for the first time and allowed the economy to diversify beyond oil. Other gains include greater transparency in Mexico's fiscal accounts, an independent central bank and an inflation rate that is now lower than in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this counts with Mr. Obama, who is whacking Mrs. Clinton for saying in 2004 that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had been good for New York state and the country. He also points out that \"in her own book Senator Clinton called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 'one of Bill's successes.'\" Instead of defending the economic record of the 1990s, Mrs. Clinton's response has been to call for a \"time out\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, as if the world won't build new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs without America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Illinois Senator is less than honest about his own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> history. In his race for his Senate seat in 2004, he told Illinois farmers that the U.S. benefits from exports under the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and he recommended that the U.S. go after more deals like it. He also discouraged protectionism, warning that \"as an exporting state, Illinois would be hurt by a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war sparked by tariffs. This would be particularly devastating to our agricultural economy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that was when he was trying to appeal to farmers who rely on exports. Now that he's battling for union endorsements, Mr. Obama says he \"would immediately call the president of Mexico, the president of Canada [we presume he meant the prime minister], to try to amend <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, because I think that we can get labor agreements in that agreement right now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he doesn't mention is that our trading partners might not want to reopen a pact that the U.S. hasn't yet even fully implemented, as in the failure to allow Mexican trucks onto U.S. highways. The Teamsters, who endorsed Mr. Obama last week, have blocked that one. Mexico and Canada may also want to protect more of their agricultural markets in return for \"labor agreements,\" harming U.S. farmers or other efficient U.S. exporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Democratic contest continues, it is becoming a race to the bottom on protectionism. Perhaps the best <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> demagogue will win, but someone should point out that the last President who tried to govern as a protectionist was Herbert Hoover. It didn't turn out so well.</p>\n"}

Isolationist conservatives, emboldened by their jihad last year against the Dubai Ports World deal, have identified this road project as the spearhead of a conspiracy to dissolve the United States of America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The corridor is a proposed two-phase project meant to ensure that the Lone Star State has the transportation infrastructure necessary to handle the growing international commerce coming across the border. The 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has doubled U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, three-fourths of which flows through Texas. And the movement of goods through the state is expected to increase exponentially in the near future as Asia routes more exports through the newly expanded Panama Canal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas awarded a planning contract in 2005 for the first phase of the corridor to Cintra, a Spanish multinational company, and its San Antonio partner, Zachry Construction. (Cintra also won a $1.3- billion contract last year to build a 40-mile extension of Highway 130, a state toll road connecting Austin to San Antonio that was conceived separately from the corridor, although conspiracy activists claim otherwise.) The first 600-mile section, planned to include such features as tollways, freight-rail and truck-only lanes, will run parallel to the cramped, north-south Interstate 35 from the border town of Laredo to Oklahoma. Construction contracts for that portion haven't been awarded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second phase of the corridor, whose planning contract has yet to be handed out, would build a similar highway from the western edge of the Mexico border to east Texas. This might one day link to a separate, federally initiated eight-state expansion of Interstate 69, which currently runs between Port Huron, Mich., and Indianapolis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is all too sinister for Jerome Corsi, the Vietnam War veteran who helped lead the Swift Boat charge against John Kerry. Corsi has knitted disparate strands of each of these separate road projects to help convince fellow xenophobes such as Pat Buchanan, Phyllis Schlafly, Lou Dobbs and the John Birch Society that the corridor is the first leg of a secret federal project called the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Superhighway, a four-football-field wide monstrosity that would run from Mexico's Yucatan to Canada's Yukon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Never mind that I-69 originated in a 1991 federal transportation law -- pre-dating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- and that the planning for the Trans- Texas Corridor has been fully documented on the Web.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a libertarian Republican candidate for president, has fallen for the paranoia. You'd think that Paul would be chanting hosannas to anything that facilitates free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but he too fears that the \"superhighway\" is part of a scheme by foreign companies to erode U.S. borders and create a North American Union combining the United States, Mexico and Canada -- complete with a single government and a common currency called the \"amero.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Superhighway opponents regard even routine dialogue between the three neighbors as a treasonous assault on U.S. sovereignty. They are apoplectic about the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), a forum created in 2005 for bureaucrats to discuss such radical topics as how to snag terrorists before they enter the continent and how to speed up cross-border traffic for just-in-time deliveries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this could be dismissed as the paranoid rantings of a protectionist fringe -- except that it is beginning to have a tangible negative effect on public policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Montana's Legislature this summer overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the superhighway and any union of the three countries, and 18 other states are considering similar legislation. El Cajon Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter successfully amended the 2008 Transportation Appropriations Act to prohibit use of federal funds for any SPP working group. Virginia Republican Rep. Virgil H. Goode Jr. has introduced a House resolution against both the mythical superhighway and the fantasy union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Dubai Ports debacle, in which anti-terrorism hysteria forced Congress to thwart the transfer of U.S. port management leases held by a major British ports operator to a company based in Dubai, the atavistic idea that foreign investment erodes American sovereignty is back into vogue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hunter, for instance, has added hoops to the review process that foreign bidders for U.S. companies must go through to prove that they're not a national security threat. This limits the pool of buyers for U.S. companies, thereby lowering their value and the value of 401(k) plans that invest in them. Hunter has also extended the review process to foreign companies vying to build \"critical infrastructure.\" Should his definition include transportation projects, state governments would be deprived of crucial capital and knowledge to modernize their infrastructure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The paradox of protectionism is that it damages the very thing it seeks to protect. Labor unions, for example, almost killed U.S. auto and steel companies by helping erect barriers against foreign companies, which made domestic products globally noncompetitive. But the impact of today's isolationists threatens to affect the entire economy. If unchallenged, these ideologues of fear will kill the United States' prosperity in the name of protecting its sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:Tom Nick Cocotos For The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Shikha Dalmia is a senior analyst and Leonard Gilroy is a senior policy analyst at the Reason Foundation</p>\n"}
{"id": "409150644.xml", "text": "<h2>Bush's North American Agenda</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week's state visit by Mexican President Vicente Fox offers President Bush a unique opportunity not only to redefine relations with Mexico but also to lay the foundation for a North American Community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush clearly wants good relations with Mexico and a more humane policy on immigration. But the central issue is the income gap between Mexico and its North American neighbors. Fox has proposed incremental steps toward a common market as the way to reduce the gap. Bush needs to accept the idea, modify it or propose an alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its critics, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) succeeded in what it was designed to do. Today the United States exports nearly four times more to its two neighbors than to Japan and China, and 40 percent more than to the 15-nation European Union. In the 1990s, Mexico had the highest rate of export growth in the world, and Canadian investment in the United States grew twice as fast U.S. investment in Canada. Half of the three countries' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the world is with each other, and our firms have become continental and more competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s failure has come from what it omitted. The income gap between Mexico and its northern neighbors has not narrowed. Illegal migration has increased. If Europe built too many institutions, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> made the opposite mistake: It lacks institutions to anticipate or respond to crises or take advantage of opportunities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should the two presidents do? They should first invite Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to a North American summit. To make that meeting more productive than the one they had last April, they should establish a North American Commission to develop an agenda for that and future summits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the sprawling, regulatory European Commission, the North American one should be lean and advisory -- just 15 distinguished individuals, five from each of the countries. Their task would be to help the leaders think continentally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To deal with immigration and customs at the border, they could propose \"North American passports\" for frequent travelers, or \"North American Customs and Immigration Officers\" to cut the documentation in half and patrol the perimeter. Instead of grading each other's behavior against drug traffickers, as Washington currently does, we could work more effectively as partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Illegal migration will not be reduced until the income gap between Mexico and its northern neighbors is reduced. The European Union lifted its poorest countries: Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. From 1986 to 1999, the per capita gross domestic product of those countries rose from 65 percent to 78 percent of the EU average, and emigration slowed markedly. The astonishing progress was due to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and foreign investment, but mostly to the transfer of aid: from 2 percent to 4 percent of the recipient's GDP. The most effective projects were in infrastructure and education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is deliberately laissez-faire, but the result is that most foreign investment has concentrated in the congested, polluted border area, where it has served as a magnet attracting workers from the heart of Mexico. From there, many immigrate illegally to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foreign companies would prefer to invest in the interior (where the workforce would be more stable), but the roads and infrastructure are inadequate. The World Bank estimates it needs $20 billion a year for 10 years just for infrastructure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The three leaders should establish a North American Development Fund, whose priority would be to connect the border to central and southern Mexico. If roads were built, investors would come, immigration would decline and income disparities would narrow. If Mexico's growth rate leaped to twice that of its neighbors, the psychology of the people and their relationships would be transformed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is much more that a North American Commission could propose: a continental plan for infrastructure and transportation, a plan for harmonizing regulatory policies, a customs union, and a common currency. But the boldest accomplishment of the state visit would be if Bush and Fox were to agree to establish a development fund. They wouldn't need to create a new bureaucracy; the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank could administer it. But it would need an injection of funding comparable to the Alliance for Progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada could contribute in proportion to their wealth, but the United States needs to lead. Fox has focused on migration because he knows that Mexicans want respect from the United States. But the only solution to our one-sided relationship is narrowing the income disparities between our two countries. That should be the centerpiece of the summit and the building block of a North American community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a professor of political science at Emory University and author of \"Toward a North American Community: Lessons From the Old World for the New.\"</p>\n"}
{"id": "421765949.xml", "text": "<h2>Release the Brakes on NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A five-member panel of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Assn. has unanimously ruled the United States out of compliance with alliance rules in denying Mexican truckers permission to cross the border and deliver their goods inside the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The panel, composed of two Americans, two Mexicans and a British chairman, said Washington had the prerogative to impose safety standards on any truck entering the country but must consider each applicant on its merits. In other words, there is no justification to deny entry to any Mexican truck in compliance with federal and state safety standards that apply to U.S. trucks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bush administration should honor the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel's decision. During the debate nearly a decade ago on the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, Washington successfully insisted on allowing free travel of trucks on both sides of the border as long as they met mutual safety standards. Subsequently, then-President Bill Clinton, influenced by the powerful Teamsters Union, declared all Mexican trucks unsafe and countermanded the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ruling. Currently Mexican truckers can drive only about 20 miles north of the border and then must transfer their loads to U.S. trucks. With bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> at $250 billion a year, this delay causes big problems for truckers and consumers alike.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meeting U.S. safety standards won't be easy for Mexican trucks, which on average are older than American trucks. Codes vary from state to state, and California's are very strict. So far, about 184 Mexican trucking companies have applied for permission to deliver loads across the U.S. border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rules, Mexican trucking companies' fleets would be inspected by U.S. agents. The details, including frequency of inspections, are yet to be worked out. If Washington and Mexico City support <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and both insist they do, it's time that they agree on sensible safety standards and get the trucks rolling.</p>\n"}

So it's a puzzle that on one of his signature achievements -- the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- the party's presidential candidates are sprinting away from his record as fast as they can. It's as though Republicans were calling for defense cuts while invoking Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even Hillary Clinton can't bring herself to defend the deal her husband pushed through.

Barack Obama is on record as saying he \"would not have supported the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement as it was drafted.\" John Edwards has flogged the treaty like a rented mule, calling it \"a complete and total disaster.\" And Dennis Kucinich thinks all copies of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should be humanely shredded and used as compost on shade-grown fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> coffee, or something like that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What did <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ever do to deserve this abuse? Critics claim it destroyed a million jobs -- forgetting that its implementation coincided with the longest peacetime expansion in American history. During that period, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since the Vietnam War. If that was a disaster, I'm Hannah Montana.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ordinary workers, contrary to myth, benefited from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In the decade before it took effect, average hourly earnings (adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the decade after, they rose by 9 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even supposing the deal did eliminate a million jobs, that actually doesn't amount to much. Every year, millions of jobs vanish and millions materialize as old companies cut back or close and new ones sprout. What counts is net growth. Since 1994, when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect, the total number of jobs in this country has risen by 26 million.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidates blame <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for pushing American companies to close plants here and move production south. But from 1994 to 2001, U.S. manufacturers invested $200 billion a year at home -- and only $2.2 billion a year in Mexico, the Cato Institute reports. After <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed, U.S. manufacturing output soared, and it's now at the highest level ever. American farmers have seen their exports boom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From listening to the Democrats, you'd never guess that our exporters got more out of the deal than Mexico's did. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> actually made it easier for U.S. companies to stay here and sell products in Mexico. How? By phasing out tariffs on goods shipped there -- which, on average, were 2 1/2 times higher than ours. We gave nickels to get dimes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edwards and Co. hold fast to the superstition that tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers are essential to our prosperity. The reality is that admitting imports makes Americans more prosperous by reducing prices of consumer and capital goods. It also strengthens American companies by forcing them to be more efficient and innovative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why do so many people, including approximately 100 percent of those who turn up at Democratic debates, hold this and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements in such contempt? One obvious reason is they want to appeal to labor unions, which generally prefer protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, suspects one reason lies in a different issue: illegal immigration. Some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporters thought it might generate enough growth in Mexico to keep Mexican workers at home. When the tide of illegal immigrants grew, it bred resentment here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That reaction partly helps to explain the Democratic retreat. By denouncing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the presidential candidates can appeal to Americans alarmed about our porous borders without offending Hispanic voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But they should remember two crucial things: Bill Clinton presided over an era of enviable prosperity, and he did more to expand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> than any president since Franklin Roosevelt. If they want to get back to the land of Oz, Democrats would be advised to follow the same yellow brick road.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: schapman@tribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: Graphic: Average hourly earnings before and after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>In the decade before the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement took effect, average hourly earnings (adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent.

{"id": "1474168043.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta at 20: A Model for Trade Policy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to take for granted the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which turned 20 years old last week. Those who predicted that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would lead to joblessness and poverty have been proven definitively wrong. Freedom to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the neighbors (Canada, Mexico and the U.S.) has instead created wealth and opportunity and made the continent more globally competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s stellar performance won't keep pace with rising expectations if North American integration is not deepened. And that won't happen without vision and leadership. For inspiration, I recommend a look back at the creation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>David Ricardo couldn't have dreamed up a better example than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> of how voluntary exchange makes all parties better off. A continental web of supply chains now supports production facilities and serves consumers in three countries with a combined population of 470 million. An estimated 40% of the content of imports to the U.S. from Mexico, and 25% of what Americans buy from Canada, originated in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In everything from agriculture to aerospace, producers in North America now draw on comparative advantages in design, technology, labor and component manufacturing throughout the continent. This more dynamic region takes on competitors like China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet if continental interconnectedness has become routine, it was never inevitable. Before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, genuine free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements were rare, and even rarer between a developed country like the U.S. and a developing economy like Mexico's. Let's remember too that all three countries had powerful special interests bent on hanging on to the privileges of protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In December I was invited to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University for a panel discussion about the past and future of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Participants included the three top <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiators: American Carla Hills, CanadianMichael Wilson and Mexico's Jaime Serra Puche.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Wilson kicked things off with Canadian (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>) war stories. He noted that the 1965 auto pact, which removed tariffs on vehicles and parts, marked the birth of \"the North American supply chain.\" It wasn't free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but it was a crack in the door that let in light. Canada wanted more access to the U.S. market. On Jan. 2, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the U.S.-Canada Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a huge political risk, as the federal election in November of that year -- still known in Canada as \"the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> election\" -- proved. \"It was fierce,\" Mr. Wilson recalled. Mr. Mulroney prevailed but only after \"he took off his jacket and fought.\" His Conservatives won the election but lost 34 seats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Less than two years later, in the winter of 1990, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Hills and her Mexican counterpart, Mr. Serra Puche, had a discussion in Davos, Switzerland, about a bilateral agreement. Mrs. Hills told the Hoover panel that she brought the idea to President George H.W. Bush and in August \"Jaime and I issued a report, saying it was a good idea.\" Mr. Bush agreed and announced that the U.S. \"would pursue a bilateral.\" Canada's Mulroney government wanted in. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations were launched.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These visionaries also had to be salesmen. Mrs. Hills went on the offensive. Her team \"intensified our meetings with Congress,\" attended the governor's conference in Seattle in 1991, and took a congressional delegation to Mexico. She spoke at a textile manufacturing convention, where she \"got booed.\" Listening to Mrs. Hills, I'd say she relished the fight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under President Carlos Salinas, the cultural fabric of Mexico's one-party corporatist system was coming apart. The economy had been \"highly protected for five or six decades,\" Mr. Serra Puche pointed out, and there were \"huge distortions in prices.\" To build support for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the Mexico team worked to show the business community that the reliance on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> preferences was hurting competitiveness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> dreamers came from different worlds. But they held in common the belief that more freedom would make life better for all North Americans. Never did they shrink from their main challenge, which was to persuade skeptics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bill Clinton, who took office in January 1993 when the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal was on the one-yard line, played a key role in getting it across the goal line. According to his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Mickey Kantor, who was also at the Hoover gathering, the Clinton team ran into trouble with the Florida congressional delegation. To break the impasse, Mr. Clinton told him: \"Open the candy store.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Hills said she would have \"liked to have seen immigration and energy as part of the deal. It would have avoided many problems today.\" The Obama administration's decision to block TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline comes to mind. Some panel participants commented that the Keystone stall threatens to undermine confidence in the good faith of the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not too late. But now, as then, expanding economic freedom in North America requires a commitment to the cause. Regrettably that is in short supply in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}

Congress should move on the president's request at once.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Every administration since 1974 has enjoyed the essential tool of fast-track negotiating authority. It commits Congress to consider and vote, without amendment, on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals within 90 days of their submission by the president. Its benefit is obvious: No foreign government is inclined to enter into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the U.S. only to have Congress change the agreements later on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress failed to renew fast-track authority in 1994, following the bitter political debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.

Meanwhile, some European and Asian competitors have moved in to close their own treaties with some Latin American countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. labor unions fear competition from cheaper foreign labor while environmentalists fear ecological degradation by Third World countries with lower pollution standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And as the presidential hopefuls begin to move into position, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri is reaching for the baton to lead the chorus of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> opponents and position himself against Vice President Al Gore in the Democratic primaries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the dire consequences predicted by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opponents--most notably Ross Perot's \"sucking sound\" of jobs being siphoned off by Mexico--have not materialized. An analysis released by the Clinton administration in July concluded that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had had a \"modest positive effect\" on the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, in fact, has been more successful than that. It has accelerated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between its three partners--the U.S., Mexico and Canada--by 44 percent. There is no concrete evidence that the U.S. has suffered a net loss of jobs from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or that it would do so if Chile joined the pact. Indeed, in the wake of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s approval, the U.S. has enjoyed employment and economic growth envied by much of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> means jobs and opportunity.

That skepticism disregards the considerable competitive advantage the agreement has given the United States and, in turn, transformed North America into a global powerhouse.<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was signed in 1993, when the economy was much simpler. We have a unique chance to take advantage of three countries meeting at the negotiation table in order to modernize the accord and to make it, once again, the world's state-of-the-art <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. To maintain North America's competitive edge, we have three ideas to update and improve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, rather than simply discarding it.First, the digital economy hardly existed in 1993; now it is a big part of the global economy and has to be incorporated into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That will benefit all companies, in particular small and medium enterprises that will use the internet to export to the region and worldwide.Second, reform <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> regulations concerning state-owned enterprises. Competition from these companies -- often government-subsidized -- is often unfair; a clause in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> regulating the participation of state-owned firms in North America would serve as an argument in favor of including a similar clause for World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization rules. That would level the playing field in global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries; the largest binational commercial deficit for each one is with China, which openly supports its state-owned companies.Third, government procurement in the three countries must be open to competition, with any North American company able to bid for jobs. In addition, severe measures to combat corruption should be added to the agreement.Being part of the North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone has helped United States manufacturing industries like auto, electronics and aerospace become more competitive, relative to their Asian and European competitors. This increased competitiveness results mainly from the development throughout the last 24 years of strong vertical supply chains that take advantage of economies of scale: Production takes place wherever it is most efficient. National borders matter relatively little, and final assembly generally has little to do with the national origin of the parts being assembled. Today, United States and Canadian manufacturers rely on Mexican suppliers to remain competitive and to be able to export their goods globally.We hear a lot about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, but repealing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements will not fix the arithmetic. If a country consumes more than it produces, it will import more than it exports. Federal deficit spending, a huge and continuing act of dissaving, is the big culprit. Control that, and you will control <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits.Imposing tariffs on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within North America would affect the demand and price of final goods imported by the United States from Mexico and Canada. It would also affect the demand for intermediate goods produced in the United States that are exported to Mexico and Canada for final assembly. In a 2010 study, nearly 40 percent of United States imports from Mexico were United States value-added, while about 25 percent of United States imports from Canada were United States value-added.Top categories for United States exports to Mexico and for United States imports from Mexico overlap: vehicles, machinery and electrical equipment. North American products cross borders often before reaching the consumer. Disrupting supply chains would have consequences not only for Mexico and Canada but also for United States exports.North American countries should be working toward greater integration in energy and national security. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was first negotiated, the energy sector was excluded because Mexico's oil, gas and electricity industries were controlled by the state. But in recent years, Mexico opened up the sector to competition and foreign investment. The three countries should push toward an integrated North American energy market; that will favor the energy independence and national security of the region.The United States, Mexico and Canada should secure the true border of North America: Mexico's southern border. One argument from the Trump administration to repeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States and the effect it has on its workers. The truth is that net migration from Mexico to the United States has been zero or even negative for roughly 10 years.

Consider three questions: Has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> served the American public? As a test case over a 2,000-mile border of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between developed and developing countries, is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a model for the future? What has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> accomplished for the people of Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the question of U.S. interests, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the removal of global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers through global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations have resulted in higher incomes and lower prices for goods, with annual benefits amounting to $1,300 to $2,000 for a family of four. The biggest beneficiaries are lower-income Americans who bear a disproportionate burden when goods are priced artificially high because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. It is no coincidence that the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history came in the aftermath of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Ross Perot claimed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would lead to \"a great sucking sound\" that would swallow U.S. jobs. He was right about a great sucking sound, but wrong about the effect: U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada have boomed under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and now support 2.9 million American jobs--900,000 more than in 1993. Such jobs pay 13% to 18% more than the average American wage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners increased 104% between 1993 and 2000; U.S. exports to the rest of the world grew half as fast. Today, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico is nearly half a million dollars a minute, and we export more to Mexico than to the combination of the four European members of the G-7: Britain, France, Germany and Italy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a model for north-south relations, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> represents a commitment by Mexico to modernize--politically and economically-- and a commitment by the U.S. and Canada to support this great change so we can realize the full potential of a new, larger North America. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a key to the political transformation of a modernizing Mexico. Last year, in the freest and most open presidential election in the country's history, Mexico elected a new president, Vicente Fox, from an opposition party for the first time since that nation's revolution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s opponents outside Mexico often claim they are defending the Mexican people against an agreement that has led to exploitation. But when Mexicans had the opportunity to speak for themselves, 80% voted for major-party candidates who endorsed North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has fueled Mexico's economic growth; more than half of the 3.5 million jobs created in Mexico since 1995 are connected to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has also promoted cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. Today, we are working together on issues from the environment and drugs to law enforcement and immigration. Earlier this year, as California faced an energy crisis, the Mexican state of Baja California stepped in to sell the San Diego area enough electricity to power 50,000 homes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also helped Mexico's resilience amid the challenges of globalization.

The other pledges to raise the barriers that Americans already face in global commerce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Latin America, this is the single most important policy issue in the campaign. If Republican candidate John McCain wins, he says he will lead the Western Hemisphere toward freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Conversely, Democratic candidate Barack Obama has promised that he will craft a U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy of greater protectionism against our Latin neighbors. The former agenda will advance regional economic integration, the latter will further Latin American isolation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone who has read 20th century history knows the seriousness of this policy divide. The last time Washington adopted a protectionist stance toward our southern neighbors was in 1930, when Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. It took more than 50 years to even begin to climb out of that hole.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many economists blame Smoot-Hawley for the depths of the U.S. depression. But Latin Americans have suffered even more over a longer period. Their leaders chose to retaliate at the time with their own protectionist tariffs, but the damage didn't end there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his 1995 book \"Crisis and Reform in Latin America,\" UCLA professor Sebastian Edwards writes that though there was a brief period of liberalization in Argentina, Brazil and Chile in the late 1930s, it didn't last long. Adverse conditions brought about by World War II prompted the region's policy makers to restore tariffs, in the hope that protectionism would stimulate economic development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"By the late 1940s and early 1950s,\" writes Mr. Edwards, \"protectionist policies based on import substitution were well entrenched and constituted, by far, the dominant perspective.\" The U.N.'s Economic Commission on Latin American and the Caribbean, he adds, provided the \"intellectual underpinning for the protectionist position.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protectionism made a mess out of the region, and not only because spiraling tariffs and nontariff barriers blocked imports and destroyed the export sector. They also provoked an intellectual isolation as the information and new ideas that flow with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dried up, along with consumer choice and competition. This had a deleterious effect on politics too, as closed economies spawned powerful interests which seized not only economic but political control and grew entrenched.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to Mr. Edwards, it was only in the late 1980s and early 1990s that U.S. and Latin leadership (not counting Chile, which liberalized earlier) began to recognize the twin unintended consequences of this model -- poverty and instability -- and decided to act. \"Tariffs were drastically slashed, many countries completely eliminated import licenses and prohibitions and several countries began negotiating free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the United States.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with the U.S. in 1993, but the regional opening process continued well into this decade. A U.S.-Chile bilateral agreement kicked off in 2004. Five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic signed their own FTA (Cafta) with the U.S. in 2006. Peru's FTA with the U.S. was finalized in 2007. Colombia and Panama have signed agreements with the U.S. that are awaiting ratification by the U.S. Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is true that unilateral opening would have been a superior path. Yet for a variety of reasons -- not the least the political attraction of reciprocity -- FTAs have become fashionable. And there is no doubt that the agreements, warts and all, have aided in the process of dismantling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, strengthening the rule of law, and moving the region in the direction of democratic capitalism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. McCain wants the U.S. to continue its leadership role in opening markets in the region. He favors ratification of the Colombia and Panama FTAs, which the Democratic-controlled Congress is blocking. He also wants to lift the U.S.'s 54-cent tariff on Brazilian ethanol, and he wants to preserve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Obama would reverse regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> progress. He supports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's opposition to the Colombia FTA, even though it will open new markets for U.S. exporters. He promises to \"stand firm\" against pacts like Cafta and proposes to force a renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which is likely to disrupt North American supply chains and damage the U.S. economy. By heaping new labor and environmental regulations on our trading partners, his \"fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" proposal will raise costs for our trading partners and reduce their competitiveness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps worst of all, his anti<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bias will signal the region that protectionism is back in style in the U.S., and encourage new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars. No good can come from that, for the U.S. or for Latin America.</p>\n"}
{"id": "408640185.xml", "text": "<h2>A Hero In Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many lessons to be drawn from Mexico's successful election. The most important one for U.S. policymakers is this: To deepen democracy in our hemisphere, we must resolve our domestic debate about the appropriate terms for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and extend the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement throughout the Americas. The much- derided <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the unsung hero of Mexico's peaceful democratic revolution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most of the last century, Mexico's nationalistic ruling party, the PRI, jealously guarded the nation's \"sovereignty,\" and declared its domestic politics--particularly its elections--off limits to outside scrutiny. In the 1988 presidential election, for instance, when the opposition appeared to be winning, computers in the government-controlled electoral council \"crashed\" mysteriously, and the official candidate, Carlos Salinas, was defiantly declared the winner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in 1994, when Mexico agreed to open its economy to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment flows from the United States and Canada, it also opened up the nation's internal politics to the scrutiny and standards of the larger, democratic community. The PRI understood that it could not attract new capital, technology, plants and equipment from the developed democracies while at the same time shutting off its internal policies. In the ensuing years, opposition political forces took full advantage of the electoral and press reforms that the PRI began to institute, and in 1997 captured the lower house of congress for the first time in Mexican history.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Election Day 2000, with the \"whole world watching\" in the form of international observers and press, ordinary Mexicans sensed that even if the ruling party wished to do so, it could not risk the international firestorm--and outflow of investor dollars--that would have resulted had it tried to steal the election. With the confidence that for the first time their votes would count, and less fearful of official retribution, Mexican citizens turned out in record numbers to evict the ruling party.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the United States was moving forward, after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s ratification, to expand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> throughout the Americas, it set off a competition among nations in Latin America and the Caribbean to reform their economies and clean up their politics to get to the head of the line. The hemisphere understood that Chile was designated by both the Bush and Clinton administrations to be the first to join <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, not just because it had led the process of market opening but also because it had carried out a successful transition from military dictatorship to electoral democracy. But after Congress refused in 1997 to grant the Clinton administration \"fast-track\" authority to negotiate with Chile, the momentum for market reform, and also democratization, diminished in Latin America, and so did U.S. leadership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Peru's recent presidential elections, for example, the Organization of American States condemned the electoral process as irreparably flawed by abuses of state power. The United States and Canada sought to rally OAS nations to declare the election invalid, but the most Latin America would do was send a high-level mission to negotiate reforms in Peru's \"democratic processes.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States needs to have a long-overdue domestic debate about the terms of expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the hemisphere. Critics of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement ask: If intellectual property rights must be respected as a condition of expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, why not also labor rights and environmental safeguards? The question deserves an answer. Labor rights have been part of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements almost since their inception: The General System of Preferences is tied directly by law to a nation's safeguarding the right of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to organize freely. Those who advocate such changes also bear a burden: to prove their goal is to improve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, not make them impossible to conclude. The two leading U.S. presidential candidates, both of whom supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, ought to be leading such a debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But critics who claim that free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> strengthen ruling political elites against the interests of ordinary citizens misread the hemisphere's history. Traditionally, powerful family groups prospered in Latin America's former closed economies by currying favor, often corruptly, with politicians and ruling parties, who would, in return, erect tariff barriers against competitors, issue preferential regulations and award lucrative licenses and contracts. Opening up those economies to competition and scrutiny breaks up those nests of entrenched power and liberates opposition forces to press for democratic change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexicans voted in record numbers not just to end 71 years of authoritarian rule: Eighty percent of them voted also for candidates who supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which helped make that vote possible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer was assistant secretary of state for inter-American Affairs from 1989 to 1993.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410154559.xml", "text": "<h2>Anti-Trade Democrats; How Will Bashing NAFTA Win Back the World?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite their spirited squabbling, the Democratic candidates are united in their view that one big benefit of electing either of them would be an improvement in America's reputation and relations with the world. Hillary Clinton promises to send special envoys to foreign capitals the day after she's elected. Barack Obama offers to reach out to America's foes as well as friends. Unfortunately, none of this will matter if they continue to spout dangerous, ill-informed rhetoric about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the rest of the world  --  particularly poorer countries  --  really wants is for the United States to continue its historic role in opening up the world economy. For a struggling farmer in Kenya, access to world markets is far more important than foreign aid or U.N. programs. If the candidates think they will charm the world while adopting protectionist policies, they are in for a surprise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already the mood is shifting abroad. Listening to the Democrats on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \"is enough to send jitters down the spine of most in India,\" says the Times Now TV channel in New Delhi. The Canadian media have shared in the global swoon for Obama, but Greg Weston recently wrote in the Edmonton Sun: \"What he is actually saying  --  and how it might affect Canada  --  may come as a surprise to otherwise devout Barack boosters.\" The African press has reported on George W. Bush's visit with affection and, in some cases, contrasted his views on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the Democratic candidates'. The Bangkok Post compared the Democrats unfavorably with John McCain and his vision of an East Asia bound together, and to the United States, by expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The backlash could be greatest against Obama because he's raised the highest hopes. A senior Latin American diplomat told me, \"Look, we're all watching Obama with bated breath and hoping [his election] will be a transforming moment for the world. But now that we're listening to him on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>  --  the issue that affects us so deeply  --  we realize that maybe he doesn't wish us well. In fact, we might find ourselves nostalgic for Bush, who is brave and courageous on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and immigration.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact is, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been pivotal in transforming Mexico into a stable democracy with a growing economy. And, in Lawrence Summers's words, it \"didn't cost the United States a penny. It contributed to the strength of our economy because of more exports and because imports helped to reduce inflation.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> among the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries has boomed since 1993, growing by about $700 billion. No serious economists or experts believe that low wages in Mexico, China or India is the fundamental reason American factories close. And labor and environmental standards would do little to change the reality of huge wage differentials between poor and rich countries' workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidates' supporters often argue that they don't really mean what they say, that their proposals on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements involve only minor tinkering. It is an odd defense of candidates promising change, honesty and a new approach to politics to say that they are being cynical and hypocritical. Besides, Obama and Clinton propose renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which is a terrible idea. (And one that has prompted Canada's prime minister to retort that if that happens, his country would like to get more concessions from the United States.) Clinton also has proposed that free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals be reevaluated every five years, which is absurd. The benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals lie in their permanence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both candidates surely know that it is their general attitude and rhetoric, not their policy papers, that matter. On this crucial topic they are pandering to Americans' worst instincts, encouraging a form of xenophobia and chauvinism and validating the utterly self-defeating idea of protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know, I know. This is all about the Democratic primaries in states such as Ohio and about union support. But you can't target messages so easily anymore. What is said in Ohio is heard in Ghana, Bangladesh and Colombia. And isn't the point of leadership to educate and elevate people, not to pander and drag them into the swamp of ignorance and fear? There is a way to speak about the pain of globalization  --  and about the need for investments in retraining, education, health care and infrastructure  --  so that we can compete but also absorb the shocks of a changing economy. Unfortunately, that is not what the Democratic candidates are talking about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm not even sure that protectionist rhetoric works that well in a general election. Americans like optimists. Railing against Mexicans, Chinese and Indians for stealing American jobs smacks of anger, paranoia and fear of the future. Americans want hope, as Obama says, \"hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.\" Where is that courage now?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is editor of Newsweek International and co-host of PostGlobal, an online discussion of international issues.

Replace NAFTA with USMCA.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Donald Trump signed a new agreement to replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a lot of people who depend on borderless commerce \u2014 many of them Midwest exporters of manufactured and agricultural goods \u2014 breathed a sigh of relief. After 15 months of arduous negotiations, the specter of harmful <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers rising on our northern and southern borders was finally gone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So we thought. But a year later, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has yet to come into effect. That\u2019s mainly because the U.S. Congress has yet to approve it. The main inaction is in the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who earlier this month said, \u201cI would like to see it done this year,\u201d has since indicated the House probably won\u2019t stick to that schedule.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Pelosi should use all means at her disposal to see that it does. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., tells us, \u201cI think we have time, and we have bipartisan support.\u201d What is needed, he says, is a recognition by House members that in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, \u201cyou don\u2019t get everything you want.\u201d Compromise is the name of the game.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new accord, also signed by Mexico\u2019s then-President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, doesn\u2019t live up to Trump\u2019s boast of being \u201cthe largest, most significant, modern and balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement in history.\u201d But it would preserve a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone that has boosted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, promoted economic efficiencies and lowered costs for consumers. And the USMCA includes some useful improvements over the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let\u2019s all agree: This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 as if others are. But it\u2019s better than the status quo, and better than any plausible alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting off approval until 2020 would make Democrats complicit in the needless <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> uncertainty that Trump has created.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His tariff policies in particular discourage investment and hiring, and make business planning far more difficult than it should be. Leaving USMCA on the shelf also could provoke the mercurial president to simply abandon <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a step that would create chaos in the North American marketplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American farmers, whose net farm income has plunged by 50% since 2013, have enough trouble lately with bad weather and low prices. They don\u2019t need the additional stress of wondering whether they\u2019ll be able to sell to Mexico and Canada \u2014 which together bought $2.8 billion worth of Illinois\u2019 agricultural goods last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>USMCA also would help Midwest factory workers \u2014 and increase their numbers. The Washington Post reports that: Automakers would face the biggest changes once the new agreement takes effect. The USMCA requires more made-in-the-USA content and mandates that 40% of each vehicle be produced by workers earning $16 per hour \u2014 a provision that is likely to draw jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi\u2019s delay in advancing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal invites Republican criticism that the Democratic-controlled House is too obsessed with impeachment to take care of other matters that have a more direct bearing on the lives of most Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi has insisted that her members \u201ccan walk and chew gum.\u201d But right now it looks as though they are forfeiting an easy achievement in their pursuit of something unattainable \u2014 Trump\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis by the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission, an independent federal agency, concluded that it would stimulate economic growth and job creation across \u201call broad industry sectors within the U.S. economy.\u201d The total yield, by the agency\u2019s calculation: a $68.2 billion increase in gross domestic product and 176,000 additional jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, Trump and Pelosi were sniping at each other: Trump complained to news reporters that the USMCA was \u201csitting on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desk.\u201d The speaker retorted that she\u2019s awaiting some final decisions from Trump\u2019s U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe so. Maybe, too, she could ask one of her staffers to get final answers. Fifteen months after Trump cut this deal, all those Midwest farmers and factory workers aren\u2019t looking for House Democrats\u2019 excuses. They\u2019ve waited too long for a simple action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going into an election year, Democrats can look distracted by impeachment and inattentive to Americans\u2019 economic concerns.

{"id": "419228360.xml", "text": "<h2>OPEN THE BORDER TO MEXICAN TRUCKS</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Seven years ago the U.S and Mexico signed a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that has been beneficial for both countries. But there are problems in making it work, and here's one: If you're a trucker in Mexico, you're not welcome in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the U.S. wants to be true to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, it has to resolve this. But if the U.S. wants to have safe highways, it can't simply give a green light at the border--without making sure Mexican trucks comply with U.S. safety standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are not incompatible goals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration thought they were. It banned Mexican trucks from venturing more than 20 miles beyond the U.S. border, a move that was a clear violation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton team argued a ban was necessary because Mexican trucks were unsafe. Perhaps more significant, however, was pressure from the Teamsters to keep Mexican competition out of the country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Mexican trucks heading for the U.S. haven't been allowed beyond a 20-mile zone north of the U.S. border. In giant lots within this zone, their goods are transferred to American cargo carriers. Mexico has retaliated by blocking open access to its highway network by American trucks, so that laborious transfer of goods takes place for Mexican-bound U.S. carriers too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is cumbersome, time-consuming, needlessly expensive and negates the principle benefit of a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone, namely, unfettered access across borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico appealed to a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> arbitration panel, which has rightly ruled against the U.S. The panel said the U.S. could set whatever safety standards it liked for trucks entering the country, but couldn't simply close the nation to Mexican trucking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bottom line: The U.S. must open its borders to Mexican trucks or face fines of up to $2 billion a year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had U.S. officials--from the beginning--established enforceable safety standards and worked with Mexico and its trucking fleet on meeting those safety standards, this would be a non-issue now. But they didn't, because that would have made the Teamsters unhappy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bush has said he supports open access to Mexican trucks, but he also favors rigorous inspections to protect the public. Precisely how the Bush administration will implement this ruling hasn't yet been determined. But it's about time the U.S. begins-- finally--to comply with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1777580487.xml", "text": "<h2>How Trade Made America Great</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adapted from remarks prepared for the 50th-anniversary reunion of the Yale University class of '66.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During our years at Yale, the world was a different place. Foreign travel was exotic, expensive and rare among the population as a whole. While some young Americans had been abroad, by far most Americans had not -- and those who did go abroad most likely traveled by sea rather than air. In the early 1960s, flying over the oceans was mainly for the affluent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long-distance telephone calls were expensive, international calls prohibitively so. From furniture to TVs and appliances, and especially automobiles, American brands dominated consumer spending in this country. We had just a glimpse of the world to come with the proliferating iconic Volkswagen Beetles and the amazingly small Sony portable transistor radios.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These imported products in the U.S. represented a global political vision that pre-dated World War II. In the early 1930s, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull believed in liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as a path to world peace and cooperation. With strong administration support, Congress in 1934 passed the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement Act, which allowed Hull to negotiate reciprocal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaties with numerous countries, lowering tariffs and stimulating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This liberalization reversed the epitome of U.S. protectionism, the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which contributed to a staggering 66% decline in world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between 1929 and 1934. Integral to Hull's vision was the 1947 General Agreement on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Tariffs (GATT), which was signed by 23 countries and committed the U.S. to steadily liberalizing world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. A central pillar of American postwar policy was enticing producers from around the world with access to the giant U.S. market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The devastation of Europe and Japan and the emergence of Cold War adversaries provided even greater impetus to the opening of American markets, under the protection of the U.S. Navy and the umbrella of various global alliances like NATO. In April 1966 Malcolm McLean launched his first international Sea-Land container operation between New York and Rotterdam. McLean's shipping-container revolution cut the cost of seaborne <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by a factor of 50 versus loose-cargo stevedoring.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That same month, Juan Trippe (Yale '21) at Pan Am ordered 25 revolutionary jumbo 747 widebody Boeing airplanes equipped with equally leading-edge Pratt & Whitney high-bypass fanjets. When the passenger version of the 747 entered service in 1969, it was two-and-a-half times bigger than the Boeing 707 that had pioneered jet travel. The jumbo jet cut overseas travel costs by 70%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 747's hump allowed a freighter version to load cargo through a nose door under the cockpit and into the cavernous fuselage. Because of the cargo-carrying 747F, costs for trans-Pacific airfreight were dramatically reduced, a major factor in the extraordinary GDP growth of the Asian \"tiger\" economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan beginning in the 1970s. Electronics and other high-tech/high-value-added goods from these emerging markets could be distributed and sold in the U.S. and Europe in a few days -- an amazing development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1970s and 1980s, while container ships and planes became increasingly efficient with each successive model, newly developed fiber-optic cables (patented in 1966) began running underseas, connecting the world at the speed of light, lowering voice and data-communication costs by orders of magnitude. Financial markets became globally integrated and transactions multiplied at an astounding rate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. opened its markets to former World War II foes, and Germany and Japan as a result became economic titans. Successive administrations mostly ignored Japan's overt mercantilism and growing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus, given the need for American military bases throughout the country. Eventually exchange rates and domestic political pressure pushed Japanese car makers to set up production plants in the U.S., mostly in the South. Electronics manufacturers such as Panasonic, Sony and Hitachi became world-wide giants on the back of exports from Japan to America and then almost everywhere as global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> steadily expanded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parallel to the technological progress of transportation and telecommunications was a remarkable series of congressional actions and GATT agreements that substantially liberalized transport and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> regulations. During the Carter administration, inspired by extensive academic research and the example of ultra-low-fare intrastate airlines in Texas and California compared with high-cost national carriers, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike pushed for federal economic deregulation of transportation. The Republican mantra was \"free market\"; Democrats sought \"consumer benefit\" by lowering the price of travel and goods for the masses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, legislation was enacted for air cargo (1977), passenger air services (1978), interstate truck and rail transportation (1980), and the federal pre-emption of intrastate trucking in 1994. Both the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the air and surface economic regulators, were abolished, in 1985 and 1995 respectively.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 10 years following the Staggers Act of 1980 that substantially deregulated railroads, the perennially loss-making rail industry was able to halve the rates charged to customers while restoring financial stability. Surface-transport deregulation also spawned an entire new industry of flexible truckload common carriers to meet the needs of emerging \"big box\" distribution and retailing models such as Wal-Mart and Target. Revolutionary production systems, based on just-in-time supply and fast-cycle manufacturing, were made possible only because of the deregulation of trucking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From 1977 to 1994, a century's worth of heavy regulation of transportation rates, routes and services that had begun with the railroads was cast aside, with profound effects on the U.S. economy. By the beginning of the 21st century, overall logistics costs were reduced from 16% of GDP during the 1970s to under 9%, thereby making possible substantial increases in government social spending resulting from the Medicare and Medicaid legislation in the 1960s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the global-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> front, the GATT framework of 1947 had been \"temporary,\" as Congress refused to approve the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization envisioned by the participants at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference that established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Even so, under GATT there were seven successive negotiating \"rounds\" and agreements until the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization (WTO), a modernized International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization, was finally established in Geneva in 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The GATT/WTO did not cover sea <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, given the traditionally liberal rules regarding shipping except within national regulated waters. Thus unimpeded, containership lines of many registrations proliferated, facilitating the astonishing growth in maritime business and the development of megaports in Asia, Europe and the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>International aviation was likewise a separate regime, but as agreed by 54 nations at the Chicago convention of 1944, international flying was for decades tightly controlled by governments through a labyrinth of bilateral treaties (4,000 at present) that limited competition and regulated rates and services.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning in 1992, however, the U.S. and the Netherlands enacted the first of many Open Skies agreements, which have grown now to 117, including a multilateral treaty with 28 European countries. Passenger airlines opened scores of new routes. New air-cargo and door-to-door express services were also initiated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Together, these regulatory changes and transport innovations made possible the fantastic growth of travel and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which grew two-and-a-half times the rate of world GDP for a quarter-century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From less than $50 billion in total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in 1966, the U.S. now imports and exports over $4 trillion annually in goods and services. Container ships have grown from carrying a few hundred boxes on each trip to the new Triple-E behemoths that transport over 18,000 containers called TEUs, or 20-foot-equivalent units. The cost is 1/500th of the shipping rates per pound of the early 1960s. The profusion of agricultural products from the \"Green Revolution\" pioneered by Norman Borlaug, combined with ever more efficient shipping, has resulted in massive amounts of grain <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d around the world, something unimaginable to farmers 50 years ago. American railroads were integral to the growth in the nation's maritime <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by moving containers from Pacific ports to the mega markets in the East.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of these factors have created a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> market that exceeds $15 trillion annually. Now, the Panama Canal is being widened, which will permit, beginning later this year, massive container ships to cross the Pacific and unload directly into improved Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coast ports, further reducing the cost of Asia-U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Handling the enormous increase in financial transactions was made possible by a fantastic increase in computer-processing power. The emergence of the Internet in 1994 has allowed the ubiquitous offering of millions of products for fast delivery from anywhere in the world to anyone with a desktop computer . . . then a PC . . . then a tablet . . . and now a smartphone. Languages are translated; products can be instantly, visually displayed; and orders effortlessly entered. The capabilities are unprecedented in the history of commerce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three other factors central to the development of these enormous global commercial systems have occurred since 1966: The evolution of a vast world-wide oil market; the integration of the economies of the U.S., Mexico and Canada with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) of 1994; and the emergence of China as a great commercial power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The oil cartel known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries overplayed its hand in the 1970s when, for economic and political reasons, OPEC embargoed shipments to the U.S. Market forces finally sorted out oil supply and demand in America after President Reagan in 1981 dismantled the vestiges of government regulation in the industry. Oil has hardly been immune to the vagaries of any commodities market, but the U.S. -- thanks to the technological breakthrough of hydraulic fracturing -- is the world's largest producer of natural gas and is on track this decade to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's largest oil producer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True to the central tenet of FDR and Secretary of State Hull that liberalizing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is inherently beneficial, the U.S. led the effort for China to join the WTO in 2000. Beginning with the Nixon-to-China rapprochement, the industrialization of America's Cold War enemy has lifted more people -- hundreds of millions -- out of poverty, faster, than ever in history. From the late 1980s and accelerating after the WTO accession, efficient Chinese manufacturing, especially technology-based goods, has rewarded Western consumers with low-cost products that have substantially improved standards of living. Americans and Europeans don't need to be affluent to afford cellphones, digital TVs, furniture and appliances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, however, has followed Japan's mercantilistic practices, which have led to a $300 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with the U.S., thanks to state support of Chinese industry and restrictions on foreign competitors. These policies have created a strong political backlash in the U.S., which made the recent congressional renewal of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority -- which allows the president to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaties and was for years a routine process -- extremely difficult.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, given low growth in most of the world, rising wages in China and petroleum costs declining because of U.S. fracking technology, the trajectory of the world's commerce is somewhat uncertain. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and global GDP are now growing roughly at parity. Following the 2008 financial crisis, protectionism has shown a troubling popularity in many countries, including the U.S. Stringent new security regulations have also slowed goods crossing many borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> pact has clearly been an economic success. Over the past 20 years, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and Canada has risen to $1.2 trillion in 2014, from $737 billion. While the immigration issue often gets erroneously conflated with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the economic numbers tell a clear story. Moreover, some production is now moving back to North America from Asia, given lower transport costs, faster delivery, the increase in Chinese production expenses, easier customs clearance, and the more balanced nature of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> compared with the massive U.S. deficit with Asia -- particularly China and Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again, in its own messy, unpredictable political fashion, the U.S. -- after a hiatus during the first Obama administration -- is pushing for further <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization, with initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trans-Atlantic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Investment Partnership, and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in Services Agreement. The WTO likewise continues to push for a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Facilitation Agreement dealing with security and customs issues; the WTO Information Technology Agreement; and a new overall world-wide <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement -- the so-called Doha Round negotiations. These efforts by many nations under the WTO show continued commitment to further global integration despite the well-publicized difficulties in doing so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More than three billion people are now connected to the Internet. Billions more have aspirations for a better life and are likely to come online as global consumers. The odds are good, therefore, that today's remarkable transport systems and technologies will continue to improve and facilitate an even larger global economy as individual <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is becoming almost \"frictionless.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>History shows that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> made easy, affordable and fast -- political obstacles notwithstanding -- always begets more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, more jobs, more prosperity. From clipper ships to the computer age, despite economic cycles, conflict and shifting demographics, humans have demonstrated an innate desire to travel and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Given this, the future is unlikely to diverge from the arc of the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Smith is the chairman and CEO of FedEx Corp.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, Sans Manufactures to Sell, Hurts U.S.\" -- WSJ April 1, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Frederick W.

{"id": "398583454.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Don't let Mexico's woes spoil our commitments to Chile</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deeply involved as we have become in trying to ease the economic crisis in Mexico and limit damage to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, we should not lose sight of the commitment already made to incorporate Chile into the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact in the near future. Given the inability of most members of Congress to distinguish one Latin American country from another, there exists the very real threat that Chile's planned membership -- announced with great fanfare at the Western Hemisphere summit in Miami last month -- will fall victim to the revival of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> detractors and Mexico bashers in Congress and among the public.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For their part, the Chilean government has actively pursued <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> membership for several years, but some Chilean business people and others there think their country is doing quite well without joining <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It would be unfortunate if antagonism or foot-dragging in Washington were to add momentum to that thinking in a country that has previously shown its capacity for patriotic indignation toward gringo silliness. Remember the Great Grape Crisis, when a few tainted Chilean grapes led to a gringo hysteria that almost wiped out a Chilean industry?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Failing to proceed with Chiles membership in a timely fashion would not only be unfortunate for the country that has long been the most qualified for partnership in a free trading relationship with the U.S., but would damage prospects for the gradual development of a hemispheric free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. risks losing at least as much as the South American nations. Countries in South America already are forming overlapping regional alliances within which <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has grown at a staggering rate. Brazil, the giant of the region and with a tradition of independent behavior, has long harbored dreams of organizing the South American economy around itself. So the U.S. could find that by the time it is ready to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> terms with the fast-changing countries of South America, the governments there will have little desire, or need, to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile was, by far, the country in all of Latin America most ready for incorporation into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> at the time Mexico's membership was negotiated. But Chile's distance from the U.S., modest $44 billion economy and population of just 13 million kept it behind the much more populous and problematic country on our border. There were compelling arguments for putting Mexico first, most of them not directly economic. They included Mexico's size, its location, concerns about political instability there, and the immigration issue. Whether or not the new rescue package heads off deep economic dislocation in Mexico and elsewhere, there is still reason to show that economic and political maturity do pay off -- by proceeding with Chile's membership on schedule this year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Membership in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be of more symbolic than real importance to Chile. One study done in Santiago predicted that a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement would produce only small increases in overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the U.S. and Chile, which now exceeds $4 billion and is already strongly positive on the U.S. side. The most obvious benefit to U.S. exporters would be the savings of an estimated $200 million a year in Chilean tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile's membership in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact would amount to an anointment of the almost revolutionary way Chile has turned its economy around in the past decade. Most important, Chile has shown that it is possible to graduate from an \"underdeveloped\" economy to a \"developed\" one in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, Chile is a country with historical and cultural characteristics that set it apart from most other Latin American nations -- a middle-class mind-set (even if not everyone, in fact, is able to live that way) and accompanying respect for education; the relative homogeneity of the population; a level of population growth only slightly higher than ours; a tradition of very little official corruption, and dedicated and capable bureaucrats. But rewarding Chile's accomplishments would throw a spotlight on the discipline and difficult choices that have been required to put Chile where it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has been common in recent weeks to compare Mexico's current crisis with that which swept Chile at the beginning of the 1980s, when Chile was hit by a 90% devaluation of the currency over 12 months, a cutoff of foreign loans, the collapse of international copper prices and the failure of the domestic banking system. What's particularly important to keep in mind is that Chile's government at the time, led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, was seen as one of the pariah regimes of the world, and therefore could not expect international help to extricate itself from a recession more intense in relative terms than the Great Depression was in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these strikes against it, within a few years Chile laid the foundation for the healthy, aggressive trading nation we know today. Some of Chile's best minds pioneered many unique market-oriented mechanisms to restructure the economy, such as the debt-equity swaps that allowed the country to get on top of its massive foreign debt and that have been copied in many other countries. Sweeping deregulations and tax cuts and simplifications eased market entry for thousands of small and mid-size firms, which broadened Chile's economic base. And a low, uniform tariff ensured that no industry would be singled out as \"strategic,\" and therefore deserving of special protections from international competition. These efforts lowered the cost of production and sharpened Chile's competitive edge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the political side, the crisis had the effect of emboldening and energizing the political opposition to Gen. Pinochet, which was able to overturn his rule at the ballot box. That same opposition had the good sense to warmly embrace the good things accomplished under Gen. Pinochet's rule while abandoning his political authoritarianism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time freely elected leaders took office in early 1990, the hard-won economic recovery had become a source of pride for almost all Chileans. Indeed, the change from military to civilian rule was one of the smoothest in history. And the economy suffered fewer jolts than a change between Democrats and Republicans produces in the U.S. If ever a country has deserved recognition for turning a disastrous situation around without any bailouts, it's Chile. From time to time, it wouldn't be so bad to reward those who take full responsibility and do the right thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Christian, formerly a newspaper and wire correspondent in Latin America, owns a book publishing house in the Kansas City area and is editing a business guide to Latin America.</p>\n"}

In the perception of some Americans, including a significant number of Democrats, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a cautionary tale, invoked today as a warning that similar deals will harm the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is unfortunate on two counts. First, comparing the substance of current negotiations to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, an agreement reached at the end of the Cold War and the dawn of globalization, is like comparing the latest smartphone to an early Macintosh desktop. The 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement being hammered out by the administration is more sophisticated, comprehensive and user-friendly than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was in its day. It would also connect the United States to a much larger global network. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Michael Froman is negotiating a state-of-the-art agreement, and Obama has advanced persuasive arguments for both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority he needs to seal the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s legacy is more positive and instructive than its ardent critics recognize. Reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to a caricature obscures both its achievements and some valuable lessons -- good and bad. As part of the White House team that helped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> become a reality, I think its record over the past 20 years can contribute to the current debate and to larger questions about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the United States's role in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which was negotiated under President George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, united the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Today, Canada is our largest export market and Mexico is the second largest. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in North America has increased by 400 percent, passing $1.1 trillion per year. More U.S. exports go to Mexico than to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain combined. We export more to Canada than to the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The successes went well beyond the balance sheet, however. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted U.S. security and regional stability. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is a powerful instrument of geopolitics, binding us to our allies. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> smoothed more than a century of friction in U.S.-Mexico relations. It was a catalyst for opening Mexico's economy and its political system; within a decade, the country ended generations of one-party rule. Mexico is today undertaking reforms that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. The success of a North American platform in energy and manufacturing has yielded diplomatic and security cooperation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> cemented ties with our neighbors and showed that the United States would not turn inward after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Trans-Pacific Partnership can be an essential bonding agent in our relations in Asia. It is a crucial sign of our engagement with a region where China seeks to assert more influence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sharpest criticism of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that it caused U.S. job losses and lower wages, a concern painfully reflected in the hardship of workers who saw jobs go overseas. The rise of the global economy, advances in technology and other factors have transformed the American workplace. How big was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s role? Economists disagree. Assessing its overall economic impact, a report last month by the Congressional Research Service issued a split decision: \"In reality, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, despite significant growth, does remain a relatively small part of the total U.S. economy. Still, evidence suggests net job creation and more high-wage jobs created in the process. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, around 14 million U.S. jobs depend on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, with nearly 5 million of those jobs due to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> increase generated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disruptive power of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a reality we can't ignore. It brings benefits and costs. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> helps keep inflation and consumer prices low. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted productivity through competition. On jobs, the lessons of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argue for a holistic approach to education and training assistance for employees along with infrastructure and other investment. The profits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must flow not only to shareholders but also to workers. Notably, agreements in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on labor and the environment were handled in \"side letters\" drafted after negotiations. Now, they are being baked into the deal-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a rare bipartisan triumph. Congress approved the measure with a Republican majority and more than 100 Democratic votes after exhaustive persuasion by Clinton. \"It's never fun passing a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill in this town,\" Obama said last week. But it is a critical test of leadership for both the president and the country. As in 1993, bipartisan support is needed not just to muster enough votes. It sends a clear message that the United States will not turn inward from the realities of the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements are a long-term wager on the future. That's a good reason to exorcise the ghosts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It did not invent the forces of globalization; it shaped them in the interests of the United States. The Trans-Pacific Partnership can continue that work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Thomas F. McLarty III</p>\n"}
{"id": "398589640.xml", "text": "<h2>President Farley</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Washington is weird, as everyone knows. But sometimes it's so strange it surprises even us. Consider how a policy favored by everyone from President Clinton to Newt Gingrich to Bill Archer to Charlie Rangel just got axed from the great budget \"compromise.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not long ago we wrote about the furious behind-the-scenes lobbying effort by Fruit of the Loom, the underwear maker, to kill a proposal to extend <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefits to the nearly 30 countries of the Caribbean. Many of these countries, as vacationing Americans well know, are dirt poor, and the effort to help them was begun by Ronald Reagan. Now with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> reducing tariffs for Mexico's exports to the U.S., these countries automatically were put at a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disadvantage. The idea was to level the playing field for Americas' poorest players.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, Fruit of the Loom won. The proposal died. It's not too much to say that Fruit CEO William Farley showed he's the most important <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not that he didn't have help. An assist goes to the Republican Senate, especially Senate Finance Chairman William Roth of Delaware. Mr. Roth fancies himself a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, and he did vote for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But in this case he behaved more like a parochial horse <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r. His spokeswoman says the senator heard from about 30 senators who wanted to kill or minimize Caribbean parity, which would merely extend to these poor countries in America's backyard the lower tariffs and higher import quotas that now apply to Mexico. Apparently Mr. Roth wilted under this not-so-intense pressure, because he refused to include the provision that had passed the House in the final GOP bill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Mr. Clinton personally telephoned on the matter, Mr. Roth decided to set a price on his cooperation. He said that if the president wanted Caribbean parity so much, he would have to agree to a reform of Amtrak that would alter costly union rules. This reform would have allowed more federal cash to flow to Amtrak, which just happens to run between Delaware and the Beltway. Mr. Clinton, not wanting to irritate the AFL-CIO or Al Gore (who has become labor honcho John Sweeney's bosom buddy), declined. So Mr. Roth let the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiative die. How's that for a triumph of statesmanship?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One other debit line: Former Senator Bob Dole deserves mention for enlisting his new Beltway law firm on behalf of the anti-parity forces. Mr. Dole used to favor Caribbean parity. But his former <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> aide, Robert Lighthizer, now lobbies for Fruit. And another of Mr. Dole's former <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> aides now works for his successor as majority leader, Trent Lott, who also seemed curiously indifferent to helping countries like Haiti and the Dominican Republic help themselves. We wish these men who think they should be president would explain why they'd rather have these countries export desperate immigrants to the U.S. rather than products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this might just be morally embarrassing to American foreign policy if it didn't auger so poorly for the big debate over free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiating authority that is coming this autumn. Mr. Clinton says this is one of his big priorities. But he'll have to show a greater willingness to take on Big Labor than he did over assisting the Caribbean. As for Republicans, they have to decide if they're going to stand for the most narrow special interests imaginable or something bigger. What's good for Bill Farley or Bill Roth isn't always good for the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Textiles\" -- WSJ Aug. 21, 1997)</p>\n"}
{"id": "1681400706.xml", "text": "<h2>Free Trade Is Not the Enemy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CORRECTION APPENDED. CHICAGO -- IN 1993, President Bill Clinton tapped me as special counsel to lead the fight to pass the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. As a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate rages in Washington, I've thought a lot about that effort. The mistake we made in the 1990s was overestimating the potential of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s positive impact. Today, we are making the mistake of underestimating what defeat of the Asia-Pacific deal would mean economically, globally and politically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, America was on the precipice of great change. In plain view was the collapse of the Soviet empire, the further liberalization of China's economy and the intensification of international efforts to integrate economies worldwide. On the horizon was a technological revolution to rival any we had known. In 1993, the Internet was made up of just 130 websites. President Clinton, who felt that a party that embraced the future would always win out over one that shrank from it, firmly believed that adopting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was in the best interest of the nation, the middle class and the Democratic Party. So we muscled the agreement through Congress over fierce Democratic opposition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic impact of the deal was immediately undercut by the collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994. But opponents' predictions of \"a giant sucking sound\" accompanying the departure of millions of jobs from American workers never materialized, either. From <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s ratification through the end of President Clinton's final year in 2000, America added over 20 million jobs, including more than 300,000 in manufacturing. When the manufacturing decline began in earnest in 2001, the main culprits were the offshoring of jobs to China, with which we have no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, and automation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Congress is set to weigh in on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which encompasses 12 nations on four continents and dwarfs <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in economic size and geopolitical importance. Once again, the debate takes place while we are in the midst of great change -- a prolonged period of slow economic growth in the United States, China's re-emergence as a regional power, and a new economic order in which the developing countries of the world produce more goods and services than North America, Europe and Japan combined. Many on the political left and right oppose the liberalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, just as they did during the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, arguing instead for protectionist measures. But they're off-base.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no path to middle-class prosperity without tearing down barriers to American exports. By 2030, the world economy is expected to grow by $60 trillion, with almost 90 percent of the growth occurring outside the United States. Our success depends on how much of that new wealth is spent on American products. But today, of the 40 largest economies, the United States ranks 39th in the share of our gross domestic product that comes from exports. This is because our products face very high barriers to entry overseas in the form of tariffs, quotas and outright discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When barriers disappear, we prosper. In the 17 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals the United States has concluded since 2000, our balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the blue-collar-goods sector went from minus $3 billion to plus $31 billion, according to an analysis of government data by the centrist policy institute Third Way, on whose board I sit. According to the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Administration, export-related jobs pay 18 percent more than similar jobs in the same sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Geopolitically, President Obama is also right. If we don't set the rules for commerce in the Asia-Pacific region, China will. Since 2000, China has concluded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with 23 countries, Hong Kong and Macau and is now drafting its own Asia <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that cuts us out. This deal apparently omits any mention of labor rights and environmental standards common in modern American-led deals. It would keep many of the region's economies relying on the same substandard factory floor conditions that China and other Asian nations used to become manufacturing giants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the TPP passes, the poorer countries in the pact will have to conform more to the standards of the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada -- all signatories to the proposed deal. The need for the China-led agreement disappears, and China's economic fortunes will be tied to joining our alliance, which would necessitate raising its standards on labor conditions, the environment and the rule of law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, there is the question of politics. Denying the president the authority to negotiate an agreement to bring before Congress would be a serious rebuke. With much of the opposition coming from his own party, it would tell the nation that Democrats had lost confidence in the economic leadership of the man who steered us out of a near-depression. In effect, Mr. Obama's own party would be stripping him of the same ability to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that every president since F.D.R., except for Richard M. Nixon, has enjoyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s shadow hangs over this deal, but the truth is that both its upside and its downside are smaller than anyone likes to admit. Now we have a chance to guide a huge section of the world's economy to reflect our own high standards for commerce. Why would we deny the president the opportunity to seize this moment?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction:  May 21, 2015, Thursday</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Tuesday incorrectly described South Korea's involvement with the Trans-Pacific Partnership; it is not a signatory to the proposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WILLIAM M.

{"id": "398607328.xml", "text": "<h2>Free Trade Won't Kill Social Programs</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has been clear since the acrimonious 1993 debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area that our country's politics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy are changing in a fundamental and dangerous way. Joining self-interested parties like U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions in their opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been apparently well-meaning social groups that erroneously view imports as a threat to their favored social programs, from welfare to environmental protection. The new protectionist social-policy coalition lost the debates over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and then the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. But it recently scored a huge victory by helping derail President Clinton's request for \"fast track\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiating authority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the fierce opposition of social-policy advocates to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> doesn't stand up to rational analysis. Many U.S. environmentalists, for example, claimed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would undermine U.S. environmental standards. \"The truth about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" wrote ex-California Gov. Jerry Brown, \"is that it will create a race to the bottom in environmental standards. This is inevitable if we rashly link ourselves to Mexico, where environmental laws are unenforced.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect four years now, and the predicted \"race to the bottom\" in environmental standards has not materialized. The sole environmental effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been that some -- not many -- high-polluting firms have left the U.S. Furniture finishers in central Los Angeles, for instance, moved their plants to Mexico, where they could use more effective but also more toxic furniture sprays.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such relocation shifts the production of pollution inside <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> from a nation where the marginal social cost of pollution is relatively high (as implied by the relatively high U.S. environmental standard) to one where it is lower. Thus even though Mexico loses from more pollution, and the U.S. gains from less pollution, the gain to the U.S. must be greater than the loss to Mexico because of the differences in the two countries' marginal social costs of pollution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An arithmetic example illustrates this point. Assume the marginal, or extra, social cost from an additional unit of pollution is $6 in the U.S., and $3 in Mexico. When the production of one unit of pollution is transferred from the U.S. to Mexico, the U.S. thus gains $6 while Mexico loses $3. This represents a net gain of $3 for the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area as a whole. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> causes a more rational -- i.e. less costly -- distribution of pollution inside the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area, not an adjustment in environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experience with the U.S.-Canadian free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement shows free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> also is compatible with different national welfare objectives. The agreement was opposed by Canadian social democrats who feared free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the U.S. would undermine generous Canadian social welfare programs. \"[New Democratic Party] leader Edward Broadbent says his rejection of the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact is motivated less by its actual terms than by his fear that there will inevitably be capitalist pressure on social programs under it,\" reported Toronto's Globe & Mail in 1988. \"Mr. Broadbent told reporters, `I have an immense fear that if the agreement is put in place, corporate pressures would mount to harmonize Canadian social policies, such as subsidized Medicare and pensions, with lower American standards.'\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Broadbent's fears proved groundless, however. The U.S.-Canadian free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement has been in place for almost 10 years and Canadian welfare policy continues to be significantly more generous than America's. One reason: The Canadian dollar fell relative to the U.S. dollar to adjust for the higher social charges Canada imposes on its goods. Canada's depreciated currency made U.S. goods more expensive in the Canadian market and, by doing so, prevented the feared explosion of U.S. imports into Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not only should America's new protectionists look to the Canadian experience for guidance, but to that of the Northern European welfare states as well. In Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, social welfare programs literally exploded during the 1950s and '60s. At the same time, these small European welfare states all followed free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. The $64,000 question: If free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> undermines social welfare programs, as new protectionists fear, why did social democracy flourish in those free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> countries during this 20-year period? The argument that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is damaging to social welfare programs is refuted both by rational analysis and historical experience.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Notwithstanding this fact, the danger posed by the new protectionist coalition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> should not be discounted. By identifying <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection with protection of the environment, Naderesque consumer rights, human rights and social welfare benefits, protectionists are gaining an undeserved moral high ground in their battle with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs. Enemies of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> understand the popularity of these social causes and have been clever to attach <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protectionism to them -- not only by forming political coalitions with these social groups but by adopting their language and style. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> unions pursuing their protectionist objectives, for example, pretend they are attempting to stave off a \"race to the bottom\" in labor standards, when in fact they're trying to boost U.S. wages to noncompetitive levels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enemies of the welfare state, on the other hand, do free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> no favor when they also argue that the welfare state is incompatible with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. For if the public must choose between popular social causes on the one hand and a somewhat arcane, poorly understood and much maligned free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy on the other, the outcome may not be a happy one for the followers of Adam Smith.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One lesson from President Clinton's defeat on fast track is clear: Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs must delink <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection from social causes, whatever their merits.

{"id": "398600482.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: In the debate about Nafta, just the facts please</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has passed its third anniversary and so, according to its original enabling legislation, the Clinton administration must deliver a status report to Congress by July 1. The sensational trashing of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> by its opponents has not let up during its first three years and this mandatory report will bring the effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> back under the spotlight of domestic politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the potential for an expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> still alive, the report is also likely to be used in the continuing debate on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Here's a look at some of the most common concerns that the report is likely to address and a look at the facts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs because businesses preferred to shift labor costs to Mexico where workers can be paid less.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. The U.S. has created more than two and a half million jobs a year since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect and current U.S. unemployment, at 4.9%, is full employment by any reasonable calculation. The U.S. economy as a whole can't be losing jobs if it is at full employment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. OK, but the new U.S. jobs are menial, poorly paying jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. To cite the 1997 report of the Council of Economic Advisors: \"Most of the new positions created in the 1990s are good jobs,\" by which they mean jobs in manufacturing and higher paying services, not just hamburger flipping. Protectionists generally fail to point out that salaries in export industries pay some 13% more than those in manufacturing generally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. When jobs are lost, individuals and families have little to fall back on because of the \"inadequacy of adjustment assistance\" -- retraining and financial help in seeking new employment -- provided in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> legislation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. In the entire period of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s existence, the Department of Labor has certified some 125,000 people as being adversely affected by U.S. investment in, and imports from, Canada and Mexico. This number is about equal to the number of new jobs created in the U.S. every two weeks. About 10,000 of those who were certified took advantage of the benefits in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> legislation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. It is undeniable that the U.S. bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico last year was $15 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. The significance of the argument is unclear. Mexico, in 1995, went through a deep depression. Gross domestic product fell by almost 7% and, under these circumstances, its imports inevitably declined and its exports increased because the domestic market collapsed. The single most important determinant of the annual <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance between Mexico and the U.S. is the relative state of the two economies. This is evident in the accompanying graph, which shows how closely U.S. exports to Mexico track that country's economic growth: U.S. exports to Mexico started their upward movement again in 1996 when the Mexican economy resumed its growth. This year, Mexico is likely to become the second largest U.S. export market, after Canada, overtaking Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. But the extra imports from Mexico must have led to a loss of U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. How could they, if the U.S. was at full employment? What the extra imports did was increase the choice for U.S. consumers and producers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. The Mexican economy collapsed in 1995 because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. Mexico's economy was done in by a combination of two main developments: a series of political tragedies, including the assassination of the main presidential candidate, and a mismanaged monetary policy. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> contains nothing in its text about exchange-rate issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. Mexico deliberately rigged its industrial policy to attract foreign investment in order to become a platform for export to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. Had Mexico wished to be a platform for shipment to the U.S., it would have undervalued the peso to stimulate exports. It did the opposite because priority was given to reducing inflation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. When Mexico realized that its exchange rate was overvalued, it rigged a devaluation in order to stimulate exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. It is outrageous to assert that the Mexican authorities deliberately put the country through its worst economic tragedy since the Great Depression, and in the process ended the political monopoly of the ruling party, in order to arrange a temporary improvement in its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. Real wages in Mexico have declined because export expansion demands this outcome.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. Mexico's real wages did decline in 1995 because it went through a catastrophic year economically. Unemployment also rose. Mexico's economy grew by more than 5% in 1996 and employment and wages also rose. The economy continues to expand in 1997.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> limited Mexico's economic options in 1995, thereby making the depression worse than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did require that Mexico deal with its problems by overall macroeconomic measures and not by restrictions on imports from the U.S. The result was recovery in a single year, compared with the four years it took after the economic downturn in 1982, when the main medicine was import restrictions and capital controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. The U.S. had to lend Mexico $20 billion at the beginning of 1995 to rescue the peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. Yes, it did, and other lines of credit coming to a potential total of more than $50 billion were authorized. Early this year, Mexico repaid, with interest, all the money it drew down under the U.S. line of credit, and is on schedule in repayments of other credits. Most of the potential $50 billion never was used. Mexico was able to borrow in world money markets within six months of its collapse in early 1995, whereas it took more than six years after 1982 when the recovery policy was based on import and capital restrictions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Argument. Whatever its economic policies, Mexico is not a democracy and the U.S. therefore should not participate with it in a comprehensive free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Facts. This argument comes at precisely the moment that Mexico is moving to legitimate democracy under which opposition parties regularly win elections and may take over the government of Mexico City, the largest jurisdiction in the country, in July. A more open Mexican economy has helped open its political system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Weintraub is an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</p>\n"}

{"id": "398909273.xml", "text": "<h2>North America the Beautiful</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United States meet for a summit in Texas today, they will represent countries that together face growing challenges to their economic competitiveness and security. In the 12 years since the landmark North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was signed, much has changed. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> revolutionized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in North America, helping to unlock our region's economic potential. But meanwhile, China and India have become increasingly integrated into the global market, the European Union has expanded to 25 nations, and terrorist and criminal activity have underscored North America's vulnerability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Deepening the integration of our three countries promises great benefits for our citizens. But as the September 11 attacks showed, integration is neither inevitable nor irreversible. We cannot afford to stand still or to take one another for granted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To make North America more competitive and secure, the three leaders should announce a plan to establish a North American security and economic community by 2010. The aim of this community would be to guarantee a free, safe, just and prosperous North America. The boundaries of the community would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter, within which the movement of people and products would be legal, orderly and secure. To meet these objectives, three broad challenges must be addressed:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first challenge is security, a precondition for growing our economies. We learned after September 11 that without effective security cooperation among our three countries, our commercial relationships suffer and our freedoms and quality of life are affected. The three leaders meeting in Texas should set the goal to establish a common security perimeter for North America that would give a terrorist trying to penetrate our borders an equally hard time no matter which country he tried to enter first. This would require far-reaching changes in our border patrol, including harmonizing visa and asylum regulations, synchronizing entry and exit screening and tracking procedures, fully sharing data on the exit and entry of foreign nationals, and jointly inspecting container traffic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our second major shared challenge is our regional economic competitiveness. Over the last decade, the pace of economic integration within North America has outstripped the capacity of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> framework, even as global competitive pressures have grown. Our three governments need to remove restraints on our ability to compete, including adopting a common external tariff and entering into negotiations to find a joint approach to unfair and anti-competitive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices -- like dumping -- which have had a toxic effect on our relations. We also need to make travel within North America easier and more secure. A North American Border Pass with biometric identifiers would speed travel within our region so that border officials can focus on genuine threats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our third challenge is to address the disparities in economic development within North America, which threaten us all. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and investment flows on the continent have increased dramatically, but the development gap between Mexico and its two northern neighbors has widened. Low wages and lack of economic opportunity in parts of Mexico stimulate undocumented immigration, and contribute to human suffering that can sometimes translate into violence. Mexico must take steps to attract investment and accelerate growth. At the same time, the U.S. and Canada, as a matter of their own national interest, should assist by establishing a North American Investment Fund to create infrastructure linking the poorer parts of Mexico to the markets of the north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To meet these challenges, we need regular summit meetings like this month's gathering in Texas. There is no better way to demonstrate to our citizens the importance of our continental partnership than to have the American and Mexican presidents and the Canadian prime minister meet at least annually to discuss major issues, agree on shared priorities and provide energy and momentum to the North American agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is time to get serious about North America. Today's summit in Texas is the place to start.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Manley is the former Canadian deputy prime minister and finance minister.
