Accord may ultimately bring real democracy to that nation.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nov. 2 was the Day of the Dead in Mexico, a celebration of life and its tragicomic interrelationship with death. There's a special bread that's baked for the occasion, pan de muertos, in the shape of a skull and bones, a special bright yellow flower laid on graves, cempasuchitl, and short, usually funny, poems written and recited, called calaveras.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nowhere among the multitude of graves spread across this big country was there even one this year marked \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" so I am told, though it can hardly be said that the Mexican populace is happy in the aftermath of the country's worst economic crisis since 1982. In fact, in a recent poll conducted in Mexico City, 79% of the respondents said Mexico is on the wrong economic track. While not specifically targeted in the questioning, no doubt, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement played a part in that rather overwhelming negative view.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't do too well on this side of the border either. In a Times poll conducted last year, people were split on the question of whether <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good or bad for the United States. Were I to have been asked at the time, I would have voted with those who opted for \"mixed,\" for the following reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the agreement has been in effect only three years. Its implementation is phased over 15 years. Second, other events have confounded the picture, in particular, the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994, the severe recession that followed and continuing issues with Mexico's transition to real democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to Mexico took a nose dive in 1995 as a result, but rebounded in 1996 and are on the same growth now as they were pre-devaluation. U.S. imports from Mexico currently are running about $10 billion ahead of exports, about the same <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gap that existed in 1995 and 1996. Textile/apparel imports, in particular, are surging at unprecedented rates of increase. Mexico is fast replacing Asia as America's tailor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Interestingly and perhaps ironically, the apparel industry in Orange County also grew substantially over the past five years. This parallel development is supported by immigrant labor (not necessarily all from Mexico) earning the U.S. minimum wage and exists despite the lure of lower labor costs in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to forget Ross Perot's powerful metaphor of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the \"giant sucking sound.\" Claims of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> range as high as 400,000 (Teamster's Union), whereas job gains from increased U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada are estimated at slightly more than 300,000 (President's Report). The truth is that both are probably overstatements and that the overall net U.S. employment effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been slightly positive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Orange County, employment levels in those industrial sectors mentioned with regard to export growth into Mexico have actually declined. For example, from 1992 to 1996, employment declined 18.9% in aircraft parts. In computing and office equipment, the decline was somewhat larger, at 23%. But average payrolls were growing faster, at 28.1% and 42.4%, respectively, signaling an overall net improvement in these sectors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even during 1993, when the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate was at its apex, the most astute observers were commenting that, rather than being a radical departure, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was most significantly a formalization and extension of tariff and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization policies toward the U.S. that had begun earlier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>High rates of export growth to Mexico have been the norm for Orange County businesses over the past few years too, with annual growth rates averaging 25%. From UCI's 1997 Orange County Executive Survey, 26.8% of Orange County businesses involved in international sales and/or operations were doing business in Mexico, with 8.6% more planning to enter the Mexican market soon. In 1996, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the county's second most important export destination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Probably the most accurate overall conclusion about the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to date is that it has helped Mexico and Canada without really hurting the U.S. In addition, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not just about economics, particularly where Mexico is concerned. Mexico has a long way to go politically. It is hoped that democracy and a more export-oriented economy will begin to supplant corruption as the glue that holds Mexico together. The end result should be the strengthening and expansion of the middle class. But that is likely to take a long time, and the transition will undoubtedly have some rough spots along the way.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, patience is indeed going to be a virtue where Mexico and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are concerned. Let's not lay cempasuchitl on the grave of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> quite yet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: DENNIS AIGNER; ID NUMBER: 19980111ome0252; GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (no caption); ID NUMBER: 19980111ome0253</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Dennis J.

The peso has fallen to an all-time low of more than 20 to the dollar, and on Thursday the Bank of Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate to stem the bleeding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico investors are worried that Mr. Trump might actually believe--as he argued in his campaign--that U.S. productivity growth and job creation depend on renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to discourage U.S. investments south of the border. But Mexico won't easily yield to a new deal that limits its access to U.S. markets in order to make it less attractive as a destination for capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump counters with tariff hikes in violation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico is likely to respond with its own duty increases. It did this with $2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. export products in 2009 when the U.S. failed to live up to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligation in trucking. There is even the possibility that Mr. Trump will carry out his threat to tear up the agreement. There are no winners in any of these narratives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 23 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was launched, Mexico has cultivated a middle-class, a more-vibrant democracy and a diversified economy far less dependent than it once was on oil. The country now sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would be an economic disaster and open the door to political instability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus it won't be so easy for Mr. Trump to bully the neighbors. National pride will play a role in stiffening the Mexican spine, and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's government is signaling that it intends to face any crisis by deepening structural reforms, getting its fiscal house in order and looking more aggressively for new trading partners. The unspoken message to Mr. Trump is that if he plays the protectionist game, Mexico is ready to raise the stakes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s demise would be bad for the U.S. too, although the U.S. stock market rally suggests that the fear of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war is overblown. Protectionist steel and textile tycoon Wilbur Ross is rumored to be in line for a job in the new administration. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r from Indiana, which in 2015 exported $4.8 billion in goods to Mexico, its second-largest export market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time Mr. Trump has had flashes of sanity on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In a joint press conference with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in August, then-candidate Trump spoke of the need to \"keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some expect the Trump administration to find a way to largely leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone while it works on legitimate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues like China's practice of intellectual-property theft. Mexico seems to want to help in this face-saving endeavor and has wisely decided not to escalate the rhetoric. It doesn't need to: Americans have plenty to lose if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many U.S. corporations are now heavily invested in supply chains that crisscross the continent to create globally competitive products. These support millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Saying goodbye to duty-free access to Mexico under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also would hit U.S. agricultural exports hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters on Nov. 10 that his government is \"ready to talk so we can explain the strategic importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for the region. Here we're not talking about . . . renegotiating it, we're simply talking about dialogue.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also said Mexico will look for new markets, adding to more than 40 existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. It had hoped for expanded opportunities via the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that includes the U.S. and much of Asia. But President Obama wasn't able to get TPP through Congress and Mr. Trump has promised to kill it. Mr. Guajardo said that Mexico will pursue the possibility of completing a smaller TPP with the countries that are expected to have ratified it by the end of 2016. He named Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Australia would probably be eager to replace the U.S. as Mexico's chief food supplier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this would make up for the loss of U.S. market access under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which means that increasing Mexican competitiveness is urgent. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto got historic constitutional reforms in energy and telecommunications through his Congress in 2013. Opening these markets to competition will attract capital and improve the infrastructure for producers but implementation takes time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately the government's debt burden has increased sharply in recent years and taxes have gone up, adding to disappointing economic performance. These are mistakes that Mexican policy makers cannot afford if Mr. Trump plays chicken with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "1926409772.xml", "text": "<h2>Let's make a deal</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE TRANSCRIPT of President Trump's Jan. 27 phone conversation with President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico made fascinating reading - especially in light of what has actually happened among the United States, Mexico and their North American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partner, Canada, since the call. It's not a good-news story, but it is a could-have-been-worse story. Instead of slapping tariffs on Mexican goods, as he threatened during both the 2016 campaign and the chat with Mr. Pena Nieto, Mr. Trump agreed to talks, the goal of which is to update the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, not scrap it, as he has also threatened from time to time. What's more, the parties have set an expedited negotiation schedule, with the first meeting slated for Aug. 16 in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The specific negotiating objectives the Trump administration set forth in a July 17 report to Congress were in many respects necessary and proper. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is basically working as designed, but any quarter-century-old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact could use modification to account for new realities. It's reasonable, for example, to seek new understanding on digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in goods and services and on cross-border data flows, as the Trump objectives propose. Veterans of negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump reviled, noted similarities between the approach sketched in the July 17 paper and what had been accomplished in the TPP talks. But if hypocrisy, or reinventing the wheel, is the worst sin Mr. Trump commits on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the world will breathe a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alas, the administration also specified that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and the (smaller) one with Canada be reduced as a result of the talks, which isn't possible and wouldn't necessarily be desirable even if it were. Possibly even more counterproductive, Mr. Trump's goals include the elimination of the so-called Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which creates a special <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-based forum to challenge a member country's claims that another is selling exports below cost (\"dumping\"). This check against potentially protectionist litigation brought by U.S. industries in U.S. forums was Canada's precondition for joining the U.S.-Canada free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, upon which <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was built; and it's one reason that exports from Canada and Mexico are far less likely than those of other nations to face penalties in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eliminating Chapter 19 probably would be a dealbreaker for Canada. And why would Mr. Trump seeks its elimination? After all, as he said in that call with Mr. Pena Nieto, \"Canada is no problem . . . we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair.\" Perhaps he means the proposal as a bargaining chip, to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d for some other, more valuable concession. Or perhaps he will be willing to finesse it behind closed doors, just as he pleaded with Mr. Pena Nieto to help him wiggle out of his unwise promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall. We certainly hope the administration can be pragmatic on this point, lest it trigger the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with our neighbors that Mr. Trump once promised but so far has sidestepped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

An already shaky economic situation was made more unstable Jan. 1 when the Mexican government suddenly deregulated gasoline prices. Gas prices rose as much as 20%, triggering angry demonstrations across the country.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent weeks, Trump has acknowledged that it is unlikely the U.S. would receive a direct payment from Mexico, whose economy has been plagued by slow growth and rising inflation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Probably less likely that it's a payment,\" he added.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could the U.S. try to recoup the costs?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way is taxing remittances, an idea Trump has floated in the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015, Mexico received nearly $25 billion in remittances from citizens living outside the country, most of them from the U.S., according to the Bank of Mexico, the country's central banking system. Trump has suggested much of that money is sent from people who are living in the United States illegally, although according to PolitiFact, there is no way to track the legal status of remittance senders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Trump pushed Congress to approve, say, a 10% tax on remittances, that could generate $10 billion dollars for the U.S. government over four years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump could \"slice and dice\" the situation to make it appear that Mexico is paying a tax to fund a border wall, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow specializing in U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. But ultimately, it would be Mexican immigrants who were paying.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's an ugly and regressive tax, because you're essentially taxing poor people,\" Alden said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is there a precedent for taxing remittances?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, at least on the state level. Since 2009, Oklahoma has charged a 1% fee -- critics call it a tax -- on all personal wire transfers of cash to accounts outside the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fee is a withholding on state income tax, and when residents file taxes, they get the money back.

If that happens, \"the U.S. runs the risk of going into recession.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The consequences for Mexico also could be devastating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico would almost certainly go into recession too,\" Coutino said, because Mexico's faltering economy would limit officials' ability to lower interest rates and pump money into the economy like U.S. leaders did during the Great Recession.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A recession in Mexico, Coutino said, could unleash major unintended consequences in the U.S. that could ultimately undermine Trump's efforts to even the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> playing field and limit illegal immigration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"In indirectly inducing the weakening of the peso, Trump is making Mexican exports more attractive for American consumers,\" Coutino said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If you block Mexico in terms of exports, investing and remittances, Mexico's economy is going to sink, unemployment is going to rise, and guess what?

Though Central Americans have been trying to reach the U.S. in greater numbers, net migration from Mexico has remained zero for several years, with U.S. and Mexican government data showing more people returning to Mexico than entering the U.S. illegally each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What can Mexico do about Trump's plans?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has little say in several of the changes Trump has proposed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is nothing Mexico could do to block a tax on remittances. And although it could impose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tariffs on imports from the U.S., that would not have a big effect because Mexico exports more than it imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Wednesday, Pena Nieto suggested that if Trump tries to punish Mexico on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or other fronts, Mexico may push back by leveraging its cooperation with the U.S. on crucial issues such as immigration and security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years, Mexico has stepped up enforcement efforts along its southern border to help the U.S. slow immigration from Central America and other parts of the world. Between October 2014 and May 2015, for example, Mexican authorities detained more Central American migrants than the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Mexico and the U.S. collaborate closely on security issues, from intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies to the Merida Initiative, a partnership forged in 2007 to help reduce the power of drug trafficking in Mexico. Since then, the U.S. has contributed more than $2 billion to Mexico in police training and cash for better security equipment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the effectiveness of using security and immigration as bargaining chips is questionable, experts say, in part because U.S. funding for those efforts is also in Mexico's interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That leaves Mexico, Coutino said, \"basically at the mercy of the U.S.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The most likely scenario is that the Trump administration will find some way to claim that they have forced Mexico to pay for the additional border fencing,\" Wilson said. \"And Mexico will claim that it was paid for by Congress and the Trump administration.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kate.linthicum@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>kurtis.lee@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Linthicum reported from Mexico City and Lee from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: A BORDER FENCE separates Tecate, Calif., left, and Tecate, Mexico.

Beyond China, the Trump administration is expected to advance by February a plan for new tariffs on the Japanese and European auto industries. And in an important political test for the president, the Trump administration will have to work with the newly elected Democratic majority in the House to gain congressional approval of the proposed new North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In each case the outcome will shape the Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> legacy -- and the bottom line of practically any company with a significant international supply chain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump on Saturday agreed not to raise tariffs on $200 billion a year of imports from China to 25% from 10% in January, part of a truce in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict with China. Yet those levies could be back on the table as early as March, depending on the outcome of talks. And even the lower tariffs are already affecting supply chains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Business lobbyists say the administration would face a political backlash from consumers if it adds hundreds of billions of dollars more of imports from China to its tariffs list</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it isn't entirely clear how far Mr. Trump and his team will go with their threats to increase or impose new tariffs, or to overhaul existing U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The administration, which says its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies are aimed at helping workers in the manufacturing industries, has shown a willingness to use the threat of tariffs to cut deals such as the proposed new North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which in reality promises to have only a slight or moderate effect on industries. Mr. Trump himself has credited the threat of tariffs with bringing trading partners to the negotiating table.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Tough talk, backed up by tough action, has resulted in landmark restructuring\" of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other agreements, says White House <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adviser Peter Navarro. In a recent speech, Mr. Navarro described <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-enforcement cases that end in tariffs on imports as a \"power that was lying dormant for decades.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within Mr. Trump's administration, however, there are differences of opinion between <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hawks like Mr. Navarro and more traditional, business-friendly Republican officials. Last month, Mr. Navarro lashed out at Wall Street for seeking to press its version of a deal to de-escalate the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict with China. Days later, Lawrence Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Mr. Navarro wasn't speaking for the president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Uncertainty about how hard the White House will push on tariffs and sweeping new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements has complicated decisions for business leaders. Many businesses are complaining already about tariffs on imports. Many U.S. companies are paying more for steel and aluminum due to tariffs imposed by President Trump, for example, and they could face additional hurdles if the U.S. puts more duties in place, or if trading partners use tariffs to retaliate against U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A potential worst-case scenario for many companies could see the Trump administration extending U.S. tariffs to all imports from China, as well as imposing auto tariffs of 25% on light cars and parts form outside North America, all in addition to the continuation of current steel and aluminum duties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some U.S. companies, to be sure, are benefiting from new tariffs. Mr. Trump has defended the metals tariffs as helping steel and aluminum producers and their workers. The United Steelworkers won pay increases for its workers in November.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. auto industry, meanwhile, is less sanguine about White House proposals for tariffs on imports. Auto makers, parts suppliers and dealers have expressed fears that the Trump administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy will backfire and lead to higher prices and lost jobs as producers such as General Motors Co. look to avoid tariffs and build more production in growing car markets in Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House is using its threat of possible tariffs on auto and auto-parts imports in negotiations it has launched with the EU and Japan. Some officials, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have expressed impatience with a lack of concessions from the EU in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, and President Trump criticized France following a visit with President Emmanuel Macron last month.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Formal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks with the EU and Japan can't begin before January, only weeks before the February deadline for Mr. Ross to release a report on possible auto tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By around the middle of next year, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal -- known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, or USMCA -- is expected to go to the Senate and House of Representatives for approval. Under 2015 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> legislation, both chambers must take up the agreement quickly, barring extraordinary steps leadership could take to derail a vote. Congressional aides say they expect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and the new House speaker to work toward a deal on legislation to implement the new pact, especially since Mr. Trump has signaled he'll withdraw from the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Labor unions have indicated they could lobby for the agreement if the Trump administration shores up enforcement mechanisms for higher labor standards in Mexico. If labor does support the agreement, that could pave the way for ratification by discouraging attempts by Democratic leaders to deprive Mr. Trump of a major policy victory.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Predictions are risky, but a first look suggests at a minimum that many of the incoming Democrats will be open-minded on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and that it would be a mistake to start planning the funeral\" for the USMCA, says Bill Reinsch, a former congressional aide to both parties and current senior <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Mauldin is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Washington.

{"id": "409546270.xml", "text": "<h2>Bending on Steel</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The distance the current Democratic presidential contenders have strayed from the Clinton formula for winning the White House became startlingly clear last week with their reaction to President Bush's decision to remove the tariffs on imported steel that he had imposed 21 months before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats had a free shot at Bush for inconsistency, and most of them took it. But every e-mailed comment I saw from them said or implied that they would not have responded as Bush did when the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization ruled that the tariffs were unjustified and European nations threatened to slap $2.2 billion of retaliatory levies on U.S. products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party whose last president fought against protectionism and for international agreements to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has moved a long way in the other direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some of the candidates, this was a no-brainer. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri opposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the normalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China during the time Bill Clinton was president -- a stand that has earned him support from most of the major industrial unions this year. His comment that \"the president's action today demonstrates a callous disregard for the workers and the communities whose jobs and livelihoods have been decimated by unfair competition\" was entirely predictable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So was the similar blast from Rep. Dennis Kucinich. His home state of Ohio is a major steel producer, and many thought that Bush's original decision to impose stiff tariffs on foreign steel was a bid to strengthen his reelection hand precisely in such steelmaking states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But consider Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a consistent supporter of liberal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies throughout his career and a backer of the major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Rather than reiterate those beliefs, he said: \"We need a manufacturing plan with a spine of steel to promote American businesses and workers, not a manufactured plan that bends with every gust of wind.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who has been steadily tacking away from his earlier support of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as he tries to head off Gephardt in Iowa, went further than Lieberman. \"The president's decision to lift the steel tariffs early is just another example of this administration playing politics with people's lives,\" Dean said. \"When he imposed the tariffs, the president's rhetoric suggested that he actually cared about American steelworkers, their families and the communities in which they live. If that were the case, he would not be lifting them today.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within days after this bow to protectionism, Dean was endorsed by former vice president Al Gore, the same man who had defended <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in a notable debate with Ross Perot -- another sign of the seismic shift among Democrats on this issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the most interesting case is retired Gen. Wesley Clark. He is the favorite of many Clintonians, including Mickey Kantor, a key operative in Clinton's 1992 campaign and later his top <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. Just a few weeks ago, I attended a news conference where Kantor joined two others who had served as special <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative in Republican administrations, Carla Hills and Clayton Yeutter, in urging the Bush administration to take bolder steps to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. Kantor said specifically that while he thought at the time the steel tariffs were imposed that they were justified, it was imperative that they be lifted now -- as Bush subsequently did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Clark obviously did not consult Kantor, a senior adviser, on this question. In a most peculiar fashion, Clark first issued a statement that accused Bush of \"taking his cues\" from \"steel industry executives\" he had been with \"at a fundraiser in Pittsburgh.\" That made no sense, because the steel executives wanted the tariffs to remain in effect. So, 26 minutes later, came a correction from Clark's Little Rock headquarters, eliminating the bogus charge and complaining that Bush \"still has no strategy to help the 2.6 million manufacturing workers who have lost their jobs.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those job losses are real and have been underway for years. The Bush White House, with its politically driven and inconsistent actions, in effect has confessed that it has no answers to the problem. The Democrats are more than eager to exploit the situation and offer, with varying degrees of conviction and coherence, formulas they claim will help revive the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is being lost in the debate is the conviction that led Clinton -- and his Republican predecessors -- to place the United States on the side of reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and expanding international markets. This issue is a lot more serious than either party's approach to it would ever let you know.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>davidbroder@washpost.com</p>\n"}

Done with bipartisan bonhomie, the episode illuminates the decay of government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bill Clinton's finest achievement as president, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, passed in December 1993 with more Senate and House support from Republicans (34 and 132) than from Democrats (27 and 102). Many Democrats predicted devastation of U.S. manufacturing, and Donald Trump was characteristically Cassandra-like. Today manufacturing capacity is 66 percent larger than in 1994. Undeterred by evidence, candidate Trump termed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a \"disaster\" and \"the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever signed anywhere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As president he is replacing it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is remarkably similar to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with two significant exceptions: It is the first U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement designed to decrease <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and it is larded with Democratic policy objectives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) notes, under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> there were zero tariffs on 100 percent of manufactured goods and 97.5 percent of agricultural products that crossed the three nations' borders. U.S. exports to Mexico increased 500 percent. The USMCA's constructive modernizations of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \u2014 the enormous digital economy did not exist in 1994 \u2014 are, Toomey says, \"mostly taken from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" which was negotiated by the Obama administration, and for that reason was anathema to Trump. His scrapping of the TPP was a gift to China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA ends free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in automobiles and auto parts with Mexico: By imposing impossible minimum-wage requirements on Mexican factories, the USMCA guarantees that cars and parts will be subject to tariffs \u2014 taxes paid by U.S. consumers. The USMCA also compels Mexico to change its labor laws to promote unionization. And the provision that the USMCA expires in 16 years is, Toomey says, \"designed to have a chilling effect on investment.\" He notes that members of Congress who have opposed every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement before this one support it, as does the AFL-CIO, which generally opposes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's substance is regrettable. The process that produced it was even more so because it was lawless.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agreements that fully comply with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority (TPA) cannot be amended and can be passed by a simple majority. But the USMCA did not comply: The implementing legislation was not submitted to Congress 30 days before a committee or floor vote on it, a requirement necessary if Congress is to perform its constitutional duty to establish <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Also, the TPA requires that the implementing legislation contain only provisions \"strictly necessary or appropriate\" for implementation. Otherwise, the TPA's expedited process could be used to sneak extraneous matters into law without adequate scrutiny, or possible opposition through amendment, or a 60-vote threshold. But for the first time ever, implementing legislation contained appropriations, $843 million, including $50 million for salaries and expenses for the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative, which was designated an \"emergency.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate and its once-formidable Finance Committee are, Toomey believes, being \"marginalized\" and made \"irrelevant\" as the executive wields authority delegated to it by Congress \u2014 but without Congress insisting on compliance with the terms of the delegation. The question, Toomey says, is: \"Are we willing to enforce our own law that governs the proceedings of this body?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) felt similarly in December when Congress \"passed a $1.4 trillion spending extravaganza, complete with half a trillion dollars in tax cuts and a bevy of favors for special interests \u2014 all without debate and without committee consideration, based on decisions made by the bill's sponsors over a weekend.\" The $300 billion \"Cadillac tax,\" a restraint on lavish employer-provided health plans, was repealed. This demonstrated that Congress cannot repeal Obamacare but will not pay for it. Amendments were not allowed, debate was limited to 90 minutes, and the Senate voted on the bill less than three days after it was unveiled. \"Senate leadership clearly didn't want it to be understood or discussed,\" Cassidy said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 116th Congress, now in its second year, there have been, Toomey notes, votes on just 20 amendments \u2014 one was a \"sense of the Senate\" legal nullity, four were \"noncontroversial or largely devoid of substance,\" six \"were killed using a procedural maneuver,\" and none of the other nine \"came close to passage.\" The Finance Committee has held one substantive markup in 13 months.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's institutional vandalism is partially explained, although not excused, by the breadth and depth of his ignorance concerning the manners and mores of a republic.

Several have been unspooling in my mind these days: \"All About Eve,\" \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"A Star Is Born,\" even \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" if one assumes the Clintons are going to either pull off this heist or go down in a blaze of bullets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary's star is being eclipsed. Why?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A year ago, Hillary Clinton assumed the effort would bring her the prize. Instead, it has brought her to the precipice. What happened? What was supposed to be triumph has turned to tragedy. Who rewrote the plot?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first revision came at the hand of Howard Dean. The Vermont governor's quixotic 2004 presidential run did one big thing: It let the netroots out. It empowered the Democratic Left. Web-based \"progressives\" proved they could raise lots of political money and bring pressure, especially when allied with labor unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They didn't defeat centrist Joe Lieberman in 2006, but they drove him out of the party. They pushed the party's Iraq policy under Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi into total, rejectionist opposition. In this world, the Petraeus surge is a failure, period. Thus, Obama calmly gives the surge little or no credit. Also in this world, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are anathema, as seen in the House refusal to pass the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Colombia, the U.S.'s strongest ally in South America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the netroots has done is bunch up the party ideologically. While the Republican Party slices conservative ideology as thinly as aged prosciutto, the Democrats, in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, are all swinging a populist anvil -- with the left hand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This pushed Hillary out of the Clinton comfort zone. She established her Senate career as a reasonable person, winning public compliments from GOP colleagues. Came the campaign and she finds herself onstage with wall-to-wall men of the ascendant populist left.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the Democratic Party is as far left as at any time in its history. Both Al Gore and John Kerry ran as economic populists, but there was nothing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> like what we have heard in this campaign. In Al Gore's 2000 nomination acceptance speech, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was the last issue mentioned: \"We must welcome and promote truly free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" His running mate was Joe Lieberman, also a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporter. Labor \"held its nose\" and voted for Gore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party next nominated another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporter, John Kerry, whose acceptance speech also reduced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to a line, with a quick bow to \"a fair playing field.\" There was talk that Kerry would cover himself by putting the ardently anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, pro-union Dick Gephardt on the ticket. Labor lost that one, too, but with the selection of John Edwards, the party became more invested in left-leaning populism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both Al Gore and John Kerry ran out of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tradition established by the Clintons and Democrats who straddled the center -- free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as a proven economic benefit but with pressure applied at the margins on labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barack Obama slipped smoothly into the anti-free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> current in his party. Hillary Clinton, one guesses, operates inside a structure of intellectual integrity of her own devising, and her anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> riffs (the \"time out\") sound strained.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's often said that she lacks Bill's political skills, whatever that means. Her retail skills are pretty darned good, though, good enough to defeat John Edwards or virtually any other Democrat one can imagine. So why is she losing to a three-year senator?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Partly because she's running in the wrong century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary's politics is the world of Eleanor Roosevelt, when it was all being born anew. The Washington of LBJ's Great Society in the mid- 1960s was alive with policy debates -- among Democrats. By now, the Democratic Party's ideas are largely generic. Everyone noticed that the Democratic presidential candidates were largely singing from the same script. Health care, public schools, green energy, the eternal shafting of the middle class, the unions, protecting Social Security and Medicare. This common script means that the Democratic primaries are largely an audition. The candidates are reading for a role. The lines are known.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The part, however, is challenging. The Democratic platform may be familiar, but it is also infused with the quality of a dream. Actually, the word \"dream\" gets used a lot in Democratic rhetoric. What are essentially bureaucratic arrangements, such as health insurance or after-school programs, are promised as \"universal.\" Meanwhile, \"the middle class\" is being offered a version of never- never land -- total public protection from the traps and betrayals of the private sector, which has been reduced to a kind of Grimm's Fairy Tale abstraction, the wolves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you are selling a dream you need the best possible salesman to make it seem somehow possible. They found him in Barack Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hillary attacked Obama this week on exactly this basis -- for selling dreams: \"And you know the celestial choirs will be singing . . . and the world will be perfect.\" In her world \"none of the problems we face will be easily solved.\" In her world, the real one, mediocre pols must be worked and massive bureaucracies pushed to do the right thing. And you know what? She just might be good at it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bitter irony is that what the Democrats want is someone like the original Clinton, another figure who can make the old-time religion sound not like a government program, but personally uplifting. She can't. In the Cleveland debate Tuesday, even Brian Williams couldn't resist noting \"a 16-minute discussion on health care.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're about six days away from the last close-up. What Hillary Clinton has invested, given and endured for her party to get to this moment is hard to imagine. Then the Democratic audience says: What difference does that make? A star has been born. Now comes the mad scene.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "398277030.xml", "text": "<h2>Global View: On Global Issues, Perot Sounds Texas League</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the G-7 economic summit in Munich this week George Bush and six other heads of government are tackling such knotty matters as how to help Russia avoid a dangerous economic collapse, how to break the Uruguay Round deadlock and how to regenerate world-wide economic growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush will be in an anomalous position. He is the most powerful national leader at Munich but is at the same time losing the support of voters at home. That would be more serious were it not for the fact that his fellow leaders, with the possible exception of John Major, are no better off. Whether that will make the seven chieftains more fraternal or more touchy in their deliberations is anyone's guess. Insecure politicians sometimes are better bedfellows than confident ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But since we are discussing Mr. Bush's political problems, let's imagine for a moment that the U.S. leader at Munich is not George Bush, but President Ross Perot. The diminutive Texan has been first choice in some recent popularity polls and is expected to announce his presidential candidacy soon. He can no longer be ignored, however unlikely it is that the well-justified anti-Beltway mood of the voters will translate into an actual Perot victory. Would Mr. Perot be any good at what is arguably the most important constitutional responsibility of an American President, the conduct of foreign policy?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What little evidence exists is not encouraging. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is the only foreign policy issue that Mr. Perot has addressed in any detail. His orientation was not that of a world leader but of a narrowly focused Texas businessman. Specifically, he attacked George Bush's efforts to bring the U.S., Canada and Mexico into a North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). He treated a press conference to a twangy dissertation on why a businessman, under conditions of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, would \"naturally\" move his factory from the U.S. to Mexico to take advantage of lower wage and pension costs and other presumed advantages. American workers would suffer, he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, this seemingly pragmatic logic is not pragmatic at all, even on its own narrow terms. Factory owners do not move production willy-nilly. They consider sunk costs in existing facilities. Nor do they locate new plants solely on the basis of raw labor costs. They consider proximity to markets, transportation costs, the educational level of the work force, the political stability of the host country, the willingness of managers to relocate, the availability of parts and raw materials and a good many other factors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Removal of tariff barriers in the European Community has not caused German manufacturers to move en masse to Greece or Portugal, even though labor costs certainly are lower there. What has in fact happened is that both the northern and southern countries of the EC have developed, as is invariably the case when restrictions on commerce are removed. Markets for both goods and labor become broader, allowing companies to take advantage of economies of scale and comparative advantage. It is a dynamic process, involving temporary job losses certainly but, on balance, upward mobility for able workers to better, more productive jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Americans know all this intuitively. They have seen the world open up with new opportunities. Japanese auto companies create jobs in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Bavarische Motoren Werke AG of Germany has just announced a plan to build a $625 million assembly plant near Spartanburg, S.C., drawing parts and components from Germany, Austria, the U.S. and, yes, Mexico. As they see all this internationalization of business taking place around them, Americans consistently reject protectionist reaction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet here is Mr. Perot, in his first ventures into saying something that sounds like a policy position, using those old protectionist code words, \"level playing field\" and \"fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" Anyone who has spent many hours, as I have, listening to businessmen lobby for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers has heard it all many times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the basis of what we know so far, a President Perot at Munich would be punching air with parochial slogans instead of furthering the interests of the U.S. and the world in a freer global business environment. John Major, who is trying to rid the United Kingdom of the vestiges of corporatism, would be appalled to hear a Ross Perot talking about assembling American CEO's to find ways to make the U.S. more competitive. He might suggest, if Mr. Perot cared to listen, that CEOs are better employed running their own companies than trying to collaborate with politicians on national industrial policy schemes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the question of personality. An American President does not need to be a silky voiced diplomat, but he must take other national leaders seriously. Mr. Perot has seemed singularly incapable of taking anyone seriously other than himself. He described his fellow board members at General Motors as \"pet rocks.\" That made a hit with GM's critics but also signalled to Roger Smith that Mr. Perot's ego was far too large to allow him to be of much use in achieving the goal the two of them shared, a streamlining of the GM bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which poses the central problem of Ross Perot. The qualities that are winning him a political following are also the ones that cast doubts on his chances for a successful presidency. His fiesty, iconoclastic style raises hopes that he might be able to reassert presidential control over the U.S. government and wrench it out of the hands of Congress and the special interests Congress serves. But he has not said or done anything so far that suggests he is capable of such a feat. He is clearly bright but his few policy utterances, such as that dealing with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, suggest ignorance on major national and international issues. His one-man-band approach to problem solving ignores the fact that today the most important thing an American President can do is strengthen alliances against all the forces for political fragmentation that now are loose in the world. There are few of those alliances more important than the one with Japan, the bete noire of American protectionists. East Asia's potential for political instability is high and the U.S. has a large stake in that region, in the form of both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Munich, a President Perot would find himself face to face with men much more experienced in politics than he. None of them are \"pet rocks,\" he would soon find out. But they all would know, perhaps better than he, that the U.S. is not a competitive basket case but rather a very powerful country, both politically and economically. Should he not be able to supply the leadership they want, they would quickly search for alternatives. The world would get messier, and down-home homilies would be of no help.</p>\n"}

Does this migratory and diplomatic crisis have a solution?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe not, but there is at least an explanation for it, which lies in another question. Why, after all his huffing and puffing, did President Trump accept a watered-down version of a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, known now as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows for sure, but after nearly 40 years of being intimately involved, as an academic and public official, with these situations, I can offer an informed guess: The United States gave up most of its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> demands in exchange for a confidential commitment by Mexico to do Washington\u2019s dirty work against would-be immigrants and refugees. Of course, this is speculation, and the evidence is all circumstantial.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From experience, though, I know how both countries, for diverse reasons, tried always to keep different issues on the bilateral agenda separate and not mix them together. In an ideal world today, that is how it would be, but not with Mr. Trump. These American bureaucratic traditions, which Mexico always counted on to maintain stability and sensibility in the relationship, have been overturned. Immigration and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have become intimately linked, at least in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. Therein lies part of the origins of the current caravan crisis. It is not just Trumpian electioneering.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sept. 29, Mexico, Canada and the United States finally reached a deal on a revised version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that was promptly rebranded by Mr. Trump with a new name largely because it doesn\u2019t have much new content. The president achieved far less than he originally sought.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His initial goals \u2014 reducing the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, bringing automobile jobs back to the United States \u2014 are unlikely to be accomplished any time soon, if at all. He acquiesced to a deal that fell far short of his ambitions. And he hardly mentions it on the campaign trail as one of his signature triumphs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it seems probable that Mr. Trump\u2019s ultimate goal, at the end of the day, was to obtain Mexican cooperation on security at the border and immigration from Central America. As he tweeted : \u201cThe assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> or the USMCA ... Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border.\u201d For now, it hasn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump himself mentioned this bilateral cooperation as part of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. At a White House news conference on Oct. 1 , when flaunting the agreement, he said it explicitly: \u201cYeah, we talked about it (the wall, border security). With Mexico, we talked about it. It was a big part. And certain things and certain understandings are had. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to mix it up too much. This is a very big deal and very good deal for everybody. But border security and security generally is a very big factor.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was probably referring to the two main American demands on Mexico that have been made public in the United States press over the past weeks. They are ominous for Mexico and ignoble for the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Washington has been pressing the outgoing president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto , to sign what is known as a Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States. This entails Mexico processing Central American asylum claims locally, and allowing American authorities to deny any claim for asylum in the United States, since Mexico would be considered a \u201csafe third country.\u201d With violence in Mexico at its highest point in decades , and many Central Americans being murdered there in recent years, it is hard to see the merits of such a certification by Washington, much less its acceptance by Mexico. So far, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has resisted that pressure; the caravan is moving freely through Mexico .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can suppose, however, that the incoming president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, may have less leeway, especially if this arrangement was a precondition for a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Mr. Trump has stated that the Honduran caravan members must request asylum first in Mexico without any legal basis for doing so . Mexico has no reason for proceeding this way, except for United States pressure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, and most important, since 2014 under President Obama, and now more than ever, Washington has pressured Mexico to shut down as much as possible of its southern border \u2014 in a nutshell, to do its dirty work. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has reluctantly gone along, but the cost for Mexico is rising, and he is soon to be no longer in charge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is why it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the Trump administration conditioned its acceptance of a diluted new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on Mexico\u2019s acceptance of more cooperation, or complicity, with the United States, for keeping Central Americans, be they refugees, economic migrants, or a combination of both, from reaching the United States border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is what Mr. Pompeo said in Mexico: Stop the Hondurans from reaching the United States border. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has insinuated that he won\u2019t maintain this policy. Knowing him on and off for more than 30 years, I think the chances are that if he is left no choice, having agreed to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>/immigration <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-off, he might cave in to American pressure, despite his displeasure and current denials. He has staked too much on USMCA as a source of economic stability for his incoming government to put it at risk simply because of Central American refugees. But deporting thousands of Central Americans or placing them by force in refugee camps would be intolerable for his supporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is obviously a great deal of electoral distraction in all of this, and Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster on these matters has proved meaningless in the past. Still, these pressures on immigration, coupled with the rise of deportations of Mexicans from the United States heartland, bode not well for Mexico nor for the United States. These approaches are harmful for Mexico, and unworthy of the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pompeo\u2019s flash visit to Mexico City confirmed what has been known for months. Immigration is at the top of the Trump agenda with Mexico (and other countries); this approach is damaging to Mexico, Central America and the United States. The new government in Mexico, a hypothetical new majority in the House of Representatives, and hundreds of thousands of Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees should all be aware of this. Together, they are responsible for designing a response that is both effective and practical, but most importantly, humanitarian.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Jorge G.

The Voting Rights Act bent the status quo against itself, forcing a political system built almost entirely on exclusion toward democracy.

{"id": "421498571.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD; MEXICO; Economic Growth Meets Weak Local Government</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Natural disasters have a way of exposing the weaknesses of Mexico's political system. The torrential rains and floods that hit central and Gulf Coast Mexico this month show how antiquated, inefficient and dangerous the system of governance is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tropical storm that swept across the states of Puebla, Hidalgo, Veracruz and Tabasco earlier this month was devastating enough. But what made the flooding that followed Mexico's \"worst disaster in a decade, in terms of lives lost\" (in President Ernesto Zedillo's words) can be illustrated by events in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As much rain fell on this bustling mountain in three days this month as usually falls all year. But Teziutlan seemed wealthy enough to protect itself. The city has become an enormous sewing center and one of Mexico's great success stories since the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement went into effect. American Eagle jeans and Oscar de la Renta shirts are among the lines produced here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it turned out, flooding created the worst tragedy in the city's history: close to 200 people killed in landslides, 500 homes destroyed, another 1,200 damaged, many more unlivable, thousands of people left homeless. A landslide at the La Aurora neighborhood, which is slapped onto the side of a hill, took dozens of homes and what investigators believe will eventually be more than 150 people with it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People began building in the area about 15 years ago. But the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> sewing boom sent a hodgepodge of houses scurrying up the hillside. It was all unplanned, without proper subdivision. Teziutlan officials were helpless to manage the growth or insist on proper construction. Nor did they have a budget to install storm drains, repair cracked water pipes or pave the streets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Teziutlan disaster is what happens when rapid economic growth meets a political system chiefly designed to manage poverty. Mexican local government, where this growth occurs, is unprepared to control, direct or benefit from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican cities' budgets, which are determined by Mexico City, are so minuscule that they cannot build and maintain infrastructure or hire capable civil servants. They have only slight taxing power. Moreover, mayors and city councils are barred from reelection: Every three years, they leave, and much of the city staff leaves with them. A newly elected slate must learn to govern from scratch. Mexican city government is thus characterized by constant improvisation and a lack of long-term planning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one reason why economic growth in Mexico translates so slowly into economic development and higher standards of living. \"Globalization grabs us. It develops us very quickly,\" says Jose Luis Olvera, Teziutlan's director of public works. \"But as a government, we haven't been able to take the measures necessary to keep up. This is a national problem. Many places in the country are like this.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan has had a sewing industry since the 1920s. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> lowered tariffs on clothing among its three participating countries-- Mexico, Canada and the United States--Teziutlan boomed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least 100 plants have sprung up since 1994, when the treaty took effect. No one's even sure how many plants there are, since small maquiladoras were set up in houses or shops and the city doesn't have the staff to monitor them. The garment-industry work force, meanwhile, has swelled to about 35,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The maquiladoras gave rural folk from impoverished surrounding villages steady work, health benefits and the ability to educate their children. But the only places where the workers could live were on hillsides or in ravines. The choice was brutish: Starve at home or come to work in Teziutlan and live on the side of a hill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan's economy generates money that could provide for the basic infrastructure the city lacks. The money just doesn't stay in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Mexican system of government, all tax receipts go to the central government in Mexico City, which redistributes them to the states and cities. Cities get only 5% of revenues. The taxes that Teziutlan's maquiladoras pay subsidize the central government rather than help finance the local infrastructure needs that their businesses and employees create.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should be a huge boon to a local economy instead becomes a cause for disaster. Local government cannot take full advantage of the investment coming into Mexico. That, in turn, prevents Mexico from enjoying the full benefits of one of its greatest comparative advantages: Its neighbor is the wealthiest consumer market in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, Teziutlan will have difficulty leveraging its sewing industry into more skilled and remunerative manufacturing. It has no civil service to envision or plan for such a development. It has no money for job-training programs. It can't offer incentives to other types of manufacturing to relocate here. Its maquiladora owners have formed a committee to demand more infrastructure investment, but the city has nothing to respond with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When wages hit a ceiling that garment makers can't afford, or when the city becomes too congested, the sewing plants, which are notoriously easy to set up and to abandon, will likely go elsewhere. Sewing will no longer be Teziutlan's stepping stone to something better.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Virtually every growing Mexican city is ringed with shantytowns that lack electricity, paved streets, drinking water and storm-drain systems. These cities generate money, but they don't get to spend it. Their ad hoc administrations can't prevent shantytowns and unplanned neighborhoods like La Aurora, but neither can they provide for them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are as anemic as Teziutlan. The only difference is that these other cities haven't had a natural disaster come their way--yet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sam Quinones, an Alicia Patterson fellow for 1998, is working on a book about Mexico</p>\n"}

Bush was president</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>for just four years, his economic legacy on taxes, banking and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> reverberate today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush owed his election in 1988 in part to the low inflation and solid growth during the administration of Ronald Reagan, whom Mr. Bush served as vice president. Yet imbalances that took root under Mr. Reagan would haunt his successor's presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One imbalance was the budget deficit. In his losing campaign for the presidential nomination in 1980, Mr. Bush famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply-side tax cuts as \"voodoo economics.\" Yet as vice president he faithfully defended those tax cuts and in his 1988 campaign declared, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* George H.W.

The tax cuts had bequeathed persistent deficits and Congress had passed laws in 1985 and 1987 to trigger across-the-board spending cuts if deficits weren't addressed. To avert those provisions, Democrats, who controlled Congress, insisted that spending cuts be accompanied by tax increases. Mr. Bush acquiesced and broke his pledge in 1990.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have ever since blamed that decision both for the recession that began that year and Mr. Bush's defeat in 1992. Reality is more complicated. The recession was mild, ending in March 1991, long before Mr. Bush would face the voters again. But it didn't feel that way because unemployment continued to rise into 1992. Such jobless recoveries were unheard of at the time but have since become commonplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The jobless recovery can be traced to a second imbalance Mr. Bush inherited: a banking system, including thousands of savings and loan institutions, unable to lend because of bad real-estate loans attributable to lax oversight and haphazard deregulation. Mr. Bush's Treasury officials were preoccupied with cleaning up that mess and implementing sounder regulations. One of them, Jerome Powell, would take those lessons with him to the Federal Reserve where, as chairman, he remains acutely sensitive to how financial imbalances can threaten growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his foreign policy triumphs--driving Iraq out of Kuwait and smoothing the fallout from the end of the Cold War--Mr. Bush lost to Bill Clinton and his relentless focus on the economy. Another factor: a loss of support to third-party candidate Ross Perot. Mr. Perot was motivated in part by opposition to another Bush decision: negotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a watershed in globalization. It was quantitatively less important than the integration of billions of workers from Eastern Europe and China into the global economy, the creation of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 1994, and advances in technology. But as the first free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact between rich and poor countries, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came to symbolize the collision of interests between blue collar workers on one hand and consumers, corporations, and geostrategic cooperation on the other. Opposition to it was a centerpiece of President Trump's campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush left a substantive economic legacy: his record on deficit reduction, bank repair and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization paved the way for the long expansion of the 1990s, budget surpluses and a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> boom. The political consequences are much more contentious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mr. Bush signed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it was up to President Bill Clinton whether to seek its ratification. His decision to do so marked a pivot by Democratic presidents and presidential candidates toward an embrace of globalization and away from the party's blue-collar base. Contemplating how rust-belt workers flocked to Mr. Trump's stridently nationalist message in 2016, many Democrats now regret that pivot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Republicans, Mr. Bush's 1992 loss has become a cautionary tale; inflexible opposition to higher taxes is now integral to the party's identity. No Republican president since has raised taxes. It is one of the few things on which Mr. Trump and his party's establishment agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These political pressures are coming to a boil. There are no longer enough free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs in either party to push globalization forward; the question is whether there are enough to keep it from sliding backward. Mr. Trump has renegotiated a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> yet this past weekend promised to exit from the old agreement even if the new one isn't ratified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tax cut passed by Republicans and signed by Mr. Trump has caused the budget deficit to balloon when a strong economy should be shrinking it, setting up battles over whose programs will be cut and whose taxes will be raised for years to come. Though a product of the divisive climate that prevails today, these tensions all have roots in decisions George H.W.

{"id": "293459078.xml", "text": "<h2>Ernesto Zedillo ..DH: Tackling Economic Crises, Corruption and Political Violence in Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No Mexican president in modern times has faced the array of problems--from economic crisis to armed insurrection--that Ernesto Zedillo has in his first 21 months in office. Yet, Zedillo does not appear overwhelmed. Indeed, he is no longer the accidental candidate who filled the political vacuum created by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, his party's presidential candidate, in March 1994. Zedillo confidently predicts that he will pull his country out of its state of emergency in the near future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately for him, such confidence is not widely shared in other quarters of Mexico--especially where there are strong doubts about Zedillo's abilities as a leader.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until now, the Zedillo administration, with public support, has been able to pass most of the blame for the country's ills onto the previous administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. This has given Zedillo the freedom to make progress on some key fronts. He has adjusted the economy to a devalued peso and brought about the start of a recovery. He has successfully negotiated an agreement among Mexico's major political parties to achieve political reform. He has strengthened the muscle of the judiciary branch by reconstituting the supreme court and purging the ranks of the corrupted federal police. He has called in the military to cleanse Mexico City's police force. He claims to have captured the hired guns who killed Colosio and another prominent politician.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These accomplishments are undeniable, but Zedillo is still far from achieving success. Jobs lost during the severe economic recession have not been replaced. Businesses that went belly up after the peso was devalued in December 1994 have not reopened. His handling of the economy has drawn strong political opposition, even from within his own party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). A persistent wave of criminal violence, fed, in large part, by drug trafficking, plagues Mexico's cities and towns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there are Mexico's two continuing insurrections. In Chiapas, talks with Subcomandante Marcos and his Zapatistas have been suspended. In southern and central Mexico, an especially violent revolutionary group, known as the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), recently staged a series of daring attacks in six Mexican states, leaving 16 dead.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sitting in his office at Los Pinos, Zedillo, trim and fit, discussed these enormous problems sounding more like a scientist than a politician--but never ducking an opportunity to take on his critics. Yet, for many Mexicans, the question is whether their president has the fire to exercise the kind of authority needed to govern Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Question: You have made a distinction between the EPR and the Zapatistas. And, in fact, you have a strange type of official relationship with the Chiapas group. The government allows an armed group of people who want to overthrow the government to organize tours for Hollywood movie-makers. What is going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answer: Well, in Chiapas we are half-way solving the problem. We want to reach an agreement in which the government accepts the just social and political claims of this group and, in return, they disarm and join the political route to participate in the civic life of the country. In between, there is no violence, they keep their arms and are free to organize their propaganda activities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Violence, however, has made a comeback and many analysts believe the national-security apparatus in Mexico has collapsed since 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Violence has many varieties and is surfacing. But this is happening not only in Mexico. There seems to be a new wave of violence worldwide--sometimes even promoted by the media. In Mexico, we have had political assassinations, and we don't know yet what were the causes for those murders, because they are extremely complicated cases. The investigation continues its course. Regarding violence perpetrated by common criminals, the explanation is that our laws have been too lenient and our institutions have failed because they have not grown as the country has grown. Some of these institutions have been corrupted. So we're adjusting our laws to the times we are living in and reforming our institutions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Regarding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, there is a genuine concern of a sector of society, but some people are also using it for political gain. Do you see it that way?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I have always condemned the sensationalization and the extra-legal pressures used in this case. Almost every week, there is a new hypothesis of the killing. Everybody has the right to express an opinion, but sensationalism and extra-legal pressures dilute the search for truth and the achievement of justice. Some people would like me to become prosecutor and judge; to do so would be illegal and useless. What I have done, as president, is to ensure the absolute independence of the judiciary system . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: I know you don't believe there is a conspiracy in place since 1994, but do you believe there is a power struggle going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: No. I honestly don't believe there is a power struggle going on. It would be easy for me to say that the problems I face are the byproducts of a conspiracy, but that would be a lie . . . . Each one of the troubles we've gone through has its own logic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In Mexico, the government is blamed for every problem, whether it is poverty or inequality or unemployment. What do you see as your responsibility?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility began Dec. 1, 1994, but the government has to confront each one of these problems. Poverty is a 500-year-old problem, but it is my problem now. Regarding our economic problems, I think they began three years ago. We went through a process of accumulation until the crisis burst . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: The crisis began three years ago?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes. We had a very high deficit in the current-account {balance} in 1992, '93 and '94, and we allowed ourselves to reach a situation that led us to the crisis. But that is irrelevant. Now that is my problem and I must solve it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: However, in April 1994, you told me, \"After 10 years of macroeconomic adjustments, we can now tell the people they will reap the benefits after so much sacrifice.\" Either you did not know what was happening or there were mistakes later. Also troubling is the fact that you were the programming and budget secretary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes, but up until 1991.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But you were the candidate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: That is a good question and let's deal with it. To run into a crisis, you have to link a series of events that individually would hardly create a crisis. It is like an accident. We had a serious dependency on foreign capital. Some saw this flow of capital as a positive sign, as a symbol of economic vitality, of confidence in our country. However, when some events shook the confidence of the foreign investor, the flow was read in a different light. Remember, the money for these so-called emergent markets came from new and different sources, the stock exchange, pension funds, etc. Nobody knew how they would behave in an emergent market if a given situation would turn out different from the norm. These were the factors we had to confront . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason why we are coming out of this national emergency is precisely because the Mexican economy has a structural strength it had never had. After the 1982 crisis, it took us seven years to begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, because our economy back then was obsolete, unproductive and incapable of functioning in the current global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you believe there should have been a devaluation before the election?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In retrospect, it is real easy to say that, and it certainly could have been much more comfortable to start my government with an economy in the process of a severe adjustment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But would you have won the election after a devaluation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: The only time I am aware that a devaluation was considered was on Nov. 20, 1994. That was 10 days before my inauguration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What happened in December '94, and who is responsible?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I wish the crisis had been the result of one decision--because it would not have been as big a crisis and it would have been easy to solve. We had a crisis because the country was spending more than it was producing. This took years, and then there were so many more issues involved. We had become addicted to flows of foreign capital, and these represented 7% or 8% of GNP. We also had to pay more than $41 billion in bonds, shares, Tesobonos, Cetes that matured around that date. These problems were not created in one day. We had to adjust the country back to reality and that is precisely what made an impact in the people's living standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some critics say you have a long-term vision, to build up an efficient, competitive economy, whereas the people have short-term needs--they want a job or higher wages. Is this a problem?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility is to work long term, but that does not mean we don't measure the short-term effects of long-term actions. If we had followed an adjustment program in '95, in the short term it would have meant more sacrifices for the people and it would have taken longer to overcome the economic emergency. Gradualism is not an option, because that would have taken us to total collapse and instead of loosing hundreds of thousands of jobs, we would have lost millions. My long-term policy is the best policy in the short term. Promises won't bring food to the table of the people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What most dominates the relationship between Mexico and the United States: conflict or cooperation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: It is a complex relationship that has many facets and many issues, some extremely difficult. This complexity forces a chiaro/oscuro type of relationship. President Clinton is very cooperative and has helped us in the most difficult of times. It took a lot of guts to support Mexico as he did. Fortunately, we have paid them back almost the whole loan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's been respect when dealing with difficult issues--such as drug trafficking or immigration; but both countries have tried to solve problems as they come up. From time to time, we have problems like the Helms-Burton law, which I believe is a big mistake, because it violates international law. That is why it is creating so many problems with Canada, the European Union and us. But Helms-Burton cannot contaminate the whole relationship; I hope we can overcome this problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: President Clinton's special envoy for Cuba, Stuart Eizenstat, said, \"It would be a mistake to bring Helms-Burton into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Did you interpret it as a threat or as a warning?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Maybe he said so because he knows we are right, and the U.S. view is wrong. They are asking us to promote democracy in Cuba; well, they should know Mexico has maintained, consistently for many decades, the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other nations. I believe democracy is the best political system, but I don't believe we have the right to interfere in Cuba's domestic affairs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Has the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement worked well for the United States but not for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has performed very well for its three partners. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> has increased in a meaningful way, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed a difficult test in '95. During the Mexican recession, it is remarkable that our purchases in the U.S. did not fall and are now growing strongly again. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is no longer a topic for debate, because we are not talking theory now, but facts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: After the November election in the U.S., couldn't you find a similar framework that would lead to a treaty on immigration?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: We have always been open to reach a permanent solution to this issue. The problem is that the existing economic disparity between both countries is what causes migration. The real solution will come with economic growth in Mexico, but that will take some time. Meanwhile, we should work out agreements to take care of the real demand for Mexican labor in the U.S. in an environment that respects human rights. This approach is difficult for the U.S., because it would mean legalizing many more immigrants than what is politically feasible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: How would you describe yourself? Are you a weak president, as many people say?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: How arrogant and vain would it be that I define myself. I am not pursuing an \"image,\" because I cannot waste my time on those silly exercises. I have been through the hardest period ever for a president in modern Mexico, and when things are difficult, the people demand miraculous and messianic solutions. I have been responsible in avoiding promises no one can deliver. I have remained truthful through painful times. I try, deliberately, not to make authoritarian use of the presidential powers. One of the imperfections of our democracy has been its lack of equilibrium between the federal powers and among the three branches of government. My contribution has been to open spaces for other powers. Because nobody can accuse me of being a thief or corrupt or abusive, they say I am weak. That's fine. I answer my critics with deeds and tough decisions I have had to make without ever considering my index of popularity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: (ERNESTO ZEDILLO); PHOTOGRAPHER: PETER STONE / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ACCN-79918</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sergio Munoz is an editorial writer for The Times.

Most postal workers are union members.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unions now speak for most rank-and-file feds, members or not. Unions are required to represent nonmembers, a situation that sometimes makes both unions and nonmembers angry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unions are sometimes criticized--including in the Federal Diary-- when their leaders embrace, ignore or make tepid protests about things done by Democrats--such as cutting 300,000 jobs and privatizing certain operations--that would be totally unacceptable to them if proposed by Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But unions, by and large, do very good work at the national level- -sometimes despite the fact that some of their leaders insist on cuddling certain politicians and sometimes because of it. Last year was a good one for unions and for groups representing professionals and retirees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Jan. 5 Federal Diary, \"Plenty of Reasons for Paying Dues,\" was intended to give groups that represent federal workers and retirees their due. They had a great year in 1999. They beat back bipartisan efforts to mess with federal benefits and pensions, joined a bipartisan effort to win the biggest pay raise in years and played hardball with political \"friends\" over the issue of contracting out work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The column asked nonmembers to ask themselves why they weren't paying dues. I assumed that feds avoided unions for one of three reasons: They were too cheap to pay dues. They didn't like union political actions. Or they just didn't like unions. Feds who responded said it is more complicated than that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many unions asked for permission to reprint the pay-your-dues column. They probably won't do that with this one. But union leaders might learn something (whether they like it or not) by reading responses from nonmembers:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* \"Why I don't join is because I do not want one red cent of my money going to the Democratic National Committee.\" -- Edward J.

'Supports <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,' and also slams former senator Bill Bradley because he 'opposed labor's position on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.' But what does it say about Vice President Gore, who, along with President Clinton pushed and supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>?

There was no . . . interest in gaining one more member. . . . Based on my personal experience, I will actively fight the fed unions, their officials and their goals.

{"id": "421133076.xml", "text": "<h2>U.S. -- Mexico: How to Lose Friends & Alienate People; DIPLOMACY; Troubles Not Just to South: What of Russia and China?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the southern neighbor of the United States, and source of most of its illegal immigrants and illegal drugs, Mexico is widely perceived as a special case in U.S. foreign relations. This was the assumption behind President Bill Clinton's controversial decision to recertify Mexico as a cooperative partner in the drug war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that assumption is false. Mexico typifies a disturbing development that characterizes all three of America's most important foreign relationships.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is in the throes of an agonizing social and economic transition from a one-party state, with centralized control over the country's industrial and financial system, into a free market that will, with luck, generate a more pluralist political system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One crucial symptom of these wrenching changes is endemic corruption among political, corporate and law-enforcement elites. Another is the growth of organized crime, and the erosion of law and order in major cities. All this is accompanied by a widening and politically destabilizing gap between the rich and the demoralized poor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is precisely the situation in two other countries of central importance to the United States: Russia and China. All three are wounded states in which traditional central authority is in question, and unscrupulous new elites are emerging whose new wealth comes from sources of questionable legality. Their power is such that the usual government-to-government agreements cannot be relied on. These countries have another feature in common: Any U.S. government has relatively few policy tools available to improve their behavior.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The levers at Washington's hand in each case are the same: a little U.S. aid; a great deal more multinational aid, in whose distribution the U.S. has an important say; a great potential in U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and sweet reason--as American policy makers seek to persuade these countries to promote political changes that are in their long-term self-interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These levers have not worked too well. They have not dissuaded Russia from selling advanced weaponry and nuclear technology to Iran; nor from being unhelpful in a process of NATO enlargement whose goal is the democratic stabilization of Eastern Europe, transparently in Russian interests. Nor have these levers yet persuaded Russia to devise a coherent tax code or an investor-friendly economic environment, because the self-interest of corrupt local elites outweighs the national interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These U.S. levers have also failed to persuade China to acknowledge even the basic human-rights decencies; to abide by its own promises to curb the widespread piracy of U.S. and other Western intellectual rights; to pay even lip-service to Hong Kong's democratic institutions, or to control the greed of its arms <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mexico, U.S. aid has been more than generous--and not only in providing intelligence, funds and military-surplus helicopters to Mexico's police and military anti-narcotics units. Clinton defied his own party base in the labor unions, and the Democratic leaders in Congress, to pass the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which has produced a U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, now running at $15 billion a year. One striking foreign-policy decision of Clinton's first term was to take a serious political risk by overruling Congress in order to lead the international bailout of the Mexican peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Successive Mexican political leaders have tried to accommodate U.S. interests. Whatever the role of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his extremely rich and controversial family in the murkier aspects of Mexican life, this Harvard-educated modernizer backed both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the efforts to reform the sclerotic political system. His successor, President Ernesto Zedillo, appears equally intent on pluralistic reform. But rather as Mikhail S. Gorbachev discovered in the Soviet Union, and as Deng Xiaoping's successors are learning in China, dismantling an entrenched one-party structure is difficult.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have only been two triumphantly successful examples of authoritarian states being transformed into prosperous and stable democracies. But in both Japan and West Germany after 1945, the Western allies had troops on the ground to enforce the reforms and nurture the democratic process. In neither Russia, China nor Mexico is it possible to envisage reforms unfolding in similar conditions of political order backed by the presence of an occupying military force.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are three logical responses to this unhappy challenge in the three states. The first is to shrug and accept that, under the principle of noninterference in domestic affairs, these states will go their own way. They lack the traditions of democracy and free enterprise that make the Europeans (relatively speaking) such agreeable partners in the promotion of U.S. interests and values.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second course, essentially the one now pursued, is to provide some aid and facilitate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the hope these levers will do some good with the current political leadership, while effecting a slow socioeconomic transformation that will help bring a more congenial system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not a vain hope. We may cite South Korea, again helped by a U.S. military presence, or Taiwan, with its discreet and offshore guarantee of U.S. military support, as examples. Increasingly democratic, increasingly cooperative in the global-trading system and broadly supportive of U.S. strategic interests, Taiwan and South Korea can be counted as successes for the civilizing effects of U.S. influence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The third course would be far more bold: to hazard an aggressive campaign in support of reform-minded local leaders. This was tried in Iran in the 1970s, with the supportive presence of some 30,000 U.S. personnel trying to modernize the shah's armed forces--and it proved disastrous. Something similar is now being tried in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states: U.S. diplomatic nudges toward local political and economic reforms, backed up by a U.S. military presence. But some lessons from Iran should have been learned. The two terrorist attacks on U.S. military facilities in Saudi Arabia point to the dangers in such a policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without any U.S. military role in Mexico, China or Russia, the question becomes how far an aggressive U.S. role in spurring economic and political reform can be practical. Massive amounts of aid, on th scale of the postwar Marshall Plan, might make a difference. But in terms of comparative U.S. gross domestic product, Marshall aid cost something near $500 million in 1997 money. In the absence of any Soviet-scale military threat, such an program is not politically feasible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there is no carrot at hand, there is a stick. The threat of withdrawing access to U.S. markets would be devastating for China's $50-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus, as it would for Mexico's $15 billion. But this would almost equally dismay U.S. corporations, which lobbied so hard for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and against Clinton's 1994 threat to suspend China's most-favored-nation <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> role. That is the catch with pluralist democracies: One's own nongovernmental interests have massive influence over policy-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. governments are thus stuck with the unimpressive tools of paltry carrots and feeble sticks as they seek to manage the most problematic and serious of their foreign relations: Russia's weakness, China's growth and Mexico's proximity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are policy options available at the margins, to seek to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with them on U.S. terms while insisting they accept the international rules on copyright and dumping, and try to strengthen the rules on labor and environmental standards. This will be slow, uphill work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can be made less painful if the Europeans, the global economy's biggest trading block, whose interests are similar, are enlisted into the common cause. They have been, to a large degree, in the case of Russia. They have yet to be rallied to join the giant task of steering China into civilized ways of behavior, and the prospects of their doing so are in question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Europeans were bullied into joining--reluctantly--the bailout of the Mexican peso. Their reward was to see their companies made vulnerable to sanctions in U.S. courts for affronting U.S. policy by trading with Cuba, under the Helms-Burton Act.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Europeans claim they are \"engaging\" with Cuba in order to pressure it to reform--precisely the policy Washington avows toward China, Russia and Mexico. And short of the laughable option of extending the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> embargo against Cuba to Russia, China and Mexico, there may be no other feasible course.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Martin Walker, a contributing editor to Opinion, is U.S. bureau chief of Britain's the Guardian, and author of \"The President We Deserve: Bill Clinton's Rise, Falls and Comebacks\" (Crown)</p>\n"}

The many economic groups that benefited from this strategy now form powerful political blocs, which have pushed for the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements Mexico has signed or is negotiating with its southern neighbors and the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though there are some political groups that claim that export-led growth has not benefited the majority of Mexicans, almost everyone recognizes that the 1994-95 crash would have been much worse and the recovery slower without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. However, even the clear success of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has not weakened the traditional reluctance of Mexico to strengthen its ties with the United States. The U.S. is still considered the \"dangerous giant of the North\" whose \"every cold becomes pneumonia in Mexico.\" Thus the geopolitical desire to establish free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with other countries. Mexico's long and traumatic history with the U.S. requires building checks and balances to its enormous power. Mexico has finally resolved to work to sustain economic growth and achieve social justice but, at the same time, continue to build new bridges with other countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the amount of wealth produced and the well-being of its people measure national success, Mexico has failed. In 1910, the year that the Mexican Revolution began, the per capita income of Mexicans was 27% of that of the Americans. However, 120 years before, Mexicans were enjoying the equivalent of 78% of U.S. per capita. Today, it has dropped to only 7%. Today, the number of Mexicans living under the poverty line (46 million) is three times that of the total population living in 1910.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The greatest part of the 19th century was catastrophic for Mexico. International wars and domestic revolutions plagued the country until 1876, when Porfirio Diaz became president of Mexico. Diaz was able to pacify the nation and began a slow process of national reconstruction. He successfully promoted economic growth through exports and foreign investment. However, the newly created wealth was not distributed among the population. A few families grew enormously wealthy while most Mexicans were barely able to survive, but Diaz's greatest failure was not preparing the country for an orderly process of succession.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This century has not been much better for Mexico. It has been able to sustain economic growth only during 40-odd years in that time. Its per capita income tripled in 100 years while that of other nations multiplied by seven, eight or even 20 times. Income distribution did improve from the late 1950s to the beginning of the crises of the 1980s, but since then it has greatly deteriorated. Now, Mexico is finally promoting a growth strategy that may prove successful in the long run.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The debt crisis of the 1980s forced the Mexican government to revise its growth strategy. In 1986, the nation took the first steps to open the until-then tightly closed economy. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari designed a new strategy for Mexico: economic growth led by exports. He began negotiations to achieve a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the United States and forcefully promoted its benefits inside Mexico. The pact was conceived to serve two main purposes: first, to open the U.S. economy to Mexican exports and second, to establish a credible and enforceable political mechanism to limit bureaucratic discretion in future economic policy decisions in Mexico. The authoritarian political system--without functioning checks and balances--was the real culprit of the recurring economic crises that had crippled Mexico's growth for so long.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems somewhat eerie that Mexico's successful growth during the Porfirio Diaz era in the latter part of the 19th century happened under policies similar to those now being tried. If those policies had not been interrupted after 1910, Mexico's per capita GDP perhaps would now be much larger. More and more Mexicans understand that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that the nation has signed or is in the process of constructing serve not only to build a robust economic growth strategy but also to build a political system that is not arbitrary and discretionary. With these political mechanisms in place, Mexico can hope to grow uninterruptedly in the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Roberto Blum is a professional associate with CIDAC, a Mexico City public policy think tank</p>\n"}
{"id": "2149555019.xml", "text": "<h2>Streetwise: Uncertainty Is Now a Better Bet</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Investors supposedly hate uncertainty, but the uncertainty of a 90-day delay to extra tariffs on China turned out to be better than the certainty of extra tariffs -- for a day. Stocks soared on Monday as markets welcomed the cease-fire over the weekend in the U.S.-China <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> spat, only to collapse on Tuesday as hope faded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The uncertainty is likely to keep hurting the world economy. Companies that were delaying investment decisions are hardly likely to put plans into action on the basis of a temporary truce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The different public announcements by the two sides should have given little confidence that there was a meeting of minds between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. When Mr. Trump labeled himself \"Tariff Man\" investors realized they may have been wrong to be so positive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Uncertainty may be part of the U.S. strategy. The theory is twofold. First, China is more reliant on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, so any damage to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will hurt the Chinese economy more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, investing in China is a bet on a rules-based global trading system that will protect extended supply chains. Bring that system into doubt and China becomes less attractive to businesses because of the risk of interruption to components or finished goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The flip side could be that uncertainty about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes investing in the U.S. more attractive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The theory here would be that the U.S. is the world's biggest consumer market and companies will want to produce closer to the final destination if they are concerned about global supply chains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Extra costs for components made in Ohio could be worthwhile for executives concerned that cheaper Chinese components might suddenly soar in price due to tariffs, or be hit by other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers slowing delivery times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steven Davis, professor of international business and economics at Chicago Booth, says there is little sign of extra investment so far. Jointly with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, he created a regular survey of business uncertainty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This summer Mr. Davis asked roughly 1,000 businesses about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and capital spending. Out of the one-fifth that had reassessed capital spending in light of tariffs, only one firm had increased spending at that point, with 14% accelerating existing plans. But 31% postponed or dropped previous plans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where the U.S. is certainly succeeding is in creating doubt about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules. An index of economic-policy uncertainty jointly created by Mr. Davis is at its highest level since just after Mr. Trump was elected. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-policy uncertainty gauge for the U.S. is close to the two-decade high reached this summer when North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement talks appeared in trouble. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> uncertainty within China is at a new high, according to an experimental index.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A strategy of deliberate uncertainty might be partially undermined by the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, also signed in Buenos Aires. The U.S. wanted this reworking of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to come with built-in uncertainty in the form of a five-year sunset clause, but that was extended to 16 years, probably long enough to ensure confidence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If companies do decide to relocate supply chains away from China, Canada and Mexico are now obvious alternatives to the U.S., with reliable market access and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, China is likely to suffer more than the U.S. both from tariffs and from doubts about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Davis says: \"They've optimized their economy for an environment where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> frictions are small and suddenly they're not going to be small.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, China being hurt more than the U.S. doesn't mean America isn't harmed -- or that China's Communist government will back down rather than accept weaker growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is beneficial because it allows a better use of resources, lowering costs and making consumers better off.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the beefs the U.S. has with China are broader concerns about state control, technology transfer and intellectual-property theft. However, adding uncertainty appears to go much further, fitting a worldview that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> isn't mutually beneficial, but must have a winner and a loser.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grabbing inward investment would be seen as winning, even if the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> strategy made Americans worse off overall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another part of the uncertainty is about whether the uncertainty itself remains a strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump made clear earlier this year that uncertainty was part of the approach to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation, saying he had no timeline for the talks because \"as long as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is in flux, no company is going to spend $1 billion to build an automobile plant.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The China talks have a similar approach by holding further tariffs in reserve (with yet more uncertainty about whether Mr. Trump was right when he tweeted that China would cut its retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-built cars).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, after all the uncertainty and bluster from the White House, the replacement for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't so very different from the previous version.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has concerns about geopolitical rivalry with China that aren't present with Canada or Mexico, so Mr. Trump may not accept a similar face-saving compromise with Beijing. Or he might.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one thing we can be sure of for a while is uncertainty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By James Mackintosh</p>\n"}
{"id": "398736655.xml", "text": "<h2>Choosing a Legacy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's see if we can connect some dots.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of President Clinton's few genuine legacies is passage in 1993 of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a reflection of way back when he was first running for President as a \"New\" Democrat, a species said to be attuned to the world's realities. Now, Mr. Clinton would like Congress to accord China what's called Permanent Normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Relations, thereby extending the grand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> legacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed the House with 102 Democratic votes. Guess how many of those pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Democrats are still in Congress. All of 34. Most haven't been replaced by \"New Democrats,\" which is to say by the moderate, sensible Democrats that party and press pundits promised we'd all get with Bill Clinton's ascendancy. The current Democratic caucus is 211-strong, and most tend toward the old pro-labor, tax-and-spend policies of their liberal forebears.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Right now, Bill Clinton is having a very hard time delivering enough of them to ensure passage of this pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> measure. Rep. Maxine Waters, who defended whatever was on offer for the President during the impeachment period, put it well: \"I'm sticking with my friends in organized labor.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, tying the dots together, the picture that emerges is Al Gore, the whatever-it-takes candidate (abruptly embracing permanent residency status for Elian Gonzalez), running as the titular leader of a congressional Democratic party that is moving steadily and inexorably back to liberal traditionalism. We hope that by November, self-styled New Democrats from Wall Street to Silicon Valley figure out what they're buying into -- a party whose model looks more like 1964 than 2000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's all playing out as a living tableau in the fight over the China vote. The measure's purpose is to give American companies the same opportunities to buy and sell in the emerging Chinese market as their competitors. Republican leaders signaled early on that the Clinton Administration would need to supply more than 70 votes from House Democrats to ensure passage. But support dwindled among the generally pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Republican ranks, and now that needed Democratic number has crept to 90. But every week brings news that more Democrats are jumping ship before the expected vote in May.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just last Thursday, 23 \"undecided\" Democrats announced they were throwing in with the anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc. Lest news accounts make them seem like utter reactionaries, their cover letter to the President made sure their opposition would be attributed to concerns about human rights and environmental issues in China. But on balance the Democrats have been surprisingly candid about their intentions here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With control of the House just a few seats away, Democrats have made it clear they aren't going to risk upsetting their wealthy allies in the labor movement with this vote. \"The president has thrown an apple of discord within the Democratic Party at a time when we are trying to win the House of Representatives,\" anti-China <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Rep. Nancy Pelosi told the Washington Post recently. \"We don't need to waste our energy on this at this point.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For anyone still able to be entertained by Bill Clinton's ability to play both ends against the middle, this one could be a perfect Clinton moment. By all accounts, the President is aggressively lobbying House Democrats for passage of permanent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-relations measure to ensure his internationalist legacy. Problem is, that conflicts with another brick in the legacy: regaining Democratic control of the House that voted to impeach him. It was in 1994, on Mr. Clinton's watch, that his party lost its four-decade-long majority in Congress. That prize will be won only with the active support of traditional liberal bastions like the big unions, with their political funds and get-out-the-vote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And thus we find the President choosing this moment to attend a mega-bucks fundraiser in South Carolina for Democratic Representative James Clyburn, an ardent protectionist and leader of the overwhelmingly anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Congressional Black Caucus. A presidential fundraiser is a big deal, but Mr. Clinton didn't seem to have in mind that this grand gesture should translate into Mr. Clyburn voting with him on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So what's it going to be? Will Bill Clinton be remembered as the President who cemented China into the world trading system? Or as the President of the party that tried to cut China out of the world trading system? In any event, while Mr. Clinton is off meditating on that, what will remain is a party far more liberal than the one he came in with. One way or another, that too is part of the legacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Don't Feed the Tiger\" -- WSJ April 19, 2000)</p>\n"}
{"id": "421878145.xml", "text": "<h2>THE NATION / THE RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE; NEWS ANALYSIS; A Two-Man Race Too Late for No. 2?; Edwards might have his wish for a one-on- one contest, but Kerry may already be out of reach. The challenger faces a tough Super Tuesday.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With his strong showing in Wisconsin, John Edwards has finally achieved what he has sought since the Iowa caucuses: a two-man race with front-runner John F. Kerry. But Edwards may have found his lane when Kerry is too near the finish line to catch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edwards' surprisingly close second-place finish on Tuesday guarantees he can continue his campaign at least through March 2, when 10 states -- including California, New York and Ohio -- will vote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Wisconsin results showed again that in states where Edwards has time to become known, he attracts moderates, independents and voters most concerned about the economy. And the North Carolina senator could benefit from increased media attention if Howard Dean quits the race after his distant third-place finish in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Edwards still must overcome enormous obstacles to seriously challenge Kerry who, after all, won Wisconsin and now has 15 victories in the 17 nominating contests so far.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not at all clear that this changes the central dynamic of the race, which is the inclination of Democratic voters to rally around Kerry as the presumptive nominee in the hopes of defeating President Bush,\" said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also working in Kerry's favor are the accelerated primary calendar, the breadth of support for the Massachusetts senator, the institutional party support gathering behind him and the rules of the nominating process -- which make it difficult to catch the candidate who amasses the most delegates early on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To overcome those advantages, Edwards probably must find much more cutting arguments against Kerry than he's unveiled so far. And even that could prove insufficient, especially because sharper attacks would provoke a backlash from some party leaders now backing Kerry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If Edwards actually wanted to compete for the nomination, he needed to start drawing a contrast with John Kerry a month ago,\" said Steve Murphy, campaign manager for Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt, who quit the race after finishing fourth in Iowa's Jan. 19 caucuses. \"Democrats are coalescing around John Kerry right now ... and they are eager to get onto the task of beating George Bush.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, fully four-fifths of the voters in Wisconsin said they would be satisfied if Kerry wins the nomination, according to the exit poll conducted by the National Election Pool. Kerry demonstrated similar strength on that question in earlier contests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That attitude underscores the largest challenge facing Edwards: identifying a constituency dissatisfied enough with Kerry to reconsider his nomination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not unusual for front-runners to hit a speed bump when they seem to have the nomination in hand: Buyer's remorse has become a common primary phenomenon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And candidates trying to recover from initial defeats, like Edwards, have been able to rebound only when they have been able to find arguments that shear large constituencies from the front- runner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not clear there is a significant pool of Democrats unhappy enough with Kerry to create such opportunities for Edwards. His most obvious target would seem blue-collar, non-college-educated voters sympathetic to his tough-on-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> message.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet targeting those voters won't be easy with organized labor putting its shoulder behind Kerry. On Tuesday, Kerry was endorsed at a raucous rally in Milwaukee by the coalition of industrial unions that had backed Gephardt. The AFL-CIO -- the union umbrella group that is the most powerful institutional force in the Democratic Party -- will join Kerry's forces on Thursday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I just don't see an opening on the populist, labor front for John Edwards,\" Murphy said. \"It's just too little, too late.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Wisconsin exit polling, Kerry fought Edwards to a virtual draw among the roughly three-fourths of voters who said they believed international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had cost more jobs than it created in the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The survey, conducted by Edison Media Research/Mitofsky International, a cooperative arrangement among the broadcast television networks, CNN and Associated Press, sampled 2,277 voters. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Edwards' showing among Wisconsin voters skeptical about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was an improvement for him; he ran behind those voters in last week's Virginia and Tennessee primaries. That suggested Edwards benefited in Wisconsin from more explicitly highlighting his disagreement with Kerry over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the result also indicated that Kerry's pledge to reassess <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and toughen labor and environmental standards in future agreements may be enough to blunt Edwards' escalating criticism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It's not about what [Kerry's] support was for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said after the rally endorsing Kerry. \"It's about what he is going to do in the future.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among Wisconsin voters, Edwards beat Kerry by double digits among voters whose principal concern was the economy, the exit poll found. Edwards also beat Kerry by 17 percentage points among voters who said the personal quality that mattered most in their decision was finding a candidate who cared about people like them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And while Kerry won comfortably among self-described Democrats, Edwards defeated him soundly among those who called themselves independents and Republicans (Wisconsin does not register voters by party). That result allowed Edwards to argue that the results showed he would make a stronger general election candidate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's difficult to win a party's nomination by relying primarily on support from voters who don't belong to it -- as Sen. John McCain of Arizona learned in the 2000 GOP race when his backing from independents and crossover Democrats was eventually overwhelmed by George W. Bush's overwhelming advantage among Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kerry continued to show the broad-based appeal that has characterized his dominance of the Democratic race. He ran well with liberals and tied with Edwards among moderates. His support varied only modestly between men and women.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Kerry romped among voters who said their highest priority was finding a candidate who can beat Bush. Those voters preferred Kerry over Edwards by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dean's distant third-place finish in a state once considered among his strongest put an exclamation point on the collapse of his candidacy. Dean ran behind Kerry and Edwards even among liberals and those who said they strongly disapproved of the war in Iraq.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the best news for Edwards in the exit poll was the finding that he soundly beat Kerry among voters who made the choice in the last week. That demonstrated Edwards' capacity to expand his support through extensive campaigning in a single state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with so many states voting on March 2, Edwards will be unable to devote as much attention to any of them. His campaign's hope is that increased media attention will compensate for that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Whenever you have a one-on-one kind of race, you get more attention,\" said David Axelrod, a senior advisor to Edwards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Edwards must overcome Democratic Party rules that guarantee delegates to any candidate who wins at least 15% of the vote in a primary or caucus. That makes it difficult to catch a front-runner, so long as his support doesn't completely collapse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Edwards' larger problem is that Kerry still won in Wisconsin. Always finishing second, as every Boston Red Sox fan knows, at some point looks less like a moral victory than a defeat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wisconsin exit poll</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What one candidate quality mattered most in deciding vote**</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Top three responses shown ** Top four responses shown Based on preliminary exit poll results.

{"id": "398336933.xml", "text": "<h2>A better U.S. target in Japan--the consumer</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the summit behind him, Kiichi Miyazawa has given Bill Clinton his best going-away present. He's told the president that Japan cannot accept Mickey Kantor's insistence on targets, but he has agreed to the growth of U.S. exports in Japan's market. Not a bad deal for the president, since export targets not only tend to become export ceilings, but would also have strengthened Japan's bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president can now move on to a new agenda, but he and his people are going to have to adopt a two-part strategy. First, they need to put away the bludgeon; all that does is confirm the deep fear of the Japanese that they are being victimized. Second, the U.S. will have to show that when we talk about a \"partnership\" we mean it. But that's going to require that the president's people do their homework on the real state of play in U.S.-Japanese <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Listening to the common wisdom that most of our top exports to Japan are raw materials -- such as maize, raw wood and fish -- won't do it. The reality is the opposite -- and has been for years. Easily 60% of our exports to Japan are manufactured goods, and most of them are of the hightech variety. The adjacent table shows the value of our top five exports through 1991, and in 1992 the top four categories were: $3.9 billion for transportation; $3.6 billion for office and automatic data processing equipment and parts; $2.6 billion for electrical machinery, and $2.4 billion for cork and wood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither will listening to those who insist on talking down the dollar. That policy has been tried since 1985. The result is that while the volume of Japan's oil imports rose by 26% compared with 1985, its bill last year for oil and related products was just 39% of its 1985 cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason: Oil is denominated in dollars. That means we've given Japan a huge discount on its commodity imports, and at the same time nearly doubled the cost to U.S. firms of doing business in Japan. And the high cost of setting up in Japan, rather than tariffs or closed markets, was listed by Americans there as the chief deterrent to greater U.S. investment and exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president has got it right in targeting the Japanese consumer. For the best part of a year, Japan's press has been carrying stories about the rigged bids in the construction business, Liberal Democratic Party ties to gangsters, and what brought it all out -- the gold bars in Shin Kanemaru's house. All this confirmed what ordinary folks had long suspected: They are being ripped off; the prices they pay are crazily high, compared with just about anywhere else. More and more Japanese see this firsthand, since 10 million to 15 million of them travel overseas each year, a third to the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had a good illustration when one of my wife's Japanese friends came to visit. The first place she wanted to see was the local Safeway: to confirm that a 20-pound bag of rice sells here for about $6 to $7, and not the $45 to $50 it brings in Japan. Sure, Japan's bubble has burst, but the U.S. has held its share of the Japanese market. Over the past two years, Japan's imports from the European Community dropped 10%, but from the U.S. hardly at all: Imports in 1990 were $52.4 billion; in 1992, $52.2 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, while the Japanese don't particularly welcome the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they understand the pressures behind it. But how can the U.S. seriously consider extending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Chile, and now to Argentina, when there are more attractive prospects in Asia? Singapore alone -- with just 2.8 million people -- buys more from the U.S. than those two, and South Korea and Taiwan add an additional $15 billion each.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every time the U.S. mentions Chile and Argentina as the next candidates for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- or worse yet inludes Singapore -- Japan begins to think about its trading partners in Asia. Unless Washington wants to promote a world of regional blocs, it needs to consider Korea, Taiwan and, yes, Japan in that format. Now that's a real eye-popper, designed to respond to Japan's new-found emphasis on reform and Bill Clinton's talk of a new agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gordon is a fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii and professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n"}

Mexico's meltdown a year after joining the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement shows that free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals alone don't guarantee stability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Central America faces a more daunting challenge than Mexico did a decade ago. The countries are far poorer, less educated and more lacking in infrastructure than Mexico. In Nicaragua, an impeachment drive has the pro-U.S. government teetering, with the socialist Sandinista party angling for a comeback. El Salvador and Honduras are struggling with violent international gangs, which may scare off potential investors. The Dominican Republic is just coming off a debt default with roots in a massive embezzlement scheme that brought down a major bank. Guatemala has a growing problem with narcotraffickers, while Costa Rica, long the star of the region, has balked at ratifying the deal as labor unions threaten paralyzing protests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Further lessening the region's appeal to international investors: Central America is fragmented by tedious and often inscrutable customs regulations, while inadequate ports and roads hobble access to U.S. markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> concessions can help fuel growth by opening the U.S. market to imports from poor nations. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> dismantled a number of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment barriers with Mexico. Automobile and auto-parts makers in Mexico were given a special status that enabled Mexico to become a major manufacturing center for the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gains helped Mexico triple its nonoil exports over the past decade, as foreign investment surged. Even so, Mexico's economy has languished in recent years as businesses in China and India emerged as fierce competitors for the U.S. market. Mexican economists argue that the country is backsliding because it failed to couple increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with reforms in such areas as education, health, courts and physical infrastructure in order to remain competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Central America slipping, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact could give the nations a big boost, but Cafta offers much less than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did. The deal mostly cements temporary <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> preferences Central American countries already have. Regional negotiators lacked the leverage to pry concessions from the U.S., so they won only limited gains in two areas where the region is strongest economically -- the sugar and garment industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAFTA LEAVES IN place a system of price supports for U.S. sugar producers, and allows Central Americans to export only a meager amount to the U.S. -- equivalent to about 1% of annual U.S. production. The Bush administration has offered even more protection to the sugar industry to win votes needed to pass the accord.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless, the administration and its Central American allies say the accord will boost investment in the region. They also warn that a failure of the U.S. Congress to approve Cafta could undermine leaders who have helped forge free-market democracies and who bet their political futures on tying the region closer to the U.S. As for providing additional help, Honduras and Nicaragua qualify for development assistance under the administration's Millennium Challenge Account -- although the other Central American nations don't yet qualify.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Cafta's immediate economic benefits are so \"nebulous\" says the economist Carl Ross, a Bear Stearns analyst, that he says he can't incorporate them into his forecasts for the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to promoting regional security through economic growth, the Europeans, looking for deeper economic integration, have adopted another model. The European Union offers its poorest entrants free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> coupled with development assistance, free movement of labor and other measures designed to lift nations out of poverty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When such poor nations as Ireland and Spain were admitted to the EU, they received funding aimed at boosting competitiveness and their workers were able to work elsewhere in wealthy Europe. Today, Ireland has one of the world's fastest growing economies and is competing on solid footing in high technology. The disposable income of Spanish families has risen by nearly 40% since 1998, estimates by Spain's La Caixa bank show.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta's limited <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> openings are unlikely to produce such dramatic gains.</p>\n"}

The AP obtained a 1,300-word memo describing the meeting that was written by a Canadian consulate official, Joseph DeMora.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an interview with the AP, Goolsbee contested a portion of the memo that quotes him as saying that campaign rhetoric \"that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy.\" He acknowledged telling the Canadians that Obama's position on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"is less about fundamentally changing the agreement and more in favor of strengthening/clarifying language on labor mobility and environment and trying to establish these as more 'core' principles of the agreement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DeMora's memo is more nuanced and subtle than the initial CTV report. Both the Canadian Embassy and the Obama campaign seized on the inaccuracies in the report to try to knock down the story. This is a classic news-management technique known as \"parsing\": Focus on a detail that you can safely say is untrue, aggressively deny it, and create the impression that the entire story is inaccurate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this case, the detail about the Obama staff member telephoning the Canadian ambassador in Washington was inaccurate. There was no contact between the embassy and the Obama campaign on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But the denials omitted an important part of the story: An Obama campaign staff member had discussed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with a senior Canadian diplomat. While a consulate general is a different entity from an embassy, they are both staffed by Canadian diplomats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama spokesman Bill Burton insisted yesterday that the campaign had not misled reporters. He said that Goolsbee, who serves as Obama's senior economic adviser, had gone to the Canadian consulate in Chicago for an \"informal\" meeting, rather than as an authorized emissary of the campaign. He said that there was \"nothing inconsistent\" between what Goolsbee told the Canadians privately and Obama's promises on the campaign trail to renegotiate the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bottom line is that it has taken four days to drag something approaching the full story out of the Canadian Embassy and the Obama campaign. As I suggested before, both Obama and his opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, have exaggerated their opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in order to win votes in economically depressed Ohio. This is a case where the technical parsing of the truth by the Obama campaign falls well short of the whole truth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two Pinocchios.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ONE PINOCCHIO: Some shading of the facts. TWO PINOCCHIOS: Significant omissions or exaggerations. THREE PINOCCHIOS: Significant factual errors. FOUR PINOCCHIOS: Real whoppers. THE GEPPETTO CHECK MARK: Statements and claims contain the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p>\n"}

But given a detailed public allegation last weekend from an archbishop in the church that the Pope ignored evidence of sexual abuse by a cardinal, the spiritual leader of more than one billion people perhaps owes his flock at least an explanation. So far, they're still waiting for one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answering the allegation has perhaps become more urgent today given the latest news on the abuse scandal in the United States.

Rocca reports</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>in the Journal:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Archbishop Vigan\u00f2, a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S., published a letter</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>over the weekend charging that the pope knew as early as 2013 about sexual misconduct by then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, whom the archbishop accused of sexual activity with seminarians and priests. The archbishop claimed that Pope Benedict XVI privately disciplined then-Cardinal McCarrick as early as 2009, but that the cardinal openly flouted the papal sanctions. Pope Francis knew of the cardinal's record yet restored him to a position of high influence in the U.S. church, the archbishop wrote.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In July, now-Archbishop McCarrick became the first man in nearly a century to resign as a cardinal, after a church investigation found credible a separate accusation: that he had sexually abused a teenager nearly 50 years earlier. The former cardinal has said he can't recall the incident with the teenager. His lawyer said on Sunday that he deserves due process with regard to the fresh allegations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pope Francis told reporters on Sunday night that he wouldn't respond to Archbishop Vigan\u00f2's accusations, thus ensuring that the controversy would persist.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Media attention has focused on whether the archbishop has an agenda, but it seems the more important question is whether his story is true. George Weigel, author of a two-volume biography of Pope St. John Paul II, reports</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>at First Things that he \"knew Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 well during his service as papal representative in Washington.\" Mr. Weigel calls the cleric an honest and \"courageous reformer\" who has battled corruption in the church. Mr. Weigel writes:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Church's current crisis is a crisis of fidelity and a crisis of holiness, a crisis of infidelity and a crisis of sin. It is also a crisis of evangelization, for shepherds without credibility impede the proclamation of the Gospel--which, as the other headlines of the day suggest, the world badly needs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his letter last weekend, Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 pleaded for transparency:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia. \"Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops\" (Lk. 12:3).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a statement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>released by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the conference's president, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of the archdiocese of Galveston-Houston says:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The recent letter of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 brings particular focus and urgency to this examination. The questions raised deserve answers that are conclusive and based on evidence. Without those answers, innocent men may be tainted by false accusation and the guilty may be left to repeat sins of the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a Los Angeles Times opinion piece titled, \"The pope's 'no comment' on sexual abuse cover-up allegations isn't good enough,\" Michael McGough writes</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if you believe that the pope's conservative critics are exploiting the abuse scandal to undermine Francis for other reasons, and that the Vigano letter is a volley in the intra-Catholic culture wars, the pope can't continue to decline comment on its central accusations. Was he informed of McCarrick's history? Did he know that Benedict had attempted to rein in the retired cardinal? Did he sound an \"all clear\"? At some point Francis does need to say a single word about these questions: \"yes\" or \"no.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No doubt many in his flock are eager for an answer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Other News</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NPR's program \"Morning Edition\" reported Monday on \"The School Shootings That Weren't\":</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How many times per year does a gun go off in an American school?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We should know.

{"id": "421189542.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD; TRADE; NAFTA Is Not Nirvana</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The success of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has sparked much talk about expanding the accord to include other nations in the hemisphere. President Bill Clinton has embraced the cause and is urging the U.S. Congress to grant him fast-track authority to negotiate hemispheric-wide free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Foremost among the countries mentioned as candidates for membership in a bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is Chile. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, in its current form, is not a suitable home for Chile, and may offer few significant advantages to other potential members as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accord has certainly worked for Mexico, Canada and the United States. But this is because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was tailor-made to affirm and build upon a pre-existing economic condition. It consolidated what was already free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Canada, and rewarded growing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in specific industries between America and Mexico. The main players in these industries are multinational corporations investing worldwide but operating in markets where competition is controlled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is thus natural that when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was shaped, these corporations sought not only to validate a regime of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and ensure unfettered capital mobility within the region, but also to create specific restrictions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with nonmember countries. In short, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, like most commercial accords, is a restrictive agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> flows reflect just how integrated the economies of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> signatories are. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is chiefly driven by investment and this investment, in turn, is influenced by transportation costs and physical proximity. Certain manufacturing plants are interlocked and interdependent, which increases overall efficiency and reduces costs. This is why <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has grown much faster in such industries as automobiles, electronics, office equipment and other high-tech engineering than in nonintegrated sectors, including those with strong comparative advantages like oil or minerals. As long as its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> structure reflects the increasing importance of this integration, Mexico will stand by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the same reason, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is an agreement that places a higher premium on ensuring certain investment flows and nontariff restrictions than on reducing tariffs. North American investors, Mexicans included, want to prevent Asian or European producers from assembling their products in, say, Mexico with imported materials, then re-exporting the finished products to the North American market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico, which has greatly benefited from investments in the car industry, is thus in a position to become a regional producer for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but not a global one. This results from the accord's tough rule-of-origin provisions that discourage imports of key European or Japanese components that would enable these foreign producers to link their Mexican assembly plants to their home companies. In textiles, too, regional protection may enable Mexico someday to displace Asian producers in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> market. In the case of agriculture and beef, the Mexican market is practically reserved for U.S. and Canadian producers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico probably had good reasons for accepting these kinds of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-offs because 70% of its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is with North America, and 80% of its foreign direct investment is similarly from this region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not an economic situation in which Chile would thrive. Chile liberalized its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment policies long ago. Unlike Mexico's, its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is evenly distributed among the world's major economic blocs. If Chile were to become a member of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it would have to accept the agreement's existing restrictions and most likely the environmental and labor agreements that were tailored to Mexico's situation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to some Chileans, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> exerts a strong attraction based on the belief that it is a high-fliers' club. But surely <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> lost some luster following the Mexican peso crisis in late 1994, and why would Chile need to join this club when its structural reforms have been much more thorough than Mexico's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is maturing while Chile and others wait for the green light to enter. After the peso crisis in December 1994, Mexico unilaterally opened up its gas distribution to foreigners and allowed foreigners a much larger percentage of ownership in its banking system. These changes were not formally appended to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but since they were sectors in which the Mexicans fought hard to limit foreign participation, they must now be considered a part of the regime that Chile would have to accept. Thus, to new members anxious about linking themselves to a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc that is already in operation, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has, in fact, become a moving target.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the hemisphere has a great future irrespective of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Countries should join trading blocs for economic reasons, not political ones. Unless Chile can be assured of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> free of the restrictions that apply to Mexico, it will be better off staying out. Its best policy would be continuing to remove barriers to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> without expecting great reciprocity. Chile, furthermore, would be better off attracting foreign direct investment from any country and using it to transform itself into an authentic global producer. The alternative--to redraft the agreement in order to accommodate Chile--is not realistic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is today a freer-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> region than envisioned in January 1994, because an economic crisis forced the Mexican government to liberalize more sectors than it had originally intended. This proves that regional agreements can evolve into larger trading zones, at which point it would be wiser for more liberalized economies to join up. Politicians like Clinton may find many arguments to deny the restrictive nature of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> or to argue that the agreement must be broadened because the politics are now right. They may even waste more time debating fast track as the quickest route to hemispheric nirvana. But, truth be told, the economics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> do not currently justify its expansion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (...), BARBARA CUMMINGS / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Rogelio Ramirez de la O is director general of Ecanal, an economic consulting firm</p>\n"}

It\u2019s a set of modest revisions to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \u2014 the old deal \u2014 and President Trump is exaggerating their significance so he can claim to have replaced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cI made a wonderful new sandwich by adding Lettuce and Tomato to Bacon and some bread,\u201d the historian Kevin Kruse tweeted . \u201cI\u2019m calling it the LTB!\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And what about the modest revisions to the deal? They\u2019re a mix of good and bad, as Matthew Yglesias of Vox notes . The bad include changes that make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> more bureaucratically cumbersome. The deal expands some needlessly complex patent rules. It also has a version of a sunset clause, which may force future rounds of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, as Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas and Mariano S\u00e1nchez-Talanquer explain in The Times .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good include changes to automobile-industry rules that could shift more manufacturing to higher-wage factories, which could help workers. Unfortunately, those new automobile rules also are an example of a widespread problem with economic policy: They do not include inflation adjustments. This sounds like a wonky issue, I realize, but it\u2019s actually a big deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When a policy doesn\u2019t adjust for inflation, it often builds in its own effective demise.

In the case of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0, the deal calls for a larger share of auto jobs to be in factories that pay production workers at least $16 an hour.

Gallup scored audience reaction as almost 2-to-1 for Gore, and two members of my own focus group showed why: \"The old guy was mean to him,\" said one; her husband said of Perot: \"He wants everybody to listen to him, but he don't listen to nobody.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Was this event an elucidation of the issue of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> versus protectionism? Of course not; the scrap taking place in the arena of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has little to do with foreign economic policy. It is the old grudge fight between the politics of hope against the politics of fear (as the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs put it) or the cultural elite against the pee-pul (as the protectionists put it).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the Clinton decision to have his Vice President take on Perot was a media masterstroke. Last year, both parties abased themselves polishing the independent's apple. This year, at little political risk (a buildup of the Perot candidacy would cut primarily into any Republican challenger's votes) the President saw how to dramatize a dull issue -- by anointing one volatile villain as spokesman for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s opposition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot stepped eagerly into the trap of Larry King's unstructured debate. His \"are you gonna keep interrupting me?\" technique works well with journalists, but backfires when used against another politician, especially one who can strike a deferential pose.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House strategy was to provoke Perot into blowing his cool, into getting visibly mean and verbally abusive when cornered. Gore's tool in peeling off the veneer of folksiness was an accusation of hypocrisy: since Perot personally profited from his land around a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone near Mexico, why did the billionaire oppose everybody else getting the same free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> break?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That threw him on the defensive. In truth, Perot is not in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opposition for the money he can make; he's only in it for the power he can grab. But the charge of financial hypocrisy rattles him because it undermines his appeal to populist resentment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Perot launched his customary attack on lobbyists, Gore landed the counterpunch related to that conflict of interest: \"I served in the Congress,\" said Gore, \"and I don't know of any single individual who lobbied the Congress more than you did . . . to get tax breaks for your companies.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"You're lying,\" Perot sputtered. \"You're lying, now.\" But the fact is that he has lobbied government at all levels all his business life for contracts and special favors, with great success. Vulnerable to this counterpunch, Perot lost control and hurled the word \"lying\" twice at the Vice President, the cry of the stymied debater.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Perot expressed his usual scorn at government forecasts, Gore lowered the boom: \"When the war against Iraq was about to take place, you told Larry King 'this is a terrible mistake and it'll lead to the death of 40,000 American troops.' \" Same with a wild Perot prediction that 100 banks would fail after Election Day. Irrelevant to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? Yes -- but right on target against \"the politics of negativism and fear.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout the show, Perot left the impression of a man whining about the interruptions of his interruptions: \"I would like to finish a sentence just once before the program's over . . . let's have an unnatural event and try not to interrupt me. . . . Are you going to listen? Work on it. . . .\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gore's red cape enticed Perot into insulting charges and insolent digs, which Americans recognize as a symptom of blown cool. \"Would you even know the truth if you saw it? I don't believe you would. . . . Give me your whole mind. . . .\" The effect of this uncontrolled contempt was heightened by the matador's studied, boy-scout respectfulness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The depressingly sincere Vice President is not the best formal debater around; I thought Dan Quayle edged him last year. But in this performance, Gore proved that a politician armed with courage and civility can beat a bully every time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot's insistent message through his exercise in self-revealing self-destruction was \"Let me finish.\" Let's hope he has.</p>\n"}

The United States, on the other hand, blessed with two stable and peaceful neighbors, has no need for such a tight regional alliance. Or does it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The meeting last week among the three North American leaders -- President Bush, President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada -- at Mr. Bush's Texas ranch may have represented the beginning of serious discussion of that question. In their joint statement, the participants said their goal was a ''security and prosperity partnership'' for the continent. This shows a recognition that an absence of military conflict is not a good enough reason to avoid tighter regional alliances, particularly in a globalizing world where competition comes not only from other nations, but increasingly from other blocs of countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The idea that political stability could be a building block of economic prosperity and improved quality of life was something that Jean Monnet, the architect of the European Union, understood when he brought his long-term vision out of the ashes of a bitter war. And in 50 years, what was once simply a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area has turned into a real political community, fostering peace and advancing the economic development of all its members.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time North Americans got serious about even limited continental cooperation, at the end of the cold war, it was enough to think solely in economic terms. Thus the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement seemed sufficient to bring about prosperity and draw our countries closer together. But 11 years after it came into effect, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is clearly an insufficient response to the 9/11 attacks, the strengthening of the euro, the rise of China as an economic and political power, and many other major challenges. We need to shut off the automatic pilot under which the countries of North America have been flying for the last decade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must move beyond just managing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and into constructing a new relationship that has four principal goals: enhancing security cooperation; further strengthening economic ties; closing Mexico's development gap; and, certain to be the most controversial, building an institutional architecture to bring a North American community closer to reality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, security: the attacks of Sept. 11 and the rise of global terrorism show the need for a safety perimeter around the continent. The Mexican and the United States governments are deeply troubled by intelligence reports that Al Qaeda might be laying plans for an attack across America's southern border. But simply putting more guards and towers in the Arizona desert won't keep America safe. In place of the inefficient borders between the countries today, we need a policy on a strong external continental border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each country would of course keep sovereignty over the edges of its own territory, but each would have to meet border security requirements agreed upon by all three parties to ensure there are no weak links. This wall around the continent would, in turn, allow us to make internal North American crossings more flexible; the European model, with its uniform visa requirements, is worth following.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for the economic cooperation, we've come a long way thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Nevertheless there are obvious points of contention -- that trucks loaded in Mexico cannot be driven in the United States, that Canada cannot export soft lumber to the United States, and that Mexico will not accept fructose from the United States. Not only must we resolve these disagreements, we must find also a way to compete and win against both China and Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A good starting point would be a shared customs union, with the three countries setting tariff policies in conjunction and protecting each other from improper <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices by the rest of the world. In addition, the cumbersome ''rules of origin'' laws that affect products made in North America with parts made elsewhere should be thrown out the window.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All three partners would gain by closing Mexico's development gap. Clearly Mexico itself must undertake reforms in terms of its energy, fiscal and labor policies (opening its oil industry to foreign investment is an obvious start). But we need help. The poorer nations of Europe benefited for years from compensation funds -- money given by the rich countries to be spent on roads, electricity grids, modernized farms and factories -- that enabled countries like Ireland, Spain and Greece to join the 20th century. Now those former poor relations are important exporters and markets for their European neighbors, and their most enterprising workers are no longer desperate to emigrate. Following the European model would eventually give Canada and the United States a better trading partner to the south, and a more prosperous Mexico would result in less illegal immigration, making cooperation on border security more practical.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the key to achieving all these goals is creating permanent three-party institutions. Meetings like the one last week should be made annual, and the nations' defense, justice and intelligence chiefs should also meet every year to develop a common plan to fight terrorism, drug trafficking and immigrant smuggling. In time, the idea would be to create a permanent North American commission with cabinet-level representatives from each country; it would be charged not only with firming up nuts-and-bolts agreements on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and security, but also with working toward an eventual goal of a true North American union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undoubtedly, this level of cooperation would be a hard sell to Americans, who would assume they would have the most to lose. But simply maintaining the status quo will not help the United States maintain its dominance in a changing world. Just as the Bush administration has articulated a radical strategy of military pre-emption in its national security strategy, it needs a similarly bold approach for defending the country's economic future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe, just maybe, the men gathered at the Crawford ranch could some day be seen as the Jean Monnets of their age, the founding fathers of the North American Community.</p>\n"}

Polls suggest at least an even chance that the separatist side could win a narrow majority in today's referendum. Americans and their Government are duty bound to respect whatever Quebecers democratically decide and try to make it work for the best. But there is no mistaking Washington's strong preference for continued Canadian unity. Separation could complicate economic, political and human relations across the St. Lawrence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Quebecers have a genuine grievance -- a sharp loss of constitutional status over the past decade and a half -- that has never been satisfactorily resolved.  Canada was shaped by the 18th-century conquest and absorption of the French colony of Quebec into the British Empire. British rule recognized the special linguistic and cultural status of Quebec, and the province carried a weight in independent Canada's affairs well beyond its 25 percent of the country's population.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when Canada established a fully sovereign Constitution in 1982, Quebec's legal status reverted to being just one out of ten Canadian provinces. Agreements promoted by Ottawa since then to legally enshrine a special status for Quebec have been repeatedly rejected by English-speaking Canada. These rejections have allowed Quebec's separatist party, which decisively lost a referendum on sovereignty in 1980, to return to power last year and launch a new referendum campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However legitimate Quebec's constitutional grievance, independence is a risky path. Polls showed Quebec's voters soundly rejecting it until the separatist campaign took a new tack several weeks ago. Under the leadership of Lucien Bouchard, the separatists began putting less emphasis on Quebec sovereignty and  more on their desire for continued close economic and political links with Canada. They talk about an independent Quebec that would continue to use the Canadian dollar and automatically remain part of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That position has picked up votes from Quebecers who still hope for the kind  of constitutional solution rejected by Canadian voters in the past. Mr. Bouchard has recently seemed to suggest that a yes vote in the referendum could so strengthen Quebec's bargaining position with Ottawa on constitutional issues that formal separation might even become irrelevant. But whatever the outcome of the referendum, the problem of convincing the rest of Canada to accept a special constitutional status for Quebec will remain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> presents different problems. The free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement has strengthened  the Quebec economy, and Quebecers are strong <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporters. But despite Mr. Bouchard's assurances, the status of an independent Quebec in the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement would have to be negotiated and approved by the other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners -- Canada, Mexico and the United States. Quite apart from Ottawa's possible objections, few United States supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are eager to see Congressional debate on the treaty reopened in today's Washington political atmosphere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Logically, the common interests Quebec shares with Canada and its other partners should drive all parties to work out smooth new arrangements. But much  unhappy history has taught that when questions of national identity come into play, logic is no guarantee of harmonious relations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada needs to renew its constitutional discussions with Quebec.

{"id": "2036663327.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Trade Threats Are Hurting Growth</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economic uncertainty and prosperity are sworn enemies -- when uncertainty reigns, prosperity fades. Uncertainty undermines prosperity by sapping investor and consumer confidence, choking off private investment, and suppressing consumer spending. The depression that followed the 1929 crash and the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis are called \"great\" not only because of the magnitude of the downturns, but also because the economic uncertainty that followed produced the weakest recoveries of the past century. Today, the Trump administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies have increased economic uncertainty to a level that threatens to bring back the stagnation of the Obama years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Eight stagnant years after the 1929 downturn, the great American manufacturer Lammot du Pont II identified the cause. \"Uncertainty rules the tax situation, the labor situation, the monetary situation,\" he said, along with \"practically every legal condition under which industry must operate.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This evaluation was borne out by a 2016 study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, which found that economic uncertainty peaked in the 1930s. As government increasingly dominated the economy in an effort to control prices and wages, the American recovery lagged behind every other developed country except France. In its 1938 yearbook, the League of Nations implicated policy uncertainty as the cause of U.S. stagnation: \"Uneasiness accentuated the unwillingness of private enterprise to embark on further projects of capital expenditure which might have helped to sustain the economy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second-highest level of economic uncertainty since 1900 occurred during the 2008 subprime crisis and the subsequent failed recovery. When the recession ended in mid-2009, the Obama administration predicted six years of 3.9% average real growth -- a reasonable expectation, since strong recoveries had followed every previous significant postwar recession.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as President Obama expanded government control over the American economy -- through laws like Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act, regulations, executive orders and agency guidance -- a tidal wave of red tape spread across health care, financial services, energy, manufacturing and even the internet. With the rule of law replaced by regulatory decisions, vast sectors of the economy lost a predictable business environment and economic uncertainty soared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Investment atrophied as private fixed investment fell to just over a third of its historical norm for the postwar era. With the investment drought, productivity and wage growth plummeted. Uncertainty kept the economy in a stupor, holding average economic growth during the recovery to a mere 2.1% -- barely half the level projected at the start of the recovery.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In America's most dramatic deregulatory effort, the Trump administration and Congress have repealed, revised or stopped more than 1,000 regulations, reversing much of the political uncertainty produced by Mr. Obama's onslaught. The economy quickly revived, averaging 3.1% real growth in the first three quarters of the Trump presidency -- almost 50% higher than the average under Mr. Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress and the president further strengthened the recovery by enacting tax reform, which has spurred additional business investment. But today the administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is beginning to create a level of uncertainty that could imperil the recovery.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House dismisses concerns about its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> actions, claiming aggregate tariffs are too small to do much harm. In reality, it is virtually impossible to calculate even the primary effects the Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies will produce as they ripple through the economy. The subsequent effects that would come from escalating retaliation are unknowable. Mr. Trump's threats to terminate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement create massive uncertainty by jeopardizing the North American export chain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one knows which U.S. exports retaliating nations might penalize, so the stifling effects of uncertainty permeate a broad cross-section of the economy. For commodities already targeted for retaliation, the effects of uncertainty have begun to appear. How many soybean farmers are investing in farm equipment today? President Trump recognized that his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is creating debilitating uncertainty overseas when he claimed that now \"nobody's going to build billion-dollar plants in Mexico.\" But he fails to see that the same logic applies to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-related investments in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Uncertainty about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy lowers the value of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-related plant and equipment in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries. Since U.S. investors own more than $90 billion of investments in Mexico and more than $350 billion of investments in Canada, the destruction of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would wreak havoc on U.S. pension funds and other equity investments by destroying capital values in the U.S. and across North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The University of Michigan's April consumer-sentiment survey noted that respondents who mentioned the tax cuts expressed high confidence in the economy, while those who mentioned tariffs expressed low confidence. The Institute for Supply Management recorded the largest drop in its manufacturing index since 2015, with more than a third of respondents citing tariffs as a source of their worries. Economists Scott Baker, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis -- authors of the study that measured Depression-era uncertainty -- have found that economic uncertainty related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> this March was more than five times as great as the pre-election average for 2016.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tariffs proposed by the White House may be the president's real policy or bargaining chips in his negotiating strategy. In either case, the posturing needs to end and the policy making needs to begin. The uncertainty generated by the administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> threats is beginning to corrode the recovery. If the final policy reduces <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and export subsidies, America and the world will benefit. If the policy reduces <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, America and the world will lose, but at least the new landscape will be known. Uncertainty will be reduced and the economy will be able to find its way forward.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gramm, a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

{"id": "408672814.xml", "text": "<h2>How to Wreck Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ONE LESSON of the recent protests against globalization is that, rightly or wrongly, international institutions are viewed as secretive, and over-solicitous of business interests and therefore illegitimate. At a meeting that starts Monday in Dallas, the Canadian, U.S. and Mexican governments are in danger of ignoring that lesson. Prompted mainly by Canada, they are considering measures that could weaken the environmental side agreement that was negotiated as part of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. This would make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> appear more pro-business and more secretive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has created wealth by freeing businesses to set up factories and market goods wherever they deem most efficient; it has contributed to, among other things, an export- led Mexican economy that has grown 8 percent in the past year. Unlike most <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, however, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> balances this constructive boost for business with some protections for labor and the environment. The labor side agreement has been modestly useful; in one case it helped to pressure the Mexican government to enforce its own law on pregnant workers. Meanwhile the Commission for Environmental Cooperation has helped to coordinate the three countries' environmental policies and has provided nongovernmental organizations with a forum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The governments may now weaken this forum. At present, anyone who thinks that an environmental law is not being enforced can petition the commission. If staff experts think the complaint is serious, they ask the three governments for permission to investigate; once the investigation is completed, they can only publish the fruits of their fact finding if two out of three countries vote to allow them to do so. That process may sound rather government-controlled already. But Canada is pushing ideas that might strengthen that bias by allowing governments to intervene in the experts' fact-finding work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Canadians protest that this is not their intention, though they admit that they are unhappy with the way the process now works. Whatever their real intentions, it is important that all three governments be clear on the stakes here. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the only <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that gives citizens a right to have their views heard. It is a modest right: The fact-finding reports have no power to compel governments to enforce their own laws, serving only to shed light on abuses. Any government that weakens this mild concession to anti- globalization feeling will be guilty of inciting more anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protest.</p>\n"}

Instead, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump blame too much economic freedom for the malaise. This is troubling no matter who wins the election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In three days visiting this resort town last week, I did not meet one person in the local hospitality industry who was born here.

It's how economies grow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet our political class and intellectuals increasingly point to these developments--technology, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and migration--as reasons for pessimism. It is worrisome logic because it suggests that a better future depends on going backward, against the grain of economic liberalism. It also ignores the Fed's culpability for slow growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Innovation and competition generate what Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction.\" In a free market with sound money, the wealth created by disruption is redeployed, providing opportunities for those who were displaced. This boosts productivity further.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fed policies of zero interest rates and bond buying--quantitative easing--have not only failed to stimulate business investment. They have discouraged it through the misallocation of capital. This is contractionary because it starves entrepreneurship and thus productivity growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) opened the Mexican economy to Canadian and U.S. imports in 1994. Many Mexicans lost jobs. Yet the country gained access to what it needed to modernize. Running water, salmon entrees, California wines and air conditioning were not standard fare here on the Mayan Riviera in 1985. They are now, and tourism has boomed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talk about the need for faster U.S. growth. Yet both propose to get there by cracking down on free markets. Both prescribe new restrictions on international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and a new entitlement program for preschool children.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton wants government to take a bigger tax bite from the most productive members of society, a policy that would discourage risk-taking by those same individuals. Mr. Trump demagogues immigration and wants to punish U.S. companies that allocate capital to its highest use if that happens to be abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Left out of their analyses is the gargantuan role of the Federal Reserve's antigrowth monetary and regulatory policies. Mr. Trump argued in September that the Fed's eight-year policy of cheap credit is generating asset bubbles. But if he understood the problem he wouldn't rail against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton feigns alarm at Mr. Trump's criticism of the Fed on grounds that the central bank is supposed to be independent. Yet it is well known that Democrats are working behind the scenes to weaken the independence of the regional Fed banks to centralize power in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conventional wisdom holds that the Fed has flooded the market with credit by aggressively buying bonds and creating bank reserves on the Fed balance sheet. Yet when the Fed buys assets--such as government debt or mortgage-backed securities--it only records a short-term liability on the balance sheet. The reserves are on the books but don't create any more credit in the real economy than if the Fed never made the purchase. Meanwhile it creates shortages of medium- and long-term assets in the market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there were a glut of credit in the real economy it would likely show up in bank lending as expanding businesses clamored for low-cost loans. Yet credit growth \"has been dismally slow,\" wrote David Malpass, president of the consulting firm Encima Global in a recent note to clients. The term structure of bank assets is partly to blame, but so is regulation--by the Fed and Congress, via 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation--which has made it difficult to lend to businesses, especially small ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most creditworthy companies are using cheap money not in productivity-increasing ventures but to pay dividends, buy back stock or engage in other financial transactions. Fed policies, as Mr. Malpass wrote, are \"reducing the credit available to smaller businesses and hurting GDP growth rather than stimulating it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Fed is technically an \"independent agency\" but it is not unanswerable to the public it serves.

{"id": "398349699.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Nafta: Part of the trade-environment solution</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the window of a light aircraft a mile above the Yucatan peninsula, what may be the first environmental effects of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement appear on the landscape below. Orange groves, planted in anticipation of expanding U.S. citrus markets, threaten native forests and the diversity of species that depend upon them. Nevertheless, despite free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s potentially far-reaching environmental impacts, opposition to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may not be an effective way to deal with them. It may, in fact, be counterproductive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a political issue has been highly absorbing for the environmental community. Although assessments of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact very widely, environmentalists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is not something they can afford to ignore. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-driven flows of capital and patterns of resource consumption affect virtually every facet of the environment. As a result, many of the conservation gains of the past two decades could be lost to even small shifts in international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's timber industry provides a good case study. In the country's southeastern region, a number of small-scale, community-run operations manage broad tracts of native forest under a conservation model. While these operations protect a wealth of species and ecological functions, they operate in the economic margin and are endangered by shifting terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As tariffs decline, these operations are at economic risk from timber industries in the U.S. and Canada. To minimize market losses, forest producers in Mexico face increasing pressure to cut more trees and concentrate operations in scarce old-growth forests where they can obtain the highest-value timber. The environmental cost of competing with the U.S. timber industry is simply too great. And, as is occurring now in the Yucatan, pressure to convert land to citrus and beef for American markets may accelerate forest loss.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The forest-into-citrus scenario is instructive for several reasons. First, it shows that the environmental impacts of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> may be felt far beyond the highly-polluted border area which has so preoccupied U.S. environmental groups. Second, it demonstrates that enforcement of U.S.-style laws in Mexico is not a magic solution; <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment effects are too diffuse, often lying beyond the reach of existing legal regimes. Finally, it lends some needed perspective to the claim that U.S. industry standards for environmental protection are always superior to Mexican standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To the contrary, Mexican small-scale forestry operations are ecologically preferable to single-species tree plantations in the U.S. that support comparatively little wildlife. This last point deserves mention in the U.S. environment-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate, which has too often digressed into a nationalist -- sometimes protectionist -- dialogue, with inadequate appreciation of the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by Mexico. The real situation is likely to be much less one-sided, with impacts, good and bad, on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, if forest loss in Mexico is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> outcome, why should an environmental group support <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? The answer lies in the fact that the changes that many fear will ensue as a result of the treaty are happening already, even without a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. Mexican timber producers are under pressure now from increasing imports of cheaper American wood, as a result of tariff reductions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. Furthermore, land has been cleared along its Gulf coast since the 1980s for citrus exports under a more liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> regime in that sector. Much the same can be said about the maquiladora factories that line the heavily-polluted border region; they, too, have flourished without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we are serious about addressing these and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-environment impacts we must work to reform the economic forces behind them, and we must do so at the international level. But while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements are a logical point to confront our economic and environmental contradictions, they are not, strictly speaking, the cause of them. This should lead environmentalists to ask: If blocking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will not stem the environmental impacts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, can it provide the basis for beginning to resolve them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps it can. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents often assert that an increase in financial resources flowing to Mexico will raise its environmental protection standard. Indeed it is widely recognized that poverty leads to degradation of the natural environment. While increasing financial resources alone does not guarantee a cleaner environment, it at least provides an opportunity to pursue one-given sufficient political will.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fortunately, in Mexico the political will is strong. The environmental record of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been justifiably commended for its effort to harmonize environmental standards, and to enforce them more evenly. No administration in recent history has taken, at the highest levels, bolder steps for the conservation of Mexico's rich biological diversity. The receptiveness of the Mexican government to environmental concerns is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose, if we truly care about the future of environments outside our own borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How good is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the environment? It has been called \"the greenest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement ever.\" While this may be true, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is silent on many key environmental issues, such as the environmental effects of commodity price shifts on land use and the like. These are questions that need to be addressed by all parties -- Canadians, Mexicans and U.S. officials -- in an open forum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key component of negotiations on a much-needed environmental side agreement for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is the creation of a special commission on the North American environment. An important role of the commission would be to monitor the effects of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in order to find cooperative solutions to environmental issues across the continent. That is not everything, but it is something essential for the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is accompanied by a strong environmental side agreement, it can provide the basis for long-term environmental improvements throughout North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Fuller is president of World Wildlife Fund.</p>\n"}

{"id": "1823795207.xml", "text": "<h2>What Mexico Could Do When Up Against Trump</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CORRECTION APPENDED. When Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, the Mexican secretary of the economy, came to talk to me last week about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the American elections, I didn't expect him to drag up the old spat between Mexico and the United States over trucks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back when it signed on to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement more than 20 years ago, the United States pledged that in the year 2000 it would lift restrictions that kept Mexican trucks from hauling cargo inside the United States, forcing them instead to dump their loads at the border. But when the time came, under pressure from the Teamsters and the union's allies in Congress, Washington backed out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico kept its cool for a while, though an arbitration panel in 2001 found the United States was in breach of the agreement. In 2007, Mexico accepted the George W. Bush administration's request to cooperate in a pilot program that allowed a few Mexican trucks over the border, to prove that the rigs and their drivers posed no undue safety threat to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when Congress cut funding for the pilot program two years later, Mexico said enough.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico slapped retaliatory tariffs, ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent, on a list of products that amounted to over $2 billion in American exports to Mexico. It included apples from Washington -- to help sway the views of Senator Patty Murray -- and Christmas trees from Oregon, the homeland of Senator Ron Wyden, another critic of the cross-border trucking deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure enough, common sense prevailed: On July 6, 2011, the two countries signed an agreement to allow Mexican trucks to operate in the United States. On Oct. 21, 2011, the first Mexican truck rumbled across, and the last retaliatory tariff was removed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few, if any, countries would be as vulnerable to a Trump presidency as Mexico. About $4 of every $5 worth of goods that Mexico exports come to the United States. Some 35 percent of Mexican jobs depend directly on foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's future relies on North American integration. \"That's Mexico's vulnerability,\" said Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. \"There is nothing more important in Mexico than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has already tripped over himself trying to deal with Donald J. Trump. Many Mexicans felt betrayed when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto invited Mr. Trump to a meeting in Mexico City, sending his low approval ratings plummeting further. And the meeting hardly improved relations. Hostilities broke out as soon as it was over.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The minister of the economy, Mr. Guajardo Villarreal, argues there is little point for Mexico to respond now to Mr. Trump's threats to wall off the Mexican people and slap a 35 percent tariff on Mexican imports. \"We must not overreact to campaign rhetoric,\" he told me. Still, the truck story suggests the Mexican government understands that it needs a contingency plan in case Mexico's most important partner on the world stage were to suddenly turn hostile.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The outline of a strategy seems clear: Mexico must communicate to the United States just how valuable their relationship is, and how self-destructive it could be to undermine it. The question is how to make this case. How persuasive can Mexico be?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A slide from a presentation that Mr. Guajardo Villarreal and his aides carry with them as they speak to American business and political leaders shows what the 2017 Ford Fusion, made in Hermosillo, in northern Mexico, would cost if a 35 percent tariff were imposed on imports from Mexico: $30,253, which is almost $8,000 more than it costs now. Another slide shows that eight of 10 avocados consumed in the United States are grown in Mexico, as are nine of 10 limes and half of all tomatoes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six million American jobs also depend on exports to Mexico, one slide says. Mexico buys nearly $250 billion worth of stuff from the United States. And 37 cents out of each dollar's worth of Mexican exports to the United States came from the United States in the form of parts and other components. \"If you throw obstacles at the relationship with Mexico, you would be shooting yourself in the foot,\" Mr. Guajardo Villarreal told me.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Allies in the United States would indeed help Mexico make its case, including states and municipalities that would be hurt by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s unraveling, and businesses that would be forced to relocate production and rethink their global supply chains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps a more muscular approach is needed. Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former Mexican foreign minister who is a harsh critic of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, suggests that Mexico's best argument is that the country's stability and prosperity are indispensable for the national security of the United States. Americans worried about illegal immigration across the southern border might stop to consider what it could look like if the Mexican economy went into a tailspin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this argument fails to persuade, Mr. Casta\u00f1eda argues, there are other tools in the toolbox. Say Mexico demanded that the United States prove that a migrant was Mexican before it would accept her back into the country. It could deploy American courts and regulations against Mr. Trump's wall, pushing for things like environmental impact assessments. \"We should throw as many monkey wrenches into the works as possible,\" Mr. Casta\u00f1eda said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And together with Canada, Mexico should sue in every court -- under the provisions of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the United States -- to resist Mr. Trump's protectionist agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A big question remains, however: If a Trump administration were to follow through on its threats -- breaking the rules of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the W.T.O. -- how strongly should Mexico retaliate?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has shown it knows how. In the truck spat, Mexico picked political targets skillfully. It avoided shooting itself in the foot when it retaliated against Christmas trees rather than car engines. \"Mexico has been very good at trying to follow the rules of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements when it has run into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> frictions with the United States,\" said Chad Bown, an expert on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, as Mr. Bown observed, in the early days of a Trump administration -- when he wouldn't be worried about re-election -- \"what products would you pick?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would certainly hurt the United States. Scholars at the Peterson Institute modeled what would happen if America were to slap sky-high tariffs on Mexico and China and they were to reply in kind: By 2019, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost output and would result in the loss of nearly 4.8 million private sector jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem for Mexico is that the damage to its own economy would be much larger. \"If we are to go to war, of course we have rifles,\" Mr. Rubio said. But the economic weapons his country has at its disposal, he added, are like \"nuclear bombs that you can't use.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lamenting their luck, Mexicans often say, \"Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.\" Facing the prospect of a Trump presidency, many Mexicans would hope their northern neighbor were farther away. But Mexico's prosperity depends on a closer relationship with the United States, not a weaker one. The best approach to a Trump administration may be to hunker down and wait for his successor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction:  September 29, 2016, Thursday</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Wednesday with the Economic Scene column, about how Mexico might handle a Trump presidency, misspelled the surname of Mexico's secretary of the economy in some editions.

{"id": "429366916.xml", "text": "<h2>Public & Private; Over and Out</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've got an idea for a modification to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement: we'll send Ross Perot to Mexico and in return we'll give the Mexicans anything they want as the gift of a grateful nation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Tuesday's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate with Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Perot's career as a pundit without portfolio -- and without specifics -- should be over for good. During that 90 minutes, in a charmless version of his old cracker-barrel act, dogs didn't hunt, lines in the sand were drawn and the tooth fairy was mentioned twice. \"It'll only take a minute to kill this snake.\" \"If you believe that, I got a lot of stuff in the attic I can sell you.\" You know. Ross Perot's easier to imitate than Jimmy Durante.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot had a purpose in American politics for a fleeting moment during the last Presidential election.  He said that the emperor had no clothes, that Washington was a hollow place that ran on incestuous connections among lobbyists, journalists, and elected and appointed officials.  While campaignspeak was filled with smoothie rhetoric, Mr. Perot's was filled with the kind of aphorisms you'd expect to find in a fortune cookie at a Tex-Mex restaurant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several things have happened since. One is that the choir learned the song. There's barely a person in America who doesn't suspect that Washington deal-making has as much to do with the public weal as a black widow spider has to do with romance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(That common understanding doesn't mean an end to politics as usual: on the same day that Ross and Al did Yosemite Sam and Crusader Rabbit, Ed Rollins, who managed Christine Todd Whitman's successful race for governor of New Jersey, boasted to reporters that the campaign paid black ministers and Democratic regulars not to rally voters for Jim Florio. Yesterday he retracted the story, leaving Mrs. Whitman fuming, the ministers raging and the rest of us scratching our heads.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Rollins, who parted bitterly with Mr. Perot after briefly managing his on-again, off-again Presidential race, ever wonders how the man could marshal so much support out of American disillusionment, he might just look in the mirror and wave a ten dollar bill at his own reflection.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot's allure evaporated, not only because people got the message, but because the messenger's act wore thin. And the act was all there was -- no action, just a stream of tetchy twang.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ross Perot became the political equivalent of the person who says he could write your column without breaking a sweat. Problem is, he's never sat down at the typewriter. Mr. Perot doesn't have to deal with Congress or run the government -- he only runs his mouth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm in sympathy with those members of Congress who haven't yet decided how to vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It's fraught with ambiguity: could cost jobs in the short run, boost exports in the long run. But Americans hate ambiguity. That's why so many of them liked Mr. Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President thought he was killing two birds with one stone with this debate -- win friends for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and reveal Mr. Perot as a crank. Mr. Perot, accustomed to appearing on \"Larry King Live\" as the centerpiece, was relegated to a place setting, and indeed it made him cranky.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He tried to replay portions of the Presidential race he popped in and out of like a flea with two dogs. (See -- we could probably even teach Al Gore to do this sort of thing.) He had his customary share of hyperbole: is this really \"the biggest lobbying effort in the history of our country\"? He also misjudged his audience, talking about the oppressed working people of Mexico; if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> fails, it will be because Americans think it will hurt the oppressed working people of the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Usually columnists complain when a debate is lively that it's not substantive enough, or when it's substantive it's dull. This debate was neither. If, as the Vice President said, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is right up there with the Louisiana Purchase, people deserved to hear more about both sides than they got on TV.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the evening accomplished one thing: it insures that, from now on, no one need afford Mr. Perot a platform from which to air what pass as his opinions. He's been called a demagogue, a populist and a gadfly. What he is, is over.</p>\n"}
{"id": "421147491.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD; Three Years Later, NAFTA Proves the Naysayers Wrong</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Revelations and charges of drug corruption in Mexico's highest political circles are certain to energize and embolden opponents of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. As such, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will again become a proxy for unease, whether it be engendered by the illicit-drug <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, technological advances, the growth of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment or the competitive power of traditional and emerging economies. But dumping on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will not alter these realities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was under consideration for approval by the U.S. Congress in 1993, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> stimulated more controversy than any other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement of the past 50 years. The concerns focused on two themes: one, that U.S. companies would desert the United States in droves to exploit low-wage Mexican labor, and that the consequent imports would lead to job losses in the hundreds of thousands here; and two, this inrush of imports would result in a large U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, although the significance of this outcome was never made clear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From the outset, the jobs issue as raised was implausible. Merchandise <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, either exports or imports, with Mexico is around 0.8% of U.S. gross domestic product and annual increases in such <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are less than 0.1% of GDP. Job creation does not depend on this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>; rather, it depends on growth within the U.S. economy. This has been evident during the years <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect, when about 2.5 million jobs were created each year. By contrast, the number of job losses that can be traced directly to increased imports from Mexico and Canada during these three years is about 100,000, or about as many jobs as were added to the U.S. economy every two weeks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone who has watched how the bond and stock markets plummet when job creation exceeds estimates, or who has observed the fixation of the Federal Reserve on the inflationary risks of brisk job creation, knows that monetary policy is most concerned with the economy producing too many jobs, not too few.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Runaway investment also must be kept in perspective. Direct investment in U.S. plant and equipment now averages more than $1 trillion a year, compared with $3 billion of U.S. direct investment in Mexico in the high-water year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is an obsession among politicians, reflected in the media, with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with specific countries. In true mercantilistic fashion, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus (more U.S. exports) is \"good,\" while a deficit (an excess of imports over exports) is \"bad.\" In these terms, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was \"good\" in 1994, when the United States had a modest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico, and \"bad\" in 1995 and 1996, when this turned into large U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States is a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r and must expect to have surpluses with some countries and deficits with others. As evident from recent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico, the bilateral balance can shift from year to year, depending on the relative strengths of the two economies. Mexico was in depression in 1995, while the U.S. economy was growing. Consequently, the United States sucked in imports and Mexico could not afford as many imports as it could in 1994. The balance will change again. Beyond that, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus that is cited usually covers only merchandise and not services, which are about 20% the size of U.S. merchandise exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Concern over the temporary bilateral merchandise <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with Mexico is as phony a marker as a $3 bill. It omits a large portion of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the total picture of global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the circumstances for the shifting figures. The idea that a \"positive\" balance is favorable and a \"negative\" one disastrous should have gone out of fashion more than 200 years ago, when Adam Smith tore apart the mercantilist argument. It is a frailty of the political intellect that this relic remains part of the national debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> do not deserve all the blame for focusing on the wrong issues. The Clinton administration made the same two arguments in reverse. They argued that U.S. bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses would grow as Mexico hit its development stride and pulled in imports, and then devised a spurious equation that every extra $1 billion of exports created 20,000 new U.S. jobs. Merchandise exports to Mexico rose by $9 billion in 1994 and this was touted as creating 180,000 jobs. When U.S. exports to Mexico fell by $4 billion in 1995, the response of the opponents of the agreement was that this cost 80,000 jobs, plus an additional 240,000 job losses from the $12 billion rise in U.S. imports from Mexico. Never mind that the United States created jobs at a record pace that year and has continued to do so ever since.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, however, has not brought only sweetness and light. The Mexican economy did collapse in 1995. Although this resulted from internal assassination horrors and macroeconomic policies unrelated to the provisions of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the Mexican population is less well off today than it was before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It is evident that the agreement cannot compensate for misguided domestic policies in Mexico or any of the three member countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For those who lost jobs due to increased imports from Mexico or investment there to take advantage of lower wages, job creation elsewhere in the U.S. economy may not alleviate the pain. In theory, if the U.S. economy, as a whole, gains from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, then the losers can be compensated with some of the increased income. In reality, however, there is little or no compensation. Specialization and economies of scale are \"good\" words for economists. They can spell the death knell, however, to those adjusted out of jobs. The United States has no effective system to deal with the hardships that accompany economic restructuring.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Globalization of the U.S. economy--the increase in direct investment by U.S. corporations and the growing importance of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>--antedates <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and will continue whether or not the agreement endures. The jeans company Guess? is moving some production from Los Angeles to Mexico, but can just as readily go to other locations. The U.S. tariff reductions under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are but a few percentage points, from an average U.S. import duty of about 4% to zero over a 10-year stretch. It is not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone that is at issue, but rather how the United States responds to the changes taking place in domestic production and throughout the world economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was designed to transform three countries separated by sovereign divisions into a single, large market. And it largely has. Total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in North America has increased. Covering just Mexico and the United States, this amounted to $81.5 billion in 1993, the year before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, to $107 billion in 1995.

{"id": "1783212944.xml", "text": "<h2>Five Big Truths About Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is, once again, a hot-button political issue, making this an unpropitious time for rational discourse about the subject. Nonetheless, here are five issues on which the overwhelming majority of economists, liberal and conservative, agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>1. Most job losses are not due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Every month roughly five million new jobs are created in the U.S. and almost that many are destroyed, leaving a small net increment. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accounts for only a minor share of that staggering job churn. Vastly more derives from the hurly-burly of competition and from technological change, which literally creates and destroys entire industries. Competition and technology are widely and correctly applauded -- international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not so fortunate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>2. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is more about efficiency -- and hence wages -- than about the number of jobs. You probably don't sew your own clothes or grow your own food. Instead, you buy these things from others, using the wages you earn doing something you do better. Imagine how much lower your standard of living would be if you had to sew your own clothes, grow your own food . . . and a thousand other things.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The case for international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is no different. It's not mainly about creating or destroying jobs. It's about using labor more efficiently, which is one key to higher wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is a catch: Whenever <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns change, some people will gain (either jobs or wages) but others will lose. The federal government could and should help them more, but it doesn't. So Americans who do lose their jobs due to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have a legitimate gripe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>3. Bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalances are inevitable and mostly uninteresting. Each month I run a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Public Service Electric & Gas. They sell me gas and electricity; I sell them nothing. But I run a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Princeton University, to which I sell teaching services but from which I buy little. Should I seek balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with PSE&G or Princeton? Of course not. Neither should countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>4. Running an overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit does not make us \"losers.\" The U.S. multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance -- its balance with all of its trading partners -- has been in deficit for decades. Does that mean that our country is in some sort of trouble? Probably not. For example, people who claim that our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit kills jobs need to explain how the U.S. managed to achieve 4% unemployment in 2000, when our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was larger, as a share of GDP, than it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit means that foreigners send us more goods and services than we send them. To balance the books, they get our IOUs, which means they wind up holding paper -- U.S. Treasury bills, corporate bonds or other private debt instruments. That doesn't sound so terrible for us, does it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One exceptional country -- the U.S. -- is the source of the world's major international reserve currency, the U.S. dollar. Since ever-expanding world commerce requires ever more dollars, the U.S. must run <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits regularly. That's sometimes called our \"exorbitant privilege,\" since we get to import more than we export.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>5. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements barely affect a nation's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. Much of the political angst is directed not at <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in general, but at specific international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement allegedly shipped U.S. jobs to Mexico; the Trans-Pacific Partnership will allegedly ship U.S. jobs abroad as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a grain of truth here. Some U.S. jobs were indeed destroyed when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> liberalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico -- and those people deserved better treatment from the government than they got. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also created a number of new jobs in the U.S. (See No. 2.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there's more. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>\" and \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements\" are not synonyms. We <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d with Mexico long before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was growing. Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China has burgeoned in recent decades without a succession of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most fundamentally, but least understood, a nation's overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance is determined by its domestic decisions, not by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Think about the accounting involved here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As noted above, borrowing from abroad is the bookkeeping counterpart of running a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. One implies the other. The amount we borrow from abroad must equal the gap between our total spending as a nation (including government spending) and our total income (including the government's income from taxation). Spendthrift nations like the U.S. have <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits because we don't save much. But these saving decisions are domestic; they do not derive from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's chronic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits stem from the dollar's international role and from Americans' decisions not to save much, not from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits are not a major cause of either job losses or job gains. But some people do lose their jobs from shifting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> patterns; and the government should do more to help them. Importantly, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes American workers more productive and, presumably, better paid.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, would someone please tell this to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Look at the Darker Side of Free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Policy\" -- WSJ May. 3, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Alan S.

{"id": "2114799765.xml", "text": "<h2>Worse Than Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North American business leaders are breathing a sigh of relief after Canada agreed, at the 11th hour, to join the revised North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement between the United States and Mexico. But before they break out the Champagne, they should look at the details.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the revised deal brings much-needed modernization in areas such as e-commerce and intellectual property, the media spotlight on Canada has obscured a bigger problem for the region: Under the new terms, North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is headed off the rails and, perhaps along with it, political stability south of the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A key goal of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, like all free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, is bringing certainty to the rules of the game to facilitate commercial exchanges. The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, undermines that certainty in two ways.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the deal eliminates expert panels for resolving government-investor disputes in most industries, save for those covering energy and telecommunications. Although it preserves panels for bilateral disputes regarding dumping and countervailing duties, it defers to domestic courts as the main mechanism for solving controversies should governments change the rules down the road. This measure puts a lot of faith in the transparency and competence of the legal systems of the member countries and opens the door to potential cronyism, unequal access to those systems and even corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, the agreement sets up a mechanism for automatically reviewing its terms on a periodic basis. This and the automatic expiration after 16 years as the default option introduce significant uncertainty by making it less costly for governments to upend existing rules and threaten to exit the agreement. Establishing periodic reviews as natural breaking points for the rules of the game would certainly shorten investors\u2019 time horizons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given the changes championed by the Trump administration, investors will be especially wary of governments\u2019 seeking to move the goal posts in the future. This would affect employment opportunities and job security across North America. Slowdowns in economic activity in both Canada and Mexico, as well as sharp declines in foreign direct investment, can already be traced to the uncertainty surrounding current negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both of these changes point to a bigger problem with the new deal: the deinstitutionalization of North American economic ties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The certainty and centrality of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to United States-Mexican relations has proved integral to aligning the two countries\u2019 economic and strategic interests. Before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, relations were far from harmonious, in part because Mexico\u2019s interests were solidly on the side of the global south. Pointing to a history of invasions, occupations and the loss of half of its territory to the United States, Mexico long saw its northern neighbor as a threat to be contained.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This explains why Mexico refused to support Washington-led initiatives at the Organization of American States to condemn Communism in Guatemala in the 1950s, rejected the expulsion of Cuba from the O.A.S. in the 1960s and acted with complacency toward the threat of leftist takeovers in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico developed a stake in the economic success of the United States, which went from threat to partner. It has been directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s dependence on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the United States for its own economic development. With its economic fortunes intertwined with those of its northern neighbor, Mexico veered away from the Latin American political orbit and turned decidedly toward North America. In 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> served as an important carrot for Mexico to gain membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly developed nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also imposed constraints on the Mexican government\u2019s latitude to depart from the alignment with United States interests. In Mexico\u2019s legal system, international agreements are second only to the articles in the Mexican Constitution \u2014 above federal, state and local laws. Even if the government tried to depart from the pro-market orientation and respect for property rights provided for in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it would be subject to a number of legal challenges.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dependability of this partnership is undermined every time the agreement is up for renegotiation, whether scheduled or not. That\u2019s what we mean by deinstitutionalization: If it is subject to political whims in the three countries, then it is no longer a settled agreement, and its place as a foundation of cooperative United States-Mexican relations will quickly erode.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration\u2019s rush to sign the agreement before Mexico\u2019s pro-business president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, leaves office on Nov. 30 suggests that the White House considers the more nationalist, leftist successor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador a riskier proposition. If President Trump is concerned about future Mexican governments\u2019 seeing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>  in a different light, this problem will be greatly magnified under the new terms the White House has pushed for.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. President Trump must now send the deal to Congress for approval. It is up to Capitol Hill, then, to make sure that whatever deal emerges, it continues to provide a reliable, permanent basis for North America\u2019s <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and political relationships. Although the up-or-down nature of the vote makes any changes unlikely, this experience should serve as a valuable lesson as America redesigns its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with the rest of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Gustavo A.

{"id": "293283208.xml", "text": "<h2>MEXICO; Why Immigration Is Now a Human Rights Cause</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican reaction to the beating of two illegal immigrants by Riverside County sheriff's deputies and the deaths of seven Mexican nationals in a fatal accident during a pursuit by the Border Patrol has been fierce. The two incidents have dominated the media, easily outdistancing even the dire economic situation that has been the staple of news coverage during the last year. It has not been a good week for U.S.-Mexico relations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without exception among the main political parties and the mainstream media, the Mexican reaction illustrates to what extent the latent anti-Mexican sentiment believed to exist in the United States has been given respectability by Gov. Pete Wilson and presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan. All the political parties represented in the two houses of the Mexican Congress--three parties have seats in the Senate, four in the Chamber of Deputies--have joined in calling for an \"exhaustive\" investigation of what is referred to as an aggressive violation of human rights in the United States. It is near impossible to think of another current issue on which the parties have come together; indeed, the normal situation is for them to be at each other's throats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's foreign secretary even had to defend himself from political criticism for making too \"tepid\" a response to the incidents. This, despite condemnatory statements from the foreign ministry, the Mexican ambassador in Washington, D.C., and the Mexican consul general in Los Angeles. In a poll taken April 8-9 by the sister newspapers Reforma, in Mexico City, and El Norte, in Monterrey, 61% of the respondents said they were still not satisfied with the response of the Mexican government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason for the intensity of the Mexican public's resentment is that the dramatic video of the immigrant beatings in Riverside County has been repeatedly shown on Mexican television. The fact that one victim was a women is never left unsaid. Mexicans, when pressed, will concede that their compatriots involved in the incidents were illegally in the United States, but the very word \"illegal\" does not carry the resonance here that it does in, say, California. Mexican commentators repeatedly insist that these people are not criminals. They are poverty-stricken people looking for work to care for their families and would not be in the United States if there were no demand for them there. Americans tend to assume that the illegal-immigrant phenomenon is supply-driven, while Mexican analysts contend it is demand-driven. It is obviously a combination of the two factors working together, but in the U.S. conception, the clandestine crossing of the border is the problem, while in the Mexican, it is the solution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is a long-standing analytical difference between the two countries, but previous reactions to cases of maltreatment of Mexican migrants have rarely been this ferocious. One explanation is that Mexico's economic situation encourages a search for distractions. The economy was in free fall in 1995: gross domestic product feel by 6.9%; unemployment rose by some 2 million, and real take-home pay dropped by about 13%. There is still no letup to this grinding hardship. Entry into the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement had promised better times but, instead, things are worse. In such circumstances, cause (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) and effect (economic hard times) need not be precisely demonstrated. Most Mexicans are worse off today and there is much sentiment that this is because Mexico unwisely got into bed with the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Attacks on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and on Mexico by prominent U.S. political figures have added to the disillusionment. Efforts undertaken by Sen. Alphonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to have Mexico decertified for insufficiently cooperating with the United States in dealing with narcotics trafficking are resented here as domestic U.S. posturing at Mexico's expense. Even though Buchanan stands no chance of becoming president, the Clinton administration has reacted, in part, to his immigration rhetoric by beefing up the numbers and equipment of the Border Patrol. New fences are going up. Legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to deny education to undocumented children. All these development are fully reported and cause consternation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Mexican intellectuals, such as those who write opinion columns and who hold senior academic positions, have never been comfortable with the close economic cooperation with the United States that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires. Their suspicions are fortified when the United States simultaneously closes the border to people but insists that it should be kept open to goods, services and investment. The intellectuals' closet hostility was muted during <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations, but continued soft-pedaling of their gut views is now seen as less necessary in light of anti-Mexican xenophobia in important U.S. circles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Jones, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, responded to the beatings and fatal accident, and the Mexican reaction to them, by stating that the relationship between the two countries is intact. This is probably correct at senior levels of the two administrations, but is more problematic in the nations' two legislatures and for many men and women in the streets of the two countries. The current flurry of attention on the human-rights aspects of illegal immigration will pass, but the underlying problem that has come to the surface will be more durable.*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sidney Weintraub holds the William E.

{"id": "2034904330.xml", "text": "<h2>Mr. Trump may have no Plan B on trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A TWO-DAY meeting between Trump administration <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> officials and Chinese representatives concluded in Beijing on Friday with an agreement to meet again later, and little else. This was no surprise, considering that the president's team brought demands to China that ranged from defensible - ending subsidies for high-tech industries, better access to investment opportunities for U.S. companies - to arbitrary: a $200 billion reduction in the bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit by the end of 2020. China had its own demands, including an end to the U.S. threat of tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This exchange was certainly preferable to a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war, but it also illustrated a basic problem with Mr. Trump's approach. Even if you grant there may be some strategic value to threats as a negotiating tool, no one - not American trading partners, not American business and workers - can tell whether the president actually would accept a compromise, or what its content might be. Similar uncertainty prevails in the U.S. relationship with Europe, freshly granted a 30-day respite from Mr. Trump's proposed tariff on steel and aluminum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the same goes for Canada and Mexico. Last month, in fact, the president all but confessed that he sees uncertainty as a weapon against them in talks over revising the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. \"We can negotiate forever,\" he said. \"Because as long as we have this negotiation going, nobody is going to build billion-dollar plants in Mexico.\" Oh no? Canada and Mexico can, and do, hedge against Mr. Trump's unpredictability by pursuing closer economic ties with China and Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agenda reflects the president's fixation on bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, especially in automobiles. The U.S.'s neighbors have been willing to at least consider how to keep more automotive production in North America, including the administration's counterproductive proposal for a minimum-wage rule on cars and car parts that qualify for tariff-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> area. Yet U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative Robert E. Lighthizer also appears to be insisting on a five-year sunset clause for the whole treaty. This would be a recipe for more uncertainty and potentially a dealbreaker for the other two countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Mr. Lighthizer has picked a fight with the U.S. business community over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s dispute resolution system, which business sees as a key protection for their investments in Mexico and Canada - and he considers a de facto subsidy for corporate capital flight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks resume Monday, and despite upbeat reports from all three countries' negotiators in recent weeks, there is danger now in the calendar. Even if there's an agreement, it may come too late for lawmakers to ratify it. U.S. law requires that any preliminary agreement be subjected to a vetting process over a prescribed minimum period before Congress can even vote. And that period would almost certainly not be over before the November midterm election. Mr. Lighthizer seems to believe he can win at brinkmanship with both the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partner countries and Congress. If he cannot, then Mr. Trump may have no Plan B, other than the potentially disastrous one of announcing a U.S. pullout from an agreement on which an entire continent's businesses have relied for a quarter century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "398782446.xml", "text": "<h2>Politics &amp; people: Fast or fatal track for Democrats?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Irishman, as William Butler Yeats wrote, has \"an abiding sense of tragedy which sustains him through temporary periods of joy.\" If political parties were nationalities, the Democrats would be Irish.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Democrats, joyful over the schisms plaguing Republicans, there is a looming calamity: the fast-track initiative President Clinton will propose in September to give him authority to negotiate free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are two realities here: One, fast-track is essential if the U.S. is to continue to play a leading role in the global economy; but two, it will seriously exacerbate fault lines within the Democratic Party. It is a foregone conclusion that a decisive majority of congressional Democrats will vote against the president; the ensuing tensions will make it considerably harder for them to win back control of Congress in 1998.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fast-track legislation would simply give the president the authority to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, whether bilateral deals with Chile and South Africa or sectoral pacts in areas like agriculture and financial services. These treaties then would be brought back to Congress for up-or-down approval but couldn't be amended or changed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without fast-track, any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact would become a special-interest bazaar in the legislative branch. When Congress started to reject portions of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements a quarter-century ago, this procedure was necessitated. Such authority expired several years ago, and without it, any major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals are impossible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As right as it is on the merits, the politics of fast-track are dicey. The opposition will include labor, many environmentalists, the Pat Buchanan-led economic nationalists and Ross Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the strong economy, the public is skeptical of unfettered free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In this week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, respondents by a stunning 2-to-1 margin opposed giving the president fast-track authority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of this is a residual effect of the 1993 North America Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Charlene Barshefsky, in laying the groundwork for fast-track legislation, has talked to more than 175 members of Congress, and practically every one offers a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> horror story of some plant that moved or jobs that were lost. Actually, much of this is exaggerated; <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't yet produced some of the benefits proponents promised, but neither has it caused the ills critics claim.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the White House will try strenuously to divorce fast-track from these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> perceptions. \"We won't fight this on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> battleground,\" says Victoria Radd, a top White House aide who has been detailed to the fast-track fight. \"We will fight it on the future battleground.\" Similarly, Ambassador Barshefsky says: \"To say that fast track is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ignores the necessity for U.S. leadership in the global economy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But no matter how the argument is framed, it splits the Democratic party. It's a little bit of the New Democrat vs. Old Democrat schism. But more than that, it reflects different constituencies -- the more traditional and usually industrial districts vs. higher-tech, cutting-edge sectors of the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These splits will be symbolized today. The president will meet with several dozen House Democrats at the White House to pitch fast track. At about the same time, a few hundred yards away in the AFL-CIO building, the top labor chieftain, John Sweeney, will convene a meeting of leading legislative, political and media officials from major unions to map an anti-fast-track strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also goes to the politics of 2000. Leading the fight against fast track will be House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D., Mo.). Within the administration sits an uncomfortable Vice President Albert Gore, who knows the issue is going to cause him grief with core constituencies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gephardt has tried to persuade the administration to water down any request for fast-track authority, in order to limit the political fallout; even free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Democrats like California's Vic Fazio have voiced concern to both Mr. Gephardt and the White House over the likely political damage. But Clinton operatives are contemptuous of Mr. Gephardt's motives, charging he only advances thinly disguised protectionist pitches that the president finds unacceptable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration plans an all-out push. It has hired an outside lobbyist to direct the campaign; the top cabinet officials will be actively engaged this fall; and it has enlisted two highly resourceful former members of congress, Republican Vin Weber and Democrat Tom Downey, a close confidant of Mr. Gore.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The battle will be waged first in the House, where Republicans publicly insist the White House must deliver 90 Democrats -- privately, that number is more like 70 -- out of the 206 total House Democrats. But according to a reliable Democratic strategist, there are currently fewer than 60 Democratic votes for fast-track. At a White House meeting last week, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means committee, pointedly warned the president he has to do more for workers displaced by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other concessions may prove very elusive. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreement on labor and environment has proven toothless. Leading congressional Republicans now insist on going the other way, telling the White House there must be language that makes it clear that any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations involving labor and environmental matters will be very limited.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the president tries to cater to Dick Gephardt and John Sweeney, he's not going to get fast-track,\" bluntly warns Rep. David Dreier (R., Calif.), a key GOP <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> strategist.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the president will probably succeed. Despite public opinion and formidable opposition, presidents almost invariably win major foreign policy and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives. Moreover, for all the rhetoric of labor, the pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> business community has more resources. And there would be consequences if fast-track fails. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> negotiations would continue without the U.S.; only recently Canada cut a deal with Chile.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, as the president showed in the recently completed budget deal, when he needlessly caved in on some tax provisions in order to get a quick deal -- to clear the decks for fast-track this fall -- he often prefers dealing with Republicans. Thus, the likely final resolution -- another second-term victory for the White House that virtually assures continued GOP control of the House in 1998 -- is a bargain to which Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans are growing accustomed.</p>\n"}

{"id": "1988289463.xml", "text": "<h2>Killing Nafta Would Ruin American Farmers; And given how many live in red states, it would doom the GOP in the 2018 elections.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a Wall Street Journal interview last week, President Trump said if he were to \"terminate\" the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, it \"would be frankly a positive for our country.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This bluster could be a negotiating ploy before the next trilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks, set for Jan. 28 in Montreal. If not, Mr. Trump should stop threatening. Withdrawing from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would immediately kill American jobs, while handing Democrats the midterm elections on a silver platter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980 President Carter demolished farm counties with his embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union. This was bad politics and bad policy, but at least he was trying to punish an adversary. If Mr. Trump kills <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, he'd be damaging red states to undermine allies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is especially important to American farmers and ranchers. U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada were $8.9 billion in 1993, before the agreement kicked in. Today, they are $39 billion, accounting for 30% of America's farm exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These exports are critical in many states with key elections this year. In North Dakota, which Mr. Trump won by 36 points, Republicans want to flip the Senate seat held by Democrat Heidi Heitkamp. But the state's commerce commissioner, Jay Schuler, says North Dakota exports 84% of its crops--worth $3.5 billion--to Mexico and Canada. Withdrawing from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would subject those products to high foreign tariffs in force before the deal took effect, leaving farm families very unhappy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans also hope to flip Senate seats in Missouri and Indiana, both of which Mr. Trump carried by 19 points. The GOP is fighting to keep governorships in Iowa and Kansas, which the president won by 9 points and 21 points, respectively.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These campaigns will be much more difficult if farm economies are ruined by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> termination. Missouri is a major producer of corn, soybeans, beef and turkey; Indiana of corn and soybeans; Iowa of corn, soybeans and pork; and Kansas of wheat, corn and beef. Much of this is exported to Mexico. If the U.S. pulled out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexican tariffs would snap back to 75% on American chickens, high-fructose corn syrup and potatoes, 45% on turkey, and 25% on beef.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As former North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, himself a farmer, points out, it takes a long time to develop foreign customer relationships. Once disrupted, those agricultural markets wouldn't come back quickly. People in farming would know who to blame.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there are the car-making states. In the almost quarter-century since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect, the U.S. auto industry has built a hemispheric supply chain to help it compete with European and Asian auto makers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee each have important Senate races, and all but Indiana have governor's contests, too. In each of those states, at least 9% of the workforce is tied to autos, and in Michigan the figure is 20%. Their exports of cars and auto parts range from $5.9 billion in Tennessee to $26 billion in Michigan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump made good on his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> threat, he would disrupt the auto industry's supply chain, making American-made cars more expensive at home and less competitive abroad. Does he really want to blow up these states' economies--along with those of roughly a dozen other states with auto production (including Missouri, Pennsylvania and West Virginia)?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I haven't even gotten to the crucial elections in border states like Texas and Arizona, which are important way stations for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and whose economies would face major difficulties if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> disappears.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In discussing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mr. Trump keeps getting his numbers wrong. Last week he declared that the U.S. has a $71 billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and \"we lose $17 billion with Canada.\" Actually, after counting sales of goods and services, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico in 2016 was just $55.6 billion. With Canada, the U.S. ran a $12.5 billion surplus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does Mr. Trump ignore the U.S. advantage in services--everything from insurance to banking to logistics--because it undermines his anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> case? Or, despite coming from the service industry himself, does he think service jobs are less worthy than manufacturing ones? Try defending that proposition to employees at Travelers (a big insurance player in Canada) or FedEx and UPS (which provide logistics and shipping there) or Wal-Mart (Mexico's largest retailer) or MetLife (which insures 78% of Mexican government employees) or Citibank (which owns Mexico's second-biggest bank).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that is two decades old needs updating. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is no exception, especially given the growth of e-commerce and the digital economy. But bad policy is bad politics. Killing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would damage Republicans in agricultural, auto and border states and help elect more Democrats in 2018, strengthening the party's impeachment efforts.

{"id": "2094040597.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump and Mexico: The art of puffing the deal</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump announced Monday that he's \"terminating\" the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, and boasted that he and Mexico just struck \"maybe the largest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Actually: Trump can't unilaterally kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; this is only a possible step toward any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal involving Mexico; it's probably not a good step; and it may not actually lead to any new deal at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, it's precisely the puffery we've come to expect from a president who doesn't understand what his own administration is doing, or doesn't care.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump campaigned on fixing our \"stupid\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. And, at more than two decades old, this tripartite pact with Canada and Mexico does indeed require sprucing up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The global economy has changed since the early 1990s. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't address major industries that barely existed (if they existed at all) when the agreement was negotiated, such as e-commerce. It also didn't do much for labor or environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, politicians have been vowing to update <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in 2008, Barack Obama also campaigned on a promise to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He ultimately did, in the form of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The 12-country <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact included Canada and Mexico among its signatories, and contained extensive language modernizing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules (including a whole chapter on</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>e-commerce) and raising labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alas, one of Trump's first acts in office was to pull out of TPP. Worse, he subsequently lobbed new tariffs in virtually every direction, including at our allies in North America. The</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>fallout from Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war-mongering has unquestionably hurt Canada and Mexico, as well as U.S. firms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday, Trump proclaimed this front in his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars was over. We allegedly have a new deal with Mexico, he said - a bilateral agreement that will replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and leave Canada cowering in fear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A lot of people thought we'd never get here,\" he declared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in truth, \"here\" is pretty close to where we were before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is still no signed Mexico deal. And, unfortunately for Trump, he does not actually have authority from Congress to split <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into two separate bilateral deals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Additionally, most of what's in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is implemented by statute. That means that no matter what Trump says, most of its provisions will live on unless and until Congress actually, you know, passes a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law. Which a Republican-led Congress doesn't seem keen to do, at least if the new law in question is more protectionist than the one we have.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress also isn't the only barrier to ditching <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in favor of separate bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Canada and Mexico have each said that any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that results should include the involvement of all three countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, during Trump's Monday Oval Office event, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said no fewer than four timesthat he still expected Canada to be part of any final agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He even closed his call by saying: \"We'll be waiting for Canada to be integrated into this process.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So did the recent round of discussions between Mexico and the United States produce any results?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sort of. But it's hard to call it progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States and Mexico seem to have resolved some of their differences, including on automotive \"rules of origin.\" These complicated new rules would add burdensome requirements for any cars that could be imported into the United States from Mexico without tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Based on what we know so far, these requirements would likely require an enormous expansion of the administrative state (not something Republicans usually support), raise the cost of cars to consumers, and possibly reduce the number of cars assembled in North America - which is, of course, the opposite of their intended effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing announced thus far suggests</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the stuff we got Mexico to agree to would help the United States increase car exports to Mexico at all. \"For autos, I am worried that the main outcome is a changing of the rules to allow us to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> less with Mexico,\" Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow Chad P. Bown tells me.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's if the deal actually goes through.

{"id": "422016802.xml", "text": "<h2>THE NATION; Ronald Brownstein / WASHINGTON OUTLOOK; America's Economic Nationalists Find New Anxieties to Feed On</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a sign of the times that the House Republican leadership believes the only way to win approval of a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Central America this week is to first pass legislation bashing China for its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That legislative minuet is a clear indication the economic nationalists are back.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic nationalists were the politicians and policy analysts who raised the loudest alarms about the commercial challenge posed by Japan in the 1980s and early 1990s. They wrote books such as \"Japan as Number One,\" warned of the \"deindustrialization of America\" and touted industrial policies to promote more cooperation between business and government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) was an economic nationalist. So was Ross Perot. Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official under President Reagan, was a leading thinker among them. Labor union presidents, executives at manufacturing companies threatened by low-wage foreign competition and members of Congress sympathetic to either filled in their ranks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For roughly the last dozen years, the economic nationalists have been exiled to the edge of American politics (more on that below). But like the cicada, they have returned, this time in the debate about the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and the noisy dispute over the bid from China's CNOOC Ltd. to purchase Unocal Corp.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 1980s, the economic nationalists fed on anxiety that Japan was eclipsing the U.S. as the world's dominant economy. Today, they are drawing energy from concern about the loss of jobs to rising economic powers like China and India, as well as to low-wage competitors like the six small nations included in the proposed CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The common thread is that the economic nationalists, then and now, insist the U.S. needs a more confrontational <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, and a more activist government economic strategy, to promote and protect high-paying American jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A lot of these issues were raised in the 1980s, then we got really lucky when Japan hit a bump in the 1990s,\" said Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute and author of \"Three Billion New Capitalists,\" a compelling new book on the challenge from Asia. \"But we haven't really addressed most of the issues that Japan posed in the 1980s, and a lot of those things are coming back.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic nationalists don't uniformly oppose future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals; Prestowitz, for instance, supports CAFTA. Yet almost everyone in this camp shares a fear that in the international economic competition, America is \"falling dangerously behind,\" as Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, put it as the Senate debated CAFTA last month.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic nationalists also share a common agenda centered on increasing federal funding for scientific research and education, reducing the federal deficit and dependence on foreign oil, cutting healthcare costs for U.S. employers, reforming education and pressuring China, which agreed to modestly revalue its currency last week, to let the yuan appreciate further.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The convergence of the disputes over CAFTA and CNOOC have provided the economic nationalists with their biggest megaphone in years to press these arguments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fears about American decline dissipated in the 1990s as Japan's economy stumbled and America's took off, especially in the Internet boom. Although President Clinton's administration pushed to open the Japanese market, his overall free market orientation -- symbolized by his support for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- reduced the influence of the economic nationalists dubious of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As America's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit steadily rose through Clinton's second term and President Bush's first, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> skeptics in both parties continued a drumbeat of concern. But they mostly retreated, as Congress approved free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with countries such as Jordan and Australia, and granted China permanent low-tariff access to the U.S. market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the economic nationalists faced an even larger problem: Their arguments about America's economic security were almost entirely drowned out by the focus on the nation's military security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in the 2004 presidential race, the wind shifted. While Bush staunchly defended free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, all of the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination expressed far more skepticism toward open markets than Clinton had.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same drift has continued this year. CAFTA squeezed through the Senate, 54 to 45. That's seven fewer votes than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> won 12 years ago. In 1993, half of Senate Democrats voted for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Less than one-fourth of Senate Democrats supported CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Senate, Rob Portman, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, skillfully negotiated for votes from Republicans worried about protecting U.S. sugar growers and Democrats concerned about labor rights in Central America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the agreement faces a close vote in the House less because of its practical impact than because it has become a symbol of economic globalization.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's where the pending vote targeting China's trading practices fits in. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advocates widely agree that China's rise has deepened anxiety about competing with any low-wage economy, which hurts CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"China just has a shadow on all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> things,\" says Bill Miller, the top lobbyist and political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The calculation is that if House Republicans can please anti- <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> interests by first casting a vote to whack China, more GOP lawmakers would risk disappointing those interests by supporting CAFTA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As legislative strategy, it's a brilliant idea. And it might work for CAFTA. But it doesn't change the underlying dynamic. Amid a new wave of global competition, concern about America's ability to generate good jobs is cresting again -- and returning economic nationalism from the periphery of the Washington debate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Ronald Brownstein's column appears every Monday.

{"id": "1862281826.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's Forceful Resistance</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MEXICO CITY -- It has been just over a week since President Trump took office, and he already has a diplomatic mini-crisis on his hands. First, he demanded that Mexico pay for his wall along our mutual border -- on the very day when Mexican diplomats were to meet with White House officials. When President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico rejected that idea out of hand, Mr. Trump tweeted that he should consider calling off a planned visit to Washington next Tuesday. Which is just what Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did.For Mexico, the cancellation, and the rise in tensions with the United States, are a sad and serious affair.Sad, because no Mexican wants a breakdown in bilateral ties. Five successive presidents have pursued a new course with our northern neighbor, putting behind us the apprehensions and resentment of the past. The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, American support during the mid-'90s financial crisis, immigration negotiations in 2001, expanded drug enforcement and security cooperation, and the encouragement of a new mind-set for Mexicans where being neighbors is no longer seen as a problem but as an opportunity: All of this is being questioned and jeopardized.And serious, because in tying itself to the United States, Mexico has placed all its eggs in one basket: North America, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, democracy and respect for human rights. President Trump's executive orders and his views on these fundamental issues make that decision seem like a mistake.This is why Mexico today faces a tough choice, given the asymmetry between both countries: accommodate Mr. Trump and get the least-bad deal possible, or lay out a series of red lines or list of American demands Mexico cannot accept and adopt a policy of forceful resistance. It could then attempt to wait Mr. Trump out, hoping that he will open too many fronts simultaneously, that domestic opposition to his excesses will grow, and that Mexico's allies in the United States and abroad will eventually rebalance the unequal correlation of forces.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had no choice but to cancel his trip. But he had partly boxed himself into a corner because of previous indecision or procrastination.He knew some time ago that Mr. Trump would insist on renegotiation. He knew that several roads could lead to a favorable outcome for all three member countries, but that there could also be dire consequences for Mexico if the road chosen led to a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requiring drawn-out deliberations in the legislative bodies of Canada, the United States and Mexico. The agreement would then fall hostage to partisan bickering, with no guarantees of approval. The uncertainty that would entail might easily place new foreign investment in Mexico on hold.Mexico should have a red line on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Everything that can be done without new legislative approval in all the three countries is fair game, but nothing else. Better to have the United States invoke <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Article 2205, which says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice.A similar red line should have been drawn by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto on the prickliest, if not the most substantive issue: the wall. Again, incomprehensibly, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto painted himself into a corner by stressing the wall's payment, rather than its very existence. The crux of the matter should never have been who would pay for it, but rather that it was an unfriendly act toward a friendly country, sending a disastrous symbolic message to Latin America. The real issue is that it will generate countless social, cultural and environmental problems along the border; raise the cost and danger of unauthorized crossings; and attract even more organized crime.Mexico should now clearly draw another red line. If the United States wants to build a wall, we will use every tool available to delay it and make it more expensive. But we will also point out that President Trump's wall better be a very effective one. Because it will have to deter, without any further Mexican cooperation, drugs, migrants, terrorists and \"bad hombres\" from entering. If Mr. Trump \"breaks\" the border arrangement that our two countries have enjoyed for nearly a century, he \"owns\" it (the Pottery Barn rule).Finally, on deportations, Mexico must also publicize its nonnegotiable bottom line. More money and agents for immigration enforcement, punishing sanctuary cities and attempting to send so-called criminals to Mexico is likewise an unfriendly act. Especially when one recalls that the same policy toward El Salvador in the late 1990s made it the most violent country in the world.Mexico must say clearly that we will encourage all our potential deportees to demand a hearing upon arrest and to refuse voluntary removal; that we will provide legal support, on our dime, for all arrested undocumented Mexicans; and that we will deny entry to anyone whom American authorities cannot prove is a Mexican citizen. These are not simple decisions and are not exempt from the risk of retaliation. But neither is a 20 percent tariff on imports from Mexico, a proposal the White House suggested on Thursday it might embrace.Mexico's most effective leverage in this unfortunate and needless conflict lies in its stability on the United States's southern flank. Washington should count its blessings. For a century, the United States has been an accomplice to Mexican corruption, human rights violations and authoritarian rule. But it has also supported Mexico economically, abstained from seeking regime change, tolerated mass migration from the south and generally treated Mexico with respect. The quid pro quo was immensely and mutually beneficial. Messing with it is worse than rash: It is reckless, for both countries.JORGE G. CASTANEDA   Jorge G.

I simply wrote a letter supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dean was not in the least abashed that he had described himself on the same show, eight years earlier, as \"a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, we patients rarely dare to have such pugnacious dialogue with our doctors. George Stephanopoulos doesn't have to wear one of those demoralizing gowns with all the confusing snaps, and if you're sick you have more important things to do during your tiny portions of face time than bicker with your doctor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(A disclaimer: Naturally, all the doctors who are presently  treating and advising me are paragons of sagacity and compassion, nothing at all like the men and women I am so broadly lampooning. You know who you are.) The odd thing is that most of Dean's unacknowledged shifts in position are of the kind any other half- good politician, with some vaporous wording, could explain away in his sleep. But even when Dean makes what is clearly a blunder, it takes him days to make the apology that a rival campaign would instinctively produce before the next news cycle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings me to the irrationally strong impulse, shared by doctors and politicians, to hoard information. Consider the high- handed way Dean has tried to shield great portions of his gubernatorial records. Similarly, doctors seem bent on ensuring that you not read the runic scribblings they have made in your chart. During one hospital stay, as I sat in a wheelchair outside Radiology waiting to be pushed back to my room, I began idly flipping through my chart. A young female doctor-in-training I had never seen before stopped in front of me and said, \"You know, you really shouldn't be reading your chart.\" I thanked her for her advice and continued reading. She repeated her admonition. I explained that I was 43 and couldn't possibly read anything worse there than I had already been told by five real doctors. Upon which she actually wrested it from my grasp. (From this I learned always to go to a stall in the ladies' room when I want to read my chart.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, let's turn to what newspapers delicately title \"the temperament question.\" Dean's been called arrogant, angry, condescending, prickly. He has gotten this far by playing his chesty irritability as a sign of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I have enough brusque, irritable doctors in my life without sending one to the White House. My most memorable brushes have been with an eminent surgeon whose method is to stride into the examining room two hours late, pat your hand, pronounce your certain death if he can't perform an operation on you, and then snap at your husband to stop taking notes, he can't possibly follow the complexity of the doctor's thinking. Dr. X swats away questions like flies. He spends five precious minutes swearing at the wall-mounted phone, which decades of surgical experience have not equipped him to operate, and then finally pronounces that he can't perform the surgery. \"Unless you want me to. But there's a 50-50 chance I would kill you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why is it, I ask my husband on the way home, that I'm the one who's sick, but they're the ones who are allowed to have the big, operatic personalities?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have the same concern about Dean. Why should Democrats choose to stand around all spring and summer holding their breath against the moment when Dean says something arrogant or impolitic? (Think Southern guys with Confederate flag decals on their pickup trucks.) We're the ones who are supposed to be allowed to go on with our temperamental little lives, while our major-party nominees are the poor chumps who have agreed to adhere to the rigid, Ken-doll theater of politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so I bring to my assessment of this year's Democratic candidates one requirement that never crossed my mind before. First, do no harm.</p>\n"}
{"id": "399077014.xml", "text": "<h2>Main Street: Obama and the Clinton Legacy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Inside the Fourth Estate, the received wisdom holds that the White House is now home to the anti-Bush. And on issues from taxes and stem cells to union elections and Guantanamo, Barack Obama is indeed taking America in a direction different from that of his predecessor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, there's a persuasive case that the legacy most threatened by the Obama presidency belongs to the last Democrat who sat in the Oval Office: Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think about it. It was Mr. Clinton who campaigned on the promise to \"end welfare as we know it.\" It was Mr. Clinton who signed the bill removing the Glass-Steagall barriers separating commercial from investment banking. Most famously, it was Mr. Clinton who assured us that \"the era of Big Government is over.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today all the assumptions that once defined Bill Clinton's \"New Democrats\" are being contested by the Obama White House. And nowhere is the contrast more stark than on the defining issue of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To begin with, Mr. Obama has yet to deliver a major address on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- especially telling, given the global economic uncertainty. In sharp contrast, barely one month into office, Mr. Clinton heralded America's global leadership on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as one of the most important challenges of our day. To underscore the importance of his message, he chose for his venue American University, where his hero JFK had delivered a famous address on peace in a nuclear age. There Mr. Clinton called for American leadership to open up markets abroad, not just to boost opportunity for Americans but to advance freedom and democracy for all people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, Mr. Obama has yet to even ask Congress for fast-track authority -- legislation that gives a president greater flexibility to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Again, in sharp contrast, at this same point in the Clinton presidency Congress was putting the final touches on fast-track legislation that Mr. Clinton would use to help complete the successful Uruguay Round of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, though Mr. Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Ron Kirk, recently announced that the administration planned to finish up outstanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with key U.S. allies -- Colombia, South Korea and Panama -- he gave little but lip service for a forward agenda. On the White House Web site, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> isn't even listed as an issue. By contrast, not only was Bill Clinton working to conclude the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) at this point in his presidency, he and his senior administration figures were already talking about expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to other Latin America nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One highlight of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> fight was the televised debate between Al Gore and H. Ross Perot. In that debate, the vice president seemed to be channeling Milton Friedman. Indeed, Mr. Gore even managed to introduce a brilliant stage prop -- handing the Texas billionaire a framed photograph of Reed Smoot and Willis Hawley, the two legislators whose protectionist tariff legislation helped usher in the Great Depression.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, the differences between the Clinton and Obama approaches to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> no doubt owe something to differences in economic philosophy. But they probably also owe something to personal experience. Governors spend a great deal of time at events like factory openings because they know firsthand what the jobs created by foreign investment and overseas <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> can mean to a family and community, not to mention what economic growth means for their political tenure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So it was probably no coincidence that at a time when Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt was out excoriating the Japanese and Koreans for their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies, Gov. Clinton, his fellow Democrat, was trying to sell them on coming to Arkansas. As governor, Mr. Clinton would make 12 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> missions overseas. And he would see the number of companies in the state with foreign investment triple.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of these companies was Japan's Bridgestone Corporation. In 1988, Bridgestone acquired the U.S. company Firestone Tire and Rubber. Mr. Clinton invoked that example in a profile published in the Atlantic just a month before he was elected president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Bridgestone had plenty of money,\" he told the reporter. \"They came in here, spent thirty million dollars modernizing these plants, retrained the workers, gave them the benefit of modern management, and expanded the work force. It's a good thing.\" While Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the purchase of Firestone by a Japanese company would probably mean that some R&D work moved overseas, he nonetheless said the purchase of Firestone was a \"blessing\" for his state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A senator generally doesn't see <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> from this angle. A senator doesn't get the personal feel for opportunity that a governor does when he returns from a successful <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> mission. This comes through in Mr. Obama's books, where the passion he brings to other issues is absent on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and any talk about its benefits is limited to the kind of dry acknowledgment you might expect from a very intelligent law professor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which may be Mr. Obama's way of saying: So much for \"New Democrats\" and the Clinton legacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By William McGurn</p>\n"}
{"id": "430893454.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's Vulnerable Workers</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Congress debated the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, President Clinton won over some critics by including a side agreement that guarantees labor rights in Mexico, including the right of workers to choose their own unions. But the struggle for a free union at a Tijuana, Mexico, plant that makes truck chassis for Hyundai Precision America in San Diego shows that the agreement is little more than cosmetic. Three workers dismissed from the plant for organizing a union election are now in their 16th day of a hunger strike, hoping to persuade Mexico's Government to recognize the independent union the workers selected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although Mexicans theoretically enjoy the right to organize, their labor unions have long been organs of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Mexico's dominant political organization. The party uses the unions to turn out workers on Election Day and to keep labor cheap and peaceful. The PRI-affiliated union at the Han Young factory functioned as in most of the 2,700 factories, known as maquiladoras, near the American border. The union negotiated the workers' contract in secret and its representative told workers they were lucky to be making 85 cents an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Han Young's workers went on strike in June for better wages and conditions and the right to choose their own representatives. The PRI union and the governor of Baja California tried to prevent a union election. The governor, a member of the rightist PAN party, said he would not allow ''foreign political interests'' to discourage investment. But by a 55-to-32 margin the workers elected an independent union, for the first time in a maquiladora.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican Government's labor board, however, has ruled it will not certify the results, and more organizers have been dismissed. Workers are appealing the decision. Although Hyundai says it has no control over Han Young, this is a divorce of convenience for Hyundai. Since Han Young exists only to produce for Hyundai, Hyundai is responsible for Han Young's practices. Mexican law agrees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems likely the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> labor office will find that the Han Young case violates the labor agreement. But that will be of little help to Mexican workers. Such violations carry no penalty, only the possibility of consultations between the Mexican and American labor secretaries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is too late to rewrite <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but not too late to pressure Mexico to enforce its own laws. President Clinton raised the Han Young issue with President Ernesto Zedillo. Mr. Clinton surely knows that the cause of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not helped when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s labor guarantees are squashed so blatantly.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2099304391.xml", "text": "<h2>Detroit vs. Protectionism?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Cars are the big one,\" President Trump told Fox News in July, explaining his evolving theory of easy-to-win <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether he meant cars are his leverage point to remake the world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> system according to some coherent vision, or simply the means to create a big show, with lots of fake drama and suspense, is an open question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps not that open: If one thing became clear through 14 campaign debates and two years of the Trump presidency, Mr. Trump does not do policy details. It's all just symbolism to him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A victory will be declared at the end of the day, of that you can be sure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His underlings, however, are obliged to give text to his impulses, and onlookers are obliged to try to make sense of the result. Let's start with the Mexico deal. It requires that 40% to 45% of a vehicle eligible for no-tariff treatment under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement be produced by workers making $16 or more an hour. It also requires that 75% (up from 62.5%) of a car's content be produced within the U.S. or Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first rule would shift production of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-eligible cars from Mexico to the U.S. The second would shift production from third countries (say South Korea, Germany or China) to the U.S. and Mexico. Yet the effect would be small. Only 27% of cars currently made in Mexico would be affected, and auto makers say adjusting won't be hard. Whether this means more U.S. jobs is uncertain. Car makers might prefer just to swallow the existing 2.5% tariff that applies to non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where those inclined to see method in Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> madness point to a pending Section 232 study by the Commerce Department, meant ludicrously to find that U.S. national security is threatened by auto-related imports, thereby allowing Mr. Trump to impose 25% duties on cars from Europe and Asia and possibly even Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Doing so would thoroughly disrupt global auto markets, driving up prices for U.S. consumers, and only eventually perhaps bring more auto investment to the U.S. A Mercedes or BMW from Germany might jump $10,000 in price; a Chevy Equinox, Dodge Caravan or Toyota RAV4 from Canada might jump $5,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Right now, such an outcome is unthinkable. Congress would hear from dealers and car buyers and throw itself athwart Mr. Trump's plan. Even the unions are ambivalent. In their public utterances, the Big Three -- Ford, GM and Chrysler -- are also opposed and presumably mean it, presumably.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Widely quoted was GM chief Mary Barra's apparently blanket statement on a conference call that \"we are free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs.\" Unfortunately her claim was preamble to a typically vague, noncommittal GM answer to an admirably precise question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question, by J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, is worth repeating: \"Has there been any scenario planning within GM that suggests that potential other changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could actually shake out positively for you? I know GM management stands for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but it seems to us that certain scenarios, such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> remaining but Section 232 tariffs applying to imported vehicles from outside the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bloc, that could actually end up being quite positive for you from a pricing or share perspective?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exactly. Protectionism can be quite profitable for companies that benefit from it, at least until they become fat and lazy and fall behind their overseas competitors in quality and technology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, in Trumpian fashion, has lots of balls in the air, and is proceeding chaotically as he did at times in his business. He may yet decide to go for broke. And Detroit, despite its investment in rising markets like China and its attachment to its global supply chains, could be the weak link in any resistance to a Trump impulse to turn the global car market upside-down.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly you wouldn't take to the bank anything that notoriously obfuscatory Detroit auto executives say about the matter right now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the blunt truths they are trained not to mention is that they embraced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the first place to use Mexico to level the playing field with foreign transplants that built their factories in the south to avoid the United Automobile Workers. Homegrown U.S. auto makers remain bound to the UAW while foreign-born ones in the U.S. enjoy a free labor market. This is a bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> distortion than any Mr. Trump is offering. It's also the cause of many other distortions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the Big Three's also-ran status in sedans is a legacy of John Dingell's \"anti-backsliding rule\" that for decades required them to build money-losing small cars in high-cost UAW factories. The Big Three's continuing dependence on excess pickup profits is a legacy of the 25% tariff on imported pickups that has evolved since the 1960s into Washington's main gift to prop up Detroit despite the many political burdens it must bear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So keep this history in mind. I wouldn't be 100% confident of Detroit turning up its nose at a big offer of Trump protectionism to solve all the headaches that continue to arise from Washington's 80-plus years of meddling in the car business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Holman W.

{"id": "928777892.xml", "text": "<h2>Barriers to Change, From Wall St. and Geneva</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EVEN now, after all we've been through, something is still wrong with Wall Street.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's the takeaway from the extraordinary -- and extraordinarily public -- resignation of Greg Smith from Goldman Sachs last week. His criticism of Goldman, made in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, suggested that some of the business practices and inherent conflicts in the financial industry are as troubling today as they were before all of those taxpayer bailouts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Goldman disagreed with him, of course. But Mr. Smith's Op-Ed article -- and the resounding response to it -- provide yet another reminder of why it is crucial that we remake our financial markets so that they are safe for investors and taxpayers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, the snail's-pace progress of this effort is worrisome. Financial institutions, eager to maintain their profitable status quo, have lobbied hard against change. As a result, too-big-to-fail institutions have become even bigger and more powerful.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to lobbying, big financial players have another potential weapon in their battle against safety and soundness. This one is more hidden from view and comes from, of all places, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in Geneva.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in the 1990s, when many in Washington -- and virtually everyone on Wall Street -- embraced the deregulation that helped lead to the recent crisis, a vast majority of W.T.O. nations made varying commitments to what's called the financial services agreement, which loosens rules governing banks and other such institutions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many countries, for instance, said they would not restrict the number of financial services companies in their territories. Many also pledged not to cap the total value of assets or transactions conducted by such companies. These pledges also appear to raise trouble for any country that tries to ban risky financial instruments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to the W.T.O., 125 of its 153 member countries have made varying degrees of commitments to the financial services agreement. Now, these pledges could easily be used to undermine new rules intended to make financial systems safer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What would happen if a country flouted the rules in an attempt to reduce risks in its financial system? Possibly nothing. Then again, that country could find itself subject to a challenge by the W.T.O.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, no countries have asked the organization to challenge rule changes like those made in the United States under the Dodd-Frank law. But rumblings of such an objection emerged in late December, in a comment letter sent to United States banking regulators. That letter criticized elements of the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent financial companies from making bets for themselves with deposits backed by taxpayers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The letter was written by the Investment Industry Association of Canada. It called the proposal \"an unprecedented reach of extra-territorial regulation.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The letter went on: \"As a result, the Volcker Rule may contravene the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement,\" a reference to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which has a broadly similar set of rules to the financial services agreement under the W.T.O. While countries must ask the W.T.O. to mount a challenge under its rules, companies can do so directly under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some countries that are trying to reregulate their financial systems worry that they may run afoul of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> commitments. The delegation for Barbados, for example, wrote last year about the trouble it might encounter imposing new rules while trying to abide by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The notion of 'too big to fail' has been a concern even prior to the crisis, but the financial crisis realized banking regulators' worst fears,\" Barbados wrote to a W.T.O. committee in early 2011.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet nations that committed to the agreement in the 1990s \"may find restrictions on size are contrary to the commitments given to limit adverse affects on financial service suppliers,\" the Barbados letter said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barbados suggested amending the agreement on financial services to provide more flexibility. Its proposal was rejected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last October, Ecuador asked that the W.T.O. review financial rules so that the country could preserve its ability to create regulations that ensure \"the integrity and stability of the financial system.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sounds reasonable enough. But that proposal was rejected by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representatives for the United States, the European Union and Canada before it could be discussed at a December meeting in Geneva. Through a spokeswoman, Ron Kirk, the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, declined to comment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe nothing will come of any of this. But such <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements might well be read as an invitation to fight financial regulation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One passage, for instance, begins sensibly enough: \"A member shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then it does a U-turn. \"Where such measures do not conform with the provisions of the agreement, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the member's commitments or obligations under the agreement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AS the Barbados delegation wrote in its February 2011 letter, \"An obligation not to restrict financial services in a situation where a member wishes to do so could be interpreted as having the intention of avoiding that obligation.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this represents yet another paradox of our financial world: Even as our regulators try to devise a safer financial system, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representatives thwart efforts to reduce risks these operations pose to taxpayers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Leadership, Mr. Smith wrote in his Op-Ed last Wednesday, is about \"doing the right thing.\" That applies off Wall Street, as well as on it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "2238012006.xml", "text": "<h2>The Overselling of Carlos Salinas</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was 1988 and everyone believed that it was morning again in Mexico. Carlos Salinas, a young, articulate, American-trained economist, had just been elected President of Mexico. He promised a brave new era of privatization, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and cordial relations with Washington. The old days of debt crises, money-losing state enterprises and anti-yanqui nationalism would be banished. Surrounded by like-minded technocrats with Ivy League connections, President Salinas would yank Mexico out of Latin America and drag it into the first world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Washington believed. Wall Street believed. Media cheerleaders believed. Eventually, most of Mexico believed. But things did not work out quite the way all those believers thought they would.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Salinas did align Mexico's economy far more closely with that of the United States, capping that achievement with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. He sold off hundreds of publicly owned companies, including the phone company, the national airline and leading banks, using some of the proceeds to reduce foreign debt.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By stemming the red ink from these companies, while using pro-government unions to keep wage settlements low and short-term foreign borrowing to keep the peso high, Mr. Salinas dramatically reduced inflation. For most of his term, international confidence in the Mexican economy soared and living standards, at least for the upper and middle classes, rose.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But almost as soon as he left office, much of his economic achievement unraveled. Reckless short-term borrowing had set up the peso for a precipitous fall. Foreign lenders took fright. Growth ground into reverse and living standards sharply declined. It has taken Mr. Salinas' less flashy successor, Ernesto Zedillo, more than a year to halt the slide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Zedillo is also an American-trained technocrat, and he has been carrying out an even more far-reaching agenda of reforms than his predecessor. But no one in Washington, Wall Street or Mexico City is now in any mood to tout new Mexican miracles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carlos Salinas was a genuine economic reformer. But he was also a privileged product and protector of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. He never challenged the PRI's taste for electoral fraud. In fact, PRI shenanigans may have given him his narrow victory margin in that 1988 presidential race. Mr. Salinas declared that his principal mission was to fix the economy and that cleaning up the political system could and should be put off to another day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States business community, delighted with his economic policies, happily bought his line. The Bush and Clinton Administrations, eager to lock in Mexican economic reforms by getting Congress to ratify <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, ignored or downplayed issues like electoral fraud, corruption and police tolerance of narcotics trafficking. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> gives American companies fairer access to Mexican markets and will continue to encourage the modernization of Mexico's economy. But Washington foolishly promoted it as a fast-acting cure-all that would instantly add jobs, lower <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits and prevent cross-border migration. Worse, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> became an excuse for overlooking America's equally strong interest in Mexican democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ignoring Mexico's political problems became harder after an armed peasant rebellion broke out in Chiapas in early 1994 and even more difficult after two of the country's leading political figures were assassinated later that year in cases that are still under judicial investigation. With Salinas business associates no longer protected by a friendly Government, Mexicans are learning that many were corrupt, pocketing fabulous sums from privatization and favoritism. Even worse, the former President's brother, Raul Salinas, has now been imprisoned on charges of commissioning political murder.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has learned some hard lessons from the Salinas episode; Washington must learn the same lessons. Supporting economic reforms in countries like Mexico obviously makes sense. But to do so uncritically, without paying attention to political reform, does not serve our interests or theirs.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1951409582.xml", "text": "<h2>Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to \"the ash heap of history,\" went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America's commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America's guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been \"losing,\" a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put \"America first\" while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America's reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America's standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.He did so despite the advice of his top people -- the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs -- who say the agreement is in America's interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can't abide his predecessor's accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America's word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?America's European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump's decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.Most economists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.If revoked or substantially renegotiated, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his \"base\" -- the voters troubled by economic decline -- by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise. It also undermines critically important global relationships, erodes American credibility and cedes influence and the investment opportunities that go with it to ambitious nations like China that are only too happy to fill the role.America First, Mr. Trump says.

{"id": "1862610489.xml", "text": "<h2>President Trump's Mexican Standoff; His approach to Pe\u00f1a Nieto suggests this is one adversary he fails to understand.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The author of \"The Art of the Deal\" has badly botched his first big one on the world stage, and not because he failed to stake out a tough position. In his effort to extract concessions from Mexico on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, President Trump has failed to understand his opponent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It isn't quite right to say that negotiations were scheduled to begin this week, with Mr. Trump hosting Mexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Washington. Mr. Trump has been negotiating since last year's campaign. His strategy has been to soften up the opponent with verbal abuse and extreme threats, including the possibility of tearing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The president-elect has done a wonderful job of preconditioning other countries [with] whom we will be negotiating that change is coming,\" Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross gloated during his Senate confirmation hearing. \"The peso didn't go down 35% by accident. Even the Canadian dollar has gotten somewhat weaker--also not an accident. He has done some of the work that we need to do in order to get better <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having witnessed his nation and its currency pummeled in the public square, the Mexican president was supposed to crawl to Washington and agree to whatever terms his U.S. counterpart put on the table. Maybe Mr. Trump should have Googled the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexicans are still smarting over that one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Mr. Trump told Mexico that a promise to pay for a border wall was a prerequisite for the scheduled meeting, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto canceled. The White House responded by saying it would extract the money for the wall with a 20% tariff on Mexican exports to the U.S. Of course American consumers would be the ones paying. But in any case it would be the end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have to hope their new president is not that reckless. Even the Soviets recognized that mutually assured destruction was a bad idea. A phone call between the two heads of state on Friday ended with both sides agreeing to future discussions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> cannot be dissolved without inflicting great harm on the country that Mr. Trump has sworn to protect. Mexico is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, and some six million American jobs rely on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the southern neighbor. According to the Agriculture Department, \"sales of food and farm products to Mexico totaled a record $19.5 billion in fiscal year 2014.\" That was 13% of U.S. agricultural exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump says that the U.S. has been outfoxed in manufacturing because American companies now make things in Mexico. But imports from Mexico contain significant American content, and production-sharing across the continent has given U.S. companies an edge in the global market. New tariffs on Mexican imports would damage that competitiveness and may result in retaliatory Mexican tariffs on U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legal experts say it isn't clear how much unilateral power Mr. Trump has to maneuver. Article 2205 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> allows the president to withdraw from the agreement. But it is being debated whether that would repeal the congressional legislation that put it into effect. If so, tariffs would revert to pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> levels, which implies using the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization tariff schedule. American exporters to Mexico would face greater tariff hikes than Mexican exporters to the U.S., because Mexico accepted much greater tariff reductions under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> than the U.S. did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Jan. 10 paper</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>from the international law firm White  Case says that its reading of the agreement and U.S. law \"implies that substantive modifications of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> outside of tariffs and rules of origin would require congressional authorization.\" The rules of origin--the share of a product that must be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-sourced--have changed several times already, and Mexico might agree to alter them again. But it has said that it won't budge on tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump might try to invoke the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 to slap his oft-promised punitive tariff on Mexican imports. But it is hard to argue that national security is being threatened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 45th president has said he wants to craft new bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Mexico says it is not interested. It has learned a hard lesson about relying on an unreliable partner, and its aim now is to diversify its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> portfolio.

Safety is, indeed, a serious concern for all trucks. However, Canadian trucks have been allowed into the United States since 1982 and must be U.S. licensed, meet the same safety and environmental norms as American trucks and be adequately insured. The drivers keep log books, undergo roadside inspections and comply with driving time limits. Mexican truckers have agreed to submit to the same strictures. If Mexican trucks are allowed freely into the U.S., Mexico has agreed under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to open its roads to U.S. trucks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall trucking safety on U.S. highways will be improved with a House vote last week to set aside $420 million over the next three years to boost the number of federal safety inspectors and tighten standards for trucks and drivers of any nationality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Currently, Mexican truckers may drive only along a narrow strip north of the U.S. border.

The Teamster-proposed ban slipped through the House as a rider to the motor-vehicle safety bill and is expected to pass the Senate. It has Clinton's support.

But the incipient war du jour is being postponed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the Trump administration is \u201cputting the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war on hold.\u201d The one with China, that is. Others can continue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The armistice-before-the-war is good news for farmers, who could use some. USA Today reports that the net income of U.S. farmers has fallen by more than half since 2013, to its lowest point since 2006, the steepest decline since the Depression. For this, blame productive farming around the world (supply outpacing demand), rotten weather in America, and perverse government in Washington. China and Mexico, responding to uncertainties caused by U.S. indignation (about China selling too much to consenting American adults, and about the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement enabling mighty Mexico to exploit America), are finding alternative sources of soybeans, pork and beef.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is nothing like a calamity for taking one's mind off one's troubles, and anti-immigration Republicans have another affliction for American farmers. The Wall Street Journal reports that about half of agriculture workers are undocumented immigrants. Because more Mexicans have left than entered the United States between 2009 and 2014, the immigrant agriculture labor force is aging \u2014 and moving to higher-paying construction jobs. The Journal: \u201cAs farmers struggle to find workers, more production has moved abroad. Avocado imports have doubled over the last eight years while U.S. production (measured by acreage) has declined by about a quarter. Since 1999, domestic production has fallen for oranges (by 36 percent), grapefruits (61 percent) and asparagus (69 percent). Imports of fresh fruits and vegetables have swelled. This hurts workers in related industries like transportation and food processing.\u201d This is the Republicans' approach to succoring \u201cvictims of globalization.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mortgage rates have risen to the highest level since 2011, they are far from done rising, and a National Association of Realtors economist says that every percentage-point increase can reduce home sales 7 to 8 percent. Simultaneously, the administration's protectionism is further increasing the cost of homeownership with tariffs on imported Canadian lumber (framing lumber is about 18 percent of the average new home's selling price). Bloomberg Businessweek says this adds an average of $1,360 to the cost of building a single-family home, the price of which has risen $6,388 since January 2017.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 1830s, in Grand Detour, Ill., a young blacksmith designed a self-scouring steel plow that could turn the Midwest's heavy black topsoil. John Deere then started a company and now his name is on big green machines everywhere. Today, however, the administration's steel tariffs are causing Deere & Co. to raise prices, which will injure its competitiveness, unless the demand for American machinery is price inelastic. Perhaps the Trump administration's protectionists, who know so much (how much Americans should consume of this and that import, and at what prices), know this about the machinery market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not content with bossing around Americans, even unto telling them which washing machines to buy, the administration's protectionists have demanded that Mexico, as part of a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, institute a $16 minimum wage for Mexican factory workers. So, a Republican administration purports to know more than Mexico's labor market knows about the proper price of Mexican labor. But, then, the last know-it-all administration so aggressive about controlling wages and prices was Republican (Richard Nixon's).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this dictating and renegotiating is supposed to protect American jobs from the menace of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> , which according to one of its ardent critics destroyed 1 million U.S. jobs in its first 20 years (1994-2014). An academic study argues that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China destroyed 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011. But Don Boudreaux of George Mason University's Mercatus Center says this means it took <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> two decades to destroy as many jobs as are erased by the normal churning of the American job market on average every 18 days.

He promises to undo the landmark achievements of his predecessor and build up Mexican industries at the expense of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, in short, bears more than a passing political resemblance to President Trump \u2014 which doesn't mean the two are likely to get along.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador wins the July 1 vote, bilateral relations already poisoned by Mr. Trump are likely to become still more toxic.

Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador says he favors a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with higher wages for Mexican workers, but many of his policies aim at curtailing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the United States, particularly in energy and agricultural products. He says he would reassess one landmark reform, the opening of Mexico's oil industry to foreign investment, and cancel another, an education revamp that broke the power of corrupt teachers' unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mexican voters appear likely to favor this reactionary agenda \u2014 and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador leads in polls by double digits \u2014 it is because they are fed up with the failures of recent centrist presidents, including the outgoing Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto promised to cut the murder rate in half; instead, it is now 25 percent higher than it was in 2011. Corruption has afflicted his administration, and economic growth has been sluggish.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto tried to reach out to Mr. Trump, hosting him in Mexico before the U.S. election despite fierce domestic criticism. Mr. Trump has repaid him by doubling down on racially tinged rhetoric about Mexican migrants, sending the National Guard to the border and demanding unreasonable changes in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, including a sunset clause. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has responded by canceling several bilateral meetings on military and anti-drug cooperation. With <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations stalled and Mr. Trump apparently set on making malice toward Mexico a campaign theme for the U.S. midterm elections, relations appear likely to worsen further before the next Mexican president takes office on Dec. 1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For now, many Mexicans are less worried about bad relations with the United States than the possibility that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador could lead the country back to the failed statist policies of the 1970s, or worse, the catastrophic \"21st-century socialism\" of Venezuela. Some of his aides are said to be close to the Venezuelan and Cuban governments, but as the election has approached, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has tacked toward the center.

{"id": "2095290808.xml", "text": "<h2>Is Trump making NAFTA better -- or worse? [Corrected 08/29/2018]</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As befits a real estate tycoon with a knack for getting attention, President Donald Trump sometimes amplifies the sizzle before securing the steak. His announcement of a deal with Mexico to revive the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement may turn out -- like his denuclearization agreement with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore -- to be more aspirational than tangible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative office, which negotiates <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, describes this one as \"a preliminary agreement in principle, subject to finalization and implementation.\" It's more like an engagement, then, than a wedding. The actual details may not match the claims. Any significant changes in the existing accord would require the approval of Congress, which is far from certain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which has Midwest manufacturers and farmers uneasy. The Trump administration professes to be in the process of improving <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts that in some ways do disadvantage U.S. exporters. Whether that broader effort, disruptive U.S. tariffs included, helps or hurts Americans remains an open question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That said, the announcement offers some grounds for hope. The USTR says the two sides agreed on protections against piracy and counterfeiting and safeguards for intellectual property and digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect in 1994, much of this realm -- including, for example, Amazon -- didn't exist, and the accord is overdue for updating to address new technologies and markets. The negotiators, we are told, also found common ground on commitments to protect marine species and stop illegal fishing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But these are not the areas that most animated the president's perennial attacks on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which he blames for the shift of some manufacturing, particularly in autos, from the United States to Mexico. What he claims to have achieved here is discouraging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The big change is an agreement to require 75 percent of the components of each car to be made in North America, up from 62.5 percent, and to mandate that at least 40 percent of production come from factories paying workers at least $16 an hour. Both dictates would interfere with established supply chains and raise costs for producers and consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump wanted the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement to expire after five years unless it was renewed by the signatories. That sort of provision sows uncertainty. Companies would be reluctant to make big capital investments knowing their markets might be taken away in just a few years. Omitting a sell date, by contrast, sends a signal that the parties are in for the long haul. In the end, the negotiators decided the deal will last 16 years, although with a mutual review after six years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A complicating element in the entire matter is Canada, the third party in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It did not participate in these negotiations and may not be amenable to the changes they produced. Trump said he wants to rename the pact the \"United States Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That may be mainly so Trump can say he kept his vow to get rid of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But he raised the specter of new tariffs -- or leaving Canada out of the new agreement entirely -- if the Ottawa government rejects the new provisions. Either option would be bad for consumers and producers on both sides of our northern border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Updating the current accord to cover topics that were neglected or unforeseen a quarter-century ago is a fine idea, as long as the focus remains on removing barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, opening markets for U.S. exports and fostering integration of the North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A big deal looking good with Mexico!\" the president tweeted Monday morning.

And I don't mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better.\" If our neighbors to the north and south did not agree to renegotiate, Mr. Trump added, then he would serve notice of American intent to exit the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that his administration has revealed its draft <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agenda, in the form of a letter to Congress from the acting U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, it would appear that Mr. Trump's bark had little relationship to his bite. In tone, the document is conciliatory. Its preamble takes note of the extensive trading relationships that have flowered under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and speaks of the great \"potential . . . benefit\" to the United States of \"improving\" it. In substance, it is conventional: a list of implicit but clear allusions to long-standing U.S. concerns such as domestic-content rules for the North American motor vehicle industry and Canada's protection of its dairy farms. One controversial point was a reference to \"snap back\" tariffs as a remedy for undue \"import surges\" to the United States. But even that mechanism has precedent in the terms of past <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, such as the ill-fated Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Speaking of TPP, which Mr. Trump also denounced, it actually would have accomplished a good deal of what the president now says he wants for the United States with respect to Canada and Mexico. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners agreed, in return for the benefits, economic and strategic, of what they hoped would be a U.S.-led market-building plan spanning a vast region of the world. Now that TPP has died, thanks in no small part to Mr. Trump's attacks on it during 2016, it's not clear what inducements he can offer Ottawa and Mexico City to make those same concessions again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the president's hostile and bombastic rhetoric -- especially toward Mexico -- has probably made it more difficult for the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries to deal with the United States, when the talks do commence some months from now. This is true even where the administration raises valid issues, such as its suggested update to automotive industry domestic-content rules, which may not necessarily reflect new supply chains linking Asia and North America, or the rise of a large Mexican auto industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's protectionism during the campaign was so over the top that any moderation now that he's in power is a relief. But the damage from his rhetoric won't be easily undone. Even by the notoriously demagogic standards of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> politics, Mr. Trump's vilification of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may set a record for being simultaneously inflammatory and -- we now know -- hollow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Today, however, there is growing legislative resistance to some broad powers that presidents possess because legislators improvidently - and, arguably, unconstitutionally - delegated them to presidents, particularly regarding international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) raises an issue that implicates constitutional issues that are even more fundamental than those addressed by the Portman-Jones-Ernst measure. President Trump might try to force congressional ratification of his United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) replacement of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement by terminating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This would confront Congress with an unpalatable choice: Embrace the USMCA or live without an agreement and with economic chaos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Toomey correctly argues that Congress cannot delegate the power to repeal statutes.

However, the president's power in foreign relations is plenaryexceptregarding commerce, where the president has no independent power and where the Constitution's commerce clause establishes Congress's primacy. Presidents can make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>treatiesthat must be consented to by two-thirds of the Senate.

Jackson said that presidential powers \"fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress,\" and presidential power is at its \"lowest ebb\" when the president acts against the \"express or implied will of Congress.\" That will is expressed, not merely implied, in congressional-executive agreements such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the Studebaker company expired in 1966, a Dictator model is displayed in South Bend's Studebaker Museum.

This looming fiasco is the result of the failed negotiating strategy of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rep Robert Lighthizer, who works for a deal-making President but can't seem to make a deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The missed deadline this week means there may not be enough time left in the Republican Congress to hold a vote, even in a lame-duck session. Good luck getting cooperation from Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi next year. It may also not be possible to get a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> text to the current Mexican Senate in time for a vote in its lame-duck session that ends August 30.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blame for this mess belongs to Mr. Lighthizer, who has overplayed his hand with excessive demands that have increased political opposition in Mexico, Canada and the U.S. They include a $16 minimum wage for Mexican factory workers, the end of international panels to protect U.S. investment abroad, and a five-year sunset provision, among others. Mr. Lighthizer persuaded President Trump that he could make a deal on these preposterous terms, but instead he's set up his boss for an embarrassing political and economic failure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He's also courting more economic trouble if Mexico elects economic nationalist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in its presidential election on July 1. AMLO, as he's known, wants to restore the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> corporatist Mexico, which was run by monopoly businesses and labor unions. AMLO is leading in the polls, and his Morena Party and its allies may have a majority in the new Mexican Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer will then have to negotiate with his mirror Mexican image. AMLO has promised to revisit recent energy reforms that opened Mexico to private domestic and foreign investment, and he waxes lyrical about the good old days of protected Mexican agriculture. When Mexico passed the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently, AMLO supporters in Congress voted against it. The opportunity to consolidate energy and telecom reforms using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> modernization will have been lost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rep is also setting Republicans up for losses in the midterm elections. The threat of retaliation against American farm products is a cause of great concern in farm states that are already struggling with low crop prices. Add the growing threats of retaliation from Japan and Europe over steel tariffs, and Chinese tariffs against U.S. farm goods, and Mr. Lighthizer could cost the GOP control of the House and Senate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer still has one potential self-rescue option if he's willing to come down from his personal Mount Olympus--a streamlined rewrite known as \"skinny <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" This would include limited changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that wouldn't alter U.S. law, and thus wouldn't require a vote in the U.S. Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> officials have largely completed new or revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> chapters on energy, digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, telecom, financial services, technical barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and customs, none of which need congressional approval. Changes to rules-of-origin in autos can also be made without a showdown vote in Congress, and Mexico has long signaled a willingness to compromise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto could sign skinny <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> by the end of May. Mexico's Senate would still have to approve it, but Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto could call the chamber back before the presidential election and get it passed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would be a significant victory for Mr. Trump. He would have locked in Mexico as an energy and telecom market for American companies, secured access to Mexican consumers for American farmers, expanded market access for financial services and laid down firm rules for digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. He will also have resolved great uncertainty in automobile production, while putting the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> issue behind him so he and his economic team can focus on China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The alternative is to hold fast to the Lighthizer poison pills that Mexico and Canada refuse to accept and settle in for what could be years of combat with a mercantilist Mexican government. That strategy puts at risk the present economic benefits of continental commerce and tens of billions of dollars of future sales and income gains for Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump wants to avoid that ugly legacy, he needs to order Mr. Lighthizer to cut a deal now, or get a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiator whose motto isn't the artlessness of no deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Potomac Watch Podcast</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Potomac Watch podcast: Trump's North Korea trial and a looming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> failure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "1872112688.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's Trade Reply to Trump</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico City -- Many conservatives who opposed Hillary Clinton are still skeptical of the Trump presidency as well. It may have something to do with recurring whoppers from the administration like White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's claim last week that \"the relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bilateral relations with Mexico are on the rocks \"big league,\" and if Mr. Spicer doesn't know that, he should get out more. Declaring otherwise undermines presidential credibility and leaves Trump fence-sitters to wonder what else the press secretary is making up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Millions of American workers, investors and entrepreneurs who depend on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and Canada under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement are right to be worried. Unless President Trump finds a way to climb down from his position that Mexico cheats the U.S. under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, their livelihoods are at risk.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Courteousness and formality are signs of good breeding in Mexican society and this often produces, in foreigners, illusions of approval. But when the extranjeros are out of earshot, locals can be colorful. It is now fashionable to hold protest marches, beat Trump pinatas, burn effigies with orange hair and even post vulgarities about the U.S. president on public buses. Angry does not begin to describe the popular mood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Feb. 23 visit from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly might have begun the repair process but was undermined by another Trump anti-Mexico rant in Washington the same day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Enrique Pena Nieto's government has adopted a diplomatic stance, with a disciplined message that defends Mexican dignity but doesn't give in to the same economic nationalism that defines Mr. Trump's agenda. Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's economy minister, is on the front lines. Earlier this month I caught up with him between events at the Sheraton Hotel here and asked what Americans should know about Mexico's position on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First,\" he said, \"I cannot accept the claim that only Mexico has been winning\" with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Rather, \"the facts prove that Mexico has been part of the solution for U.S. competitiveness.\" He reminded me that China's accession to the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 2001 triggered \"a great competitive challenge for everybody\" in manufacturing. Yet U.S. manufacturing from 1997-2015 still experienced real growth of 38% because of production sharing with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you \"separate U.S. manufacturing linked with Mexico from U.S. manufacturing not linked to Mexico,\" he said, the former maintained its output and grew, while the latter declined. This especially benefited the U.S. auto industry, according to the minister, who told me that 74% of investment in the North American auto sector went to the U.S. in 2015-16.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Guajardo does not reject the possibility of new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks: \"An agreement that is more than 20 years old has room for improvement and modernizing.\" Both energy and telecommunications, two industries that Mexico has opened to competition in recent years, he noted, could be added to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"explicitly.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mexico will proceed with caution. \"If we want to be successful, from day one we have to specifically define the objectives of this negotiation. If everything is up for grabs it will be disastrous,\" Mr. Guajardo said. \"If, for example, we reopen the tariff box, there will be an endless line in Washington and Mexico City to ask for protection. So we should not get mixed up with tariffs.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is open to re-evaluating aspects of the agreement that don't require congressional approval. One example is \"rules of origin,\" which define the percentage of regional content necessary for duty-free treatment inside <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But Mr. Guajardo believes the members ought to focus largely on \"how the world is changing\" as they \"face the digital era and the Industrial Revolution 4.0.\" He calls it \"myopic\" to tussle over \"700 jobs that may not exist in five years thanks to technological development.\" Better to \"see how we can integrate where the U.S. has tremendous strengths in research and development, innovation and new platforms.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's proclamations on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are supposed to have an aura of invincibility about them, as if he can dictate new rules for the agreement. Mr. Guajardo sees things differently. Mexico is now a democracy, and like the Americans and the Canadians, he says, he has to respond to domestic interests. Any changes will have to be \"win-win-win.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He will use the tools he has to retaliate against U.S. protectionism. But he also emphasized his government's goal, now four years in the making, to diversify Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by doing more business with Europe, Latin America and Asia. Brazil, he observed, is a strong agricultural producer eager to compete with American farmers in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Returning Mr. Trump's rudeness with rudeness is not in the Mexican playbook. But Mexico isn't about to capitulate to this U.S. president either.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "399086331.xml", "text": "<h2>WEEKEND JOURNAL; Entertainment &amp; Culture -- Review / Television: Birth of a Backlash</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long months before two \"Saturday Night Live\" skits lampooned a media besotted with Barack Obama -- the deathless eloquence of his speeches, his cool, his grace, his swooning crowds -- a large audience of Americans had begun to grasp the import of the daily drip drip drip of this infatuation on the part of journalists and commentators, and their equally obvious coldness, to put it mildly, to Sen. Obama's competitor Hillary Clinton. It was hard to miss. Finally, in the past few days, journalists seem to have reacted to the adroit skewering they took in the SNL skits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few began peppering Sen. Obama with queries more difficult than he was accustomed to, about delicate matters like the question of Louis Farrakhan's support, and hotter ones concerning his campaign's evasive responses with regard to a visit to the Canadian Embassy by an Obama adviser. A meeting in which assurances were reportedly made that Sen. Obama's denunciations of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement should be viewed in the light of the political season and its requirements. Those requirements, simply stated, mean that inveighing against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is important for candidates running in states, like Ohio, where that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement is considered poison and the cause of job losses. (Unless the candidate is John McCain, a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r who supports <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and doesn't care where he says it.) And then there were questions about Mr. Obama's dealings with Tony Rezko, a major political donor now on trial for influence-peddling -- too many questions. Apparently unaccustomed to such persistence from reporters on these issues, the visibly irate candidate walked away, but not before charging that he had already answered eight questions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A diligent if hopeless search of media commentary on this exchange turned up no charges that Sen. Obama was \"whining\" -- a description TV pundits and analysts have frequently tossed at Sen. Clinton. It did her no good, one sage grimly warned after the last debate, for Hillary Clinton to have whined about being asked the first question all the time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe not, but ultimately it may have done her considerable good to be on the receiving end, continuously, of confidently contemptuous descriptions of her performances on the campaign trail. Also doing her good, finally, were all those recitals, by pundits and reporters, of her bleak chances -- particularly compared with the celebratory tones accompanying reports on Mr. Obama's crowds and his prospects, not to mention occasions like his endorsement by top stars of the Kennedy clan -- with its resulting suggestion that a successor to JFK now walked among us. There was Ted, then there was Caroline Kennedy -- endorsing Barack Obama at the suggestion of her children, as we were informed with curious emphasis. Maria Shriver, first lady of California, came forward with her own endorsement not long after, because, as she explained, she had awakened that very morning compelled by inner necessity to make this public announcement. Which she had willingly done, she confided, without even getting her hair and makeup done. All this the breathless media reported with the kind of rapture and intensity last seen, perhaps, during the nuptials of Charles and Diana.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And all this in the end did Hillary Clinton good, however it may have felt, because her treatment by the media did not go unnoticed by voting Americans -- among them, certainly, the crowds who turned out for her in Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island. The SNL skits sharpened the point -- but they didn't come as news. They were confirmation of that which the public could feel and hear every day, those assumptions that drove so much of the media's view of Hillary Clinton: She was the old politics, she failed to connect with people, she was, above all, not Barack Obama and she should get out. Indeed, she may have failed to connect, to keep herself on consistent message -- she has become, in her desperate recent months, a raging class warrior, John Edwards- style. Nor does she have much by way of oratorical gifts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, she had one important power quietly working its magic for her and bringing out her voters. She had that army of pundits and journalists condescending to her, sniping, harrying her -- particularly in the past week -- to drop out, to give up, to let Mr. Obama concentrate on the battle. Jonathan Alter of Newsweek and MSNBC merits top laurels for his passionate dedication to this cause, which he advanced with infinitely detailed mathematical proofs that she could never prevail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It helped, as well, for the public to have witnessed spectacles like the night of the Wisconsin primary, when every one of the cable news networks covered Mr. Obama's 40-minute-long stemwinder in full. An executive at one of the channels explained that these were individual producers' judgments, while admitting, along the way, that there was something to the proposition that none of the networks had the temerity to cut away from an Obama speech however long it went on. The night of this contest, only CNN saw fit to return to Hillary Clinton, after the Obama speech ended, and broadcast chunks of her post-primary address, delivered earlier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, it helped for the viewing public to have heard comments like Chris Matthews's heartfelt, if slightly delirious, reference -- by now forever enshrined in cultural memory -- to the thrill that ran up his leg when he heard an Obama speech.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's a lot to be said for a confessional mode that captures the spirit of the times so acutely. The same can't be said for an admission, by NBC reporter Lee Cowan, that told more than he intended. In an interview with his boss, Brian Williams, Mr. Cowan said that from a reporter's point of view it was almost hard to be objective about Obama. Mr. Cowan reports on the Obama campaign for NBC and, it should be said, seemed to have grasped that objectivity was valuable for a journalist. So far so good. He then went on to describe the infectious energy of the crowds, how they were growing -- and Mr. Obama's energy along with them -- and how remarkable it all was. Perhaps carried off by now, what with all this infectiousness, the reporter went on to note that the kinds of people who came to Obama rallies were themselves exceptional. \"We see crowds that are not typical folks,\" he marveled -- they were the sorts who hoist their children to their shoulders, who want to see the phenomenon, who know it's not cool if you haven't seen Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was more, none of it altogether coherent, but the tone brought home the essential truth about this sort of reporting, in which values once cherished in journalism -- the skeptic's eye, the outsider's sensibility -- are casually subordinated to the appeal of the confessional, to being in the swim, open to the moment. So much so that the reporter can view the very audiences packing Mr. Obama's rallies as extraordinary people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this is, of course, Mr. Obama's fault. He has merely been the beneficiary of adulation run amok in a large quarter of the media. We can now contemplate the strange and wonderful role that the media and their forecasts of Hillary Clinton's doom played on Tuesday -- a political resurrection story not exactly the equal of John McCain's, perhaps, but one we'll remember for a long time to come.</p>\n"}
{"id": "421365861.xml", "text": "<h2>Commentary; Zedillo Should Have Aimed Higher; California trip: If the Mexican president had gone beyond the photo ops, he would have made points, both here and at home.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When all the Mexican president's men (and one woman) met to plan his visit to California they were roughly divided into two groups: those who thought President Ernesto Zedillo should look at the future and those who remembered the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The futurists wanted a long and triumphal tour of the state with at least two major public appearances. Those with long memories wanted a quick one-day visit, with no crowds. In typical fashion, the president gave each a bit and that is why the presidential trip to California ends today on its third day--with only tightly controlled public appearances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Zedillo's main goal was to mend a strained relationship with the state that is arguably the most important of the 50 American states for his nation of almost 100 million people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is because 2.2 million Mexican citizens are legal residents of California, and California exports more goods to Mexico than to Japan or Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet even as Zedillo and California Gov. Gray Davis accentuated the positive, groups that disagree with Zedillo's policies made their disagreement known with protest demonstrations during his visit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a decade, that has been par for the course whenever Mexican leaders visit California. It was first noted in 1986, when former Mexican Secretary of the Interior Manuel Bartlett came to Los Angeles to represent then-President Miguel de la Madrid in the traditional Mexican Independence \"El Grito\" ceremony. That night, on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall, more than 15,000 angry Mexicans jeered Bartlett, holding him personally responsible (as the cabinet minister charged with overseeing Mexico's elections) for the widely reported fraud that had taken place earlier that year in a gubernatorial election in the state of Chihuahua.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A different kind of protester greeted former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari when he visited the state three times in the 1990s. He was warmly welcomed by business leaders and local authorities at the official ceremonies but booed by human rights activists, union members and environmentalists who followed him from one reception to the other.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How could Zedillo escape a similar fate? For labor and environmentalist groups, the government he leads is the same one that has enforced the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement negotiated by Salinas. In their view, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has turned Mexico into either one big sweatshop or one big toxic dump. While some of their concerns are valid, it must be remembered that were it not for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico would be in an even bigger economic mess today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then come the California Zapatistas and the human rights activists who oppose Zedillo's Chiapas policy. Some claim Mexico has become the worst human rights violator in the hemisphere as it struggles to control an insurgency by the Zapatista rebels in the southern state of Chiapas. They point to incidents like the killing of 45 civilians in the village of Acteal in December 1997 by pro-government paramilitary forces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In all fairness, it must be noted that the blame for the ongoing standoff in Chiapas must be shared by both sides. The government has failed to live up to the peace agreements signed so far. But Zapatista leaders, especially the famous Subcomandante Marcos, have also done little to help shape a lasting peace in Chiapas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there are the members of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD. They oppose Zedillo and every other Mexican politician affiliated with his Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, who, they are convinced, stole the 1988 Mexican election from the PRD's best-known leader, Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is gearing up for another run at the presidency in 2000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, anyone who has a beef with the Mexican government tried to make their unhappiness known to Zedillo while he was in the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would have been gutsy and daring--and not necessarily disastrous--to have had Zedillo pay a surprise visit to a place where Mexicans here gather, like Grand Central Market downtown or Pacific Avenue in Huntington Park. My bet is he would have come out of it energized, not booed. After all, the perception among his countrymen in the U.S. is that former Gov. Pete Wilson was the enemy, and Zedillo could have looked like the champion in the fight for their rights.

{"id": "1908256783.xml", "text": "<h2>A deal with a bad aftertaste</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THERE IS good news and bad news in U.S.-Mexico relations. Unfortunately, they're the same news: The Trump administration and the Mexican government have reached a new agreement on access to the United States for Mexican sugar producers. This is good news because it avoids an impending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war over the commodity, thus preserving a modicum of good relations leading into negotiations over updating the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). It's bad news because the whole business perpetuates a system of market manipulations that hurts American consumers of the commodity while benefiting no one but a well-connected few who produce it in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the core of those market manipulations for many years has been a series of per-country import quotas that permit only certain quantities of raw sugar to enter the United States from various nations. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> changed that by granting Mexico's sugar producers free access to the U.S. market, though the access didn't actually kick in until the Obama administration, some 15 years after the agreement's adoption. Nevertheless, by 2014, Mexico had come to supply a large portion of the U.S. market, at which point American refiners lodged a complaint with the Commerce Department, accusing the Mexicans of \"dumping\" subsidized sugar and sending too much of it in refined form.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to the threat of punitive tariffs, Mexico agreed to limit refined sugar shipments and accepted minimum prices; even that wasn't good enough for American industry, however. The latest deal, struck by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, essentially tightens those supply limitations and further increases minimum prices. It's a major concession by Mexico for the sake of good bilateral relations, though American producers say they still aren't completely happy with it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you're wondering how these elaborate protections for sugar producers can possibly benefit the far larger number of sugar consumers, well, we are, too. The truth is that Americans as a whole would be better off if there were global free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in sugar, not just free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Mexico. Would that cost jobs in the sugar industry? Maybe. But it is certain that the protectionist system kills thousands of jobs in sugar-using industries, whose costs of production are forced up by these pointless, politically driven market interventions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Things have come to quite a point when the only way to save a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement is by enforcing less-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. But that is what is happening: Mexico's sugar exporters are being forced to accept a version of the country-by-country quota system they thought they had negotiated their way out of, fair and square, back when everyone signed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a quarter-century ago. Yet managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of that sort appears to be what President Trump means by \"fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" though we don't understand what's fair about determining market share through haggling among bureaucrats rather than supply and demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

If Mr. Lighthizer is predicting that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 will be ratified by Congress before the end of this year, odds are he's overly optimistic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" Congress gives the president requires him to notify Capitol Hill of his intention to sign a deal 90 days before doing so. Even if all three parties agree on a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> by the end of this month, the signing ceremony would be in late November. What is more, the full text isn't likely to be available for at least a month after notification is given. And it couldn't go to Congress for a vote until the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission releases a report on its economic impact, which can take up to 105 days from the release of the full text.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At that point debate on the contents of the new agreement would begin. You do the math: There simply aren't enough pages left on the calendar to ratify a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in this Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's baffling why the Trump administration is raising expectations that it will soon end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> uncertainty when it must know it can't deliver. One theory is that it is part of an effort to increase pressure on Canada and Mexico for an August deal in principle, allowing the administration to claim success ahead of November's midterm elections. But that will still be a long way from completing a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was in Washington to continue negotiations. Press reports citing unnamed sources said that the two sides were getting closer to an agreement on how to modify auto-sector \"rules of origin,\" which dictate how much of a vehicle must be made in North America to qualify as duty-free when it crosses continental borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In May, Team Trump proposed a new North American content requirement of 75%, up from the current 62.5%. It also wanted a new requirement that 70% of the steel and aluminum in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vehicles be North American and new wage regulations that would require 40% of the value of North American cars and sport-utility vehicles -- and 45% of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> trucks -- be produced by workers making between $16 and $19 an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico countered with 70% North American content, a 30% regional steel requirement and 20% regional aluminum. Market-based labor rates are important for Mexican competitiveness, but Mexico showed flexibility by proposing $16 an hour for 20% of the value of vehicles it makes. The U.S. rejected that offer. Now the two sides are trying to find middle ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that negotiations on many other chapters expected to be included in a new agreement (e.g., intellectual property) still aren't finished. Canada hasn't been part of talks in recent weeks, though Mr. Guajardo said last week that his negotiations are based on a trilateral agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will turn the presidential sash over to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Dec. 1. Word has it that Mr. Pena Nieto wants to sign the renegotiated deal before he leaves office. He and Mr. Trump are helped by the stated support of Mr. Lopez Obrador -- who is focused largely on avoiding anything that would spark a selloff of the peso -- for completing the negotiations during this government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the 90-day window closing, Mr. Pena Nieto may be more amenable to U.S. demands. But Mexico isn't without leverage. Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars haven't been popular among Republicans in Congress and in the heartland. With the midterm elections looming, Mr. Art of the Deal needs to show that he can close, which means the U.S. also has to show flexibility.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada reject the U.S. proposition of a five-year sunset clause, and both are adamant about protecting key aspects of the existing agreement. That includes Chapter 19, which provides a mechanism for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners to challenge antidumping and countervailing duties. Most analysts expect Mexico and Canada to hold their ground on these issues for reasons of domestic politics and economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Mexico and Canada don't have an easy path. If they bend too much to Mr. Lighthizer's demands, the deal could damage continental competitiveness. But it also has to be politically viable in the U.S. If Democrats get control of the House in November, Mr. Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could wind up signing an agreement Democrats refuse to ratify. Remember when Nancy Pelosi put George W. Bush's U.S.-Colombia Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement in a drawer? How Mr. Trump would respond to that is anybody's guess.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "1922329421.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump and the Nafta Talks; The administration's objectives are largely constructive. But beware of land mines.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No part of Donald Trump's 2016 run for president excited crowds more than his rants against Mexico, his promises to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, to make the neighbors pay for it, and to rewrite or scrap the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rhetorically, President Trump has not stepped back very far from all that. He now says that he will build the wall first and figure how to get the money from Mexico later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understands that he won the presidency partly by making outrageous statements that kept him constantly in the news. But now that the serious business of negotiation on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is beginning, it appears that much of the craziness has been set aside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada have agreed to return to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table, and most of the objectives outlined in the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative's summary, released</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>last week, are aimed not at destroying the 24-year-old pact but modernizing it. In many cases the U.S. is asking to open markets further on a reciprocal basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One objective is freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in agricultural products, which suggests that Canada's protected dairy and poultry markets will be on the table. The document also says the U.S. will aim for greater ease at the borders by \"streamlining\" customs procedures. A specific goal is to raise the value of goods that can enter duty-free in express-mail shipping to $800 from $50. The USTR doesn't make a big point of it, but this mail would presumably include products made in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately some items on the Trump wish list would take the region backward economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hardly surprising that the administration has made it a priority to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada. It has the same wrongheaded obsession globally. But as the Journal explained in a March 10 editorial</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>, \"How to Think About the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Deficit,\" a current-account deficit--which includes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>--doesn't matter because it means there is a capital-account surplus. The dollars Americans spend on foreign-produced goods and services eventually must return to the U.S., usually via investments in U.S. assets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada are even less relevant. In the introduction to its summary, the USTR claims that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits have exploded.\" Yet the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners is less than 13% of the total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> represents 30% of total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Canada and Mexico are the largest export markets for the U.S., and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits are nowhere proportional. It is also worth noting that the U.S. has had a surplus in services with Mexico averaging about $9 billion a year over the past three years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the goods side--despite all the griping about deficits with Mexico and Canada--continental free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes U.S. exports more attractive globally. By putting production facilities in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, American auto manufacturers, for example, can turn out cars and trucks that compete on price and quality all over the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reduces the overall U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. All things being equal, the deficit would go down even more if all markets were further opened to U.S. exports. It follows that the ideal U.S. policy for an administration concerned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits would be to work to reduce all barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a world of increasingly interconnected commerce supported by free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, American protectionists have come to rely heavily on antidumping and countervailing duties. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, when exporters are alleged to be selling unfairly--leaning on government subsidies or pricing a product below market to destroy competitors--any of the three countries can apply duties as a remedy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, exporters can appeal those duties to an international arbitration panel. The USTR says it wants to eliminate Chapter 19 and instead send disputes to domestic courts. In the U.S. that would be the Court of International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, where the Trump administration and its supporters undoubtedly feel American companies could expect a more favorable outcome than at a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet this would also mean that when Canada and Mexico slap antidumping duties on American products, exporters will have to go to domestic courts in those countries. The result is likely to be rising protectionism in all three markets and sand in the gears of the integrated North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This can only increase divisions, beyond economics, among the three countries at a time when a strong North American alliance is crucial to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere. Mexico has adopted a welcome human-rights policy by taking a strong position against the Venezuelan dictatorship. The U.S. should do what it can to build on this common ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USTR's objectives are largely constructive. But Trump protectionists have planted a few land mines in the otherwise valuable agenda. Americans have to hope that Canada and Mexico will defend the interests that all three partners have in a free and prosperous North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "398470479.xml", "text": "<h2>The outlook: Free-trade idea needs a dominant champion</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NEW YORK -- The strenuous effort required to push the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement through Congress and the tedious seven years of haggling over a still-unresolved global accord clearly indicate that the whole notion of reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers is in serious trouble.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally clear are some sources of that trouble: the slow growth of most of the world's major economies, increased competition from developing countries, global excess capacity in most industries and, as a result of all these forces, the politically disruptive weakness of job markets around the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But another, little-noted problem may also undermine further attempts to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and even to keep commerce as open as it is now. No one is in a dominant position to impose free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only twice in history has free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had such a powerful advocate, according to Susan B. Stanton, an economist at A. Gary Shilling & Co. She cites the mid-19th century, when Britain reigned supreme, and the decades following World War II, when the U.S. did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, she writes in the consulting firm's newsletter, \"these two eras clearly demonstrate several common threads which to some extent tarnish their golden image: First, in each, one country was in a peculiarly powerful position to pursue its own particular political and economic goals -- goals which free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> happened to suit; second, undercurrents of protection were never far from the surface; and third, those protectionist sentiments easily broke through to return as the order of the day when the pressure of competition and of slow economic growth weakened the power of the world's leader.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Early in the 19th century, Ms. Stanton notes, protectionism was the norm; many countries prohibited imports of manufactured goods. But then Britain took advantage of its \"industrial head start\" and began liberalizing its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in a search for markets for its greatly increased production. After a while, other industrializing nations followed what they saw as its path to prosperity and negotiated liberal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. But production expanded, competition grew, the search for markets intensified, and many of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts expired in the 1890s. The 19th-century tensions, Ms. Stanton writes, led to World War I.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 and amid the Depression, President Roosevelt began liberalizing U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. And after World War II, Ms. Stanton writes, \"the U.S., like 19th-century Britain, was in a unique position to push for liberal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" It had \"vastly expanded its industrial base during the war years,\" and it bore the cost of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to help rebuild other nations' economies and fortify Cold War allies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even then, protectionism lingered. Like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the many customs unions and free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs formed during the postwar period invariably included \"escape\" clauses to soften any blows. And the blocs protected their members against nonmembers, much as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> includes domestic-content provisions aimed at curbing \"back-door\" imports from Japan and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in the 1970s, the Bretton Woods monetary agreement collapsed, and with it stable currency rates. The oil shocks and surging inflation further rattled financial markets. As other industrial nations, notably Japan, grew stronger, international competition sharpened. The ending of the Soviet threat weakened the Western alliances. And developing nations stepped up exports of manufactured goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, the world's economies are facing this startling array of changes without a dominant nation able to uphold free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Moreover, the economic problems spawned by these changes and encouraging protectionism are likely to get worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Cos., notes, \"The sudden entry of three billion people from low-wage economies such as China, Mexico and India into the global marketplace for goods industries and services is provoking new concerns among workers in the old industrial countries\" about their living standards. He also observes that \"demographers project that practically all of the growth in the world labor supply during the next half-century will occur in the developing nations.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New technology will play a major role, too. The invasion of developing-world competitors into the marketplace will be facilitated by continuing improvements in world-wide communications. And almost across the board, technological change will keep wiping out some jobs while creating new ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people will blame the resulting turmoil in various industries and job markets on foreign competition. And in industrial nations, that general malaise may well be aggravated by widespread fears of terrorist attacks -- an environment that would create a sense of being under siege. Without a dominant nation with the economic power and self-interest to demand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, these pressures, Ms. Stanton writes, will encourage protectionism and \"the formation of inward-looking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs\" as \"the individual domestic needs of countries overwhelm their international outlook.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A growth of protectionism wouldn't necessarily cause a disastrous drop in global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, however. \"The increase in protectionism after 1870 did not prevent a sustained expansion of world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" Mr. Hale says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if protectionism spreads, unchecked by a strong, persistent free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> champion, the growth of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could slow down in coming decades. And the world's economies would pay a heavy price.</p>\n"}

These do not threaten their existence, yet they can represent major challenges to their welfare and integrity. Mexico may be on the verge of such a perfect storm as it enters a new year fraught with multiple perils and few opportunities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three dark clouds threaten Mexico\u2019s future in 2018: Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the possible end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and a presidential election that may introduce an era of turmoil and uncertainty for the economy and Mexican society at large.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first threat has little to do with Mexico\u2019s policies or control of its destiny. Whatever one thinks of the new tax regime in the United States, there is little question that it belongs strictly to the American domestic policy realm, unlike immigration policy, which has been the subject of several agreements between the United States and, among others, Mexico and Cuba.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, with regard to tax policy, the problem for the United States\u2019 neighbors lies in the consequences it may have on their domestic economies. This is a typical internal economic policy issue of the United States, like raising or lowering interest rates, with major international repercussions. For Mexico, it is quite likely, economists say, that Trump\u2019s tax reform entails three significant downsides .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, Mexican conglomerates may decide to move their headquarters and legal residence to the United States to take advantage of a now much lower corporate tax rate (30 percent in Mexico versus 21 percent in the United States).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While this would not necessarily transfer jobs from one country to the other, it may discourage foreign, or even national, investment in Mexico. If big Mexican multinationals such as Cemex, Bimbo, Televisa or Mexichem were to relocate north of the border, why shouldn\u2019t smaller companies, or potential newcomers, do the same?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, American corporations with large investments in Mexico might decide to take advantage of other favorable provisions aside from the tax rate differential in the tax overhaul and repatriate money and jobs to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the tax package could easily dissuade American firms from investing in Mexico \u2014 which is partly what it was meant to do, even if it ultimately did not include a border tax or a value-added tax. As it is, direct foreign investment in Mexico has been either stagnant or dropping (especially as a share of gross domestic product) over the past couple of years; this might bring on a drastic reduction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Theoretically, Mexico could counter all this with its own Trump-like tax changes \u2014 except that the blow to government revenues would be devastating. As it is, Mexico has one of the lowest tax rates among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Lowering them would create a severe fiscal problem. Especially since south of the border, few serious people believe that cutting taxes raises revenues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second ominous possibility lurking on Mexico\u2019s horizon is the end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> , or, at best, the indefinite postponement of renegotiation, perpetuating uncertainty. Talks are scheduled through March or April. But given Mexican presidential elections on July 1, and a United States midterm vote in November, it would be impossible for a hypothetical agreement to be ratified by both Congresses, and perhaps the Canadian Parliament, before early 2019.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would deter foreign investment at least until the new rules are determined and also allow the Trump administration to continue to threaten a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> blowup to obtain concessions from Mexico on other issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\u201cHypothetical\u201d is a big word. Such little progress has been made on America\u2019s stringent demands that there is no agreement in sight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration wants the so-called rules of origin renegotiated, requiring, for example, that at least 50 percent of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-produced car be made of American parts. Washington also wants disputes settled in American courts (and not in the more neutral arbitration bodies set up by the treaty), limits on the export of some agricultural products from Mexico to the United States, and the entire agreement revisited every five years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With these sticking points hanging over the talks, President Trump\u2019s negotiators may any day invoke <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\u2019s Article 2205, which provides for a signatory\u2019s exit from the treaty in six months.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mexico will survive without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the impact on foreign investment, much more than on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, would be devastating for the first few years. This is not good news for an economy that is expected to grow less than 2 percent in 2018, and has expanded recently at an average rate of barely 2 percent per year. Lower growth means less employment, which, among other things, could prompt greater emigration from Mexico to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The third squall ahead lies in the presidential election. This will be the fifth consecutive democratic vote for Mexico: a first in its history. That in itself is a major achievement. And the election promises to be fundamentally free and fair: another accomplishment. But the outcome, at least according to most current polls, promises to be problematic. The reason is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the left-wing politician and presidential candidate better known as AMLO.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is not so much whether Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, the former mayor of Mexico City, will win \u2014 he is a clear front-runner \u2014 but rather whether the domestic and foreign business communities believe he will. They appear to, and are already acting in consequence, generating the beginnings of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Similarly, predictions of his being another Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or Luis Echeverr\u00eda (Mexico\u2019s populist president of the 1970s) may or may not be valid; the question is whether investors trust those forecasts. They seem to, and are either delaying projects in the pipeline or postponing new ones until after the election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many expect that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will indeed attempt to keep many of his promises. These range from a de facto reversal of energy reform and canceling construction of a new airport in Mexico City to higher (necessary) spending on fighting poverty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of his most intriguing recent commitments, amnesty for drug-cultivating peasants and engaging in conversations with cartel kingpins, while innovative and bold, might be considered anathema in Washington. Again, these promises may be red herrings, so to speak, but if enough decision-makers subscribe to them, their effect is the same as if they came true.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these three clouds imply for Mexico is a protracted period of insignificant growth after a long period of mediocre growth. They probably entail more drug production, migration and violence. Poverty and inequality, which have both shrunk slightly over the past 15 years, will rise again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this is good news for Mexico. Under ideal international circumstances, that would be formidable challenge; with Donald Trump in the White House, it can be a nightmare. Other than believing in miracles \u2014 the United States economy, as opposed to Wall Street, is on the cusp of an extraordinary boom; China will come to Mexico\u2019s rescue; eradicating corruption in Mexico will solve all problems \u2014 there are no credible alternatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A pity that Mexico proved unable to take advantage of its last 25 years of good fortune in dealing with the United States. Now only God and the Virgin of Guadalupe can help.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Source URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/opinion/mexico-tax-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-lopez-obrador.html?partner=bloomberg</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JORGE G.

{"id": "409956892.xml", "text": "<h2>Northern Ire; Canadian Politics Are All About America</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PUBLISHED CORRECTIONS: A Jan. 8 Outlook article about anti- Americanism in Canadian politics incorrectly implied that new U.S. passport requirements for all travelers, including U.S. and Canadian citizens, crossing into the United States are already in effect. According to the State Department consular Web site, the requirements, which will be phased in, begin to go into effect at the end of 2006. (Published 1/12/2006)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Barely 18 months ago, Canadian party leaders were out campaigning for better health care policies, a cure for Quebec's nationalist aspirations and an end to government corruption scandals. But since the minority government put in place in June 2004 lost a no- confidence vote late last November, the politicians have been back out on the stump, preparing for a new election on Jan. 23. This time, though, running in the two coldest months of winter, they've been using that familiar demon  --  the United States and all its evils  --  as the fuel to heat Canadian voters to a frenzy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no denying that Canadians are in an even more anti- American mood than usual, thanks to the Iraq war and the Bush administration's perceived arrogance. And politicians here are playing to that mood. In a blatant appeal for votes, candidates of every stripe, led by Prime Minister Paul Martin and his ruling Liberal Party, are taking aim at Washington, blasting it for taxing Canadian lumber imports, for failing to fight global warming, for lax gun-control laws, for dealing inappropriately with the war on terrorism. And all the while, they're studiously ignoring Canada's own homegrown issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America-bashing became such a central part of the election landscape last month that U.S. ambassador David H. Wilkins warned that Canadian-American relations could take a turn for the worse if party leaders didn't back off. But his words only prompted Canadian politicians to lash back with admonitions of their own. Even Stephen Harper, leader of the Conservatives, the party generally most sympathetic to the United States, declared: \"I don't think foreign ambassadors should be expressing their views or intervening in an election.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In keeping with a long political tradition, the United States ignores Canada whenever possible. Nonetheless, the issues between the two countries just keep piling up. Leading the way is the softwood lumber dispute. Three years ago, the United States began imposing import duties on Canadian lumber after American producers complained that the Canadian government was all but subsidizing the lumber industry. Canada objected, and last August, arbitrators for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement decided in its favor. But Americans still have not fully complied with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ruling to lift the duties, so Prime Minister Martin has made confronting Washington on this score a main issue of his campaign, even though lumber represents less than 3 percent of Canadian exports to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While American non-compliance with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may be a legitimate beef for Canadians, politicians have also been indulging in some inflated rhetoric on other fronts where Canada isn't on such solid ground. The specific attack to which Wilkins responded, for example, had to do with the Kyoto environmental accord. In welcoming a United Nations conference on global warming in Montreal last month, Martin criticized the United States for not signing the agreement and urged it to pay attention to the \"global conscience.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing so, he conveniently neglected to mention that Canada, which is one of the accord's major promoters, so far hasn't complied with its emission reduction requirements. The United States, in fact, has done a better job in dealing with greenhouse gases. A U.S. Department of Energy report released in December noted that American emissions for 2004 were 16 percent higher than in 1990. A similar study prepared by Environment Canada reported that greenhouse gas emissions rose 24 percent here between 1990 and 2003. But in the current election environment, the prime minister knows that it is hot air that really counts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Liberal Party has been determined to divert attention from a corruption scandal that has left it weakened in every province. It is using its anti-American foreign policy as an election tool, continuously reminding Canadians that the Liberal government kept the country out of the Iraq war and the North American missile defense system. Some pundits say that Martin, with no ammunition against opposition candidates, has decided to run against George W. Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The opposition has also played the America card. The Conservatives, who support deep tax cuts, Thatcheresque deregulation of the economy and a set of family values that could attract the vote of any evangelical minister, are sympathetic with Bush's foreign policies but vow never to mimic them. At the other end of the spectrum, the quasi-socialist New Democratic Party has candidates who are so anti-American that they sometimes sound like an undergraduate student forum, performing stunts such as conducting \"citizens' weapons inspections\" of American military bases in Washington state. The one thing all the candidates have in common is their strenuous assertions that they will not tolerate being bullied, even if they have to make up the bullying.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although the government boasts about its non-cooperation with the Americans on Iraq, it is desperate to keep quiet its cooperation on the war on terrorism. Under the Liberals, Canada enacted Patriot Act- style legislation with the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001. Recently, it resisted calls to repeal provisions for increased police surveillance and far-reaching powers of arrest and detention. Federal authorities are currently holding five suspects under so- called security certificates, which allow non-Canadians to be held indefinitely if a judge is convinced they are a threat. These policies, however, have been kept low-key, for fear of an anti- government backlash in public opinion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that silence on these issues during the campaign plays into the growing anti-American sentiment and may eventually hinder attempts to deal with terrorism. The best example of this is the case of Abdullah Khadr, the Canadian media's current cause celebre. Khadr is one of several Toronto-born sons of an Egyptian terrorist who was killed in a shootout with police in Pakistan. U.S. authorities suspect Abdullah of being a weapons supplier for al Qaeda and part of a group that planned to assassinate Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. On Dec. 2, he came back to Canada after 14 months in a Pakistani prison and was soon arrested on an extradition warrant, issued at the request of the United States, for conspiracy to murder Americans abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Abdullah's 19-year-old brother, Omar, has also been in the news, as the youngest person held in Guantanamo Bay, for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. Army medic in Afghanistan. The clan's mother has given interviews saying she detests Western values and that the only reason the family has returned to Canada is for the subsidized health care. One would think few families could be less popular with the liberal-minded Canadian public.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet in his current extradition battle, Abdullah is clearly winning in the court of public opinion, if not in the court of law. A number of prominent columnists and CBC News are questioning whether Canada should cooperate with the U.S. government in this or any other terrorism case.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Politicians here know that Canadians love to read, talk and debate about U.S. transgressions. Newspaper articles point to ethnic profiling at airports and long border waits as evidence that the war on terrorism is a sham, and that Americans are simply looking for excuses to harass Canadians for the country's multicultural society. But just as it chooses to ignore weaknesses in Canada's environmental policy, the public is also disinclined to take seriously the country's problems with terrorism. Those problems may not be as exaggerated as some Americans think they are  --  just recently Montana's Sen. Conrad Burns reiterated, then retracted, the popular myth that the 9/11 hijackers got into the United States through Canada  --  but they are certainly real.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The so-called millennium bomber, Ahmed Ressam, who planned to bomb Los Angeles airport on New Year's Eve 2000, did come from Canada. In another notorious case, Mohammed Zeki Mahjoub was arrested in Toronto after being accused of belonging to a militant group with ties to an Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization. Though he denied those links, Mahjoub admitted he worked closely with Osama bin Laden himself during his years in Sudan. The judge at Mahjoub's first hearing quoted from a report issued by the Canadian Security Intelligence Services that \"there are more terrorist cells operating in Canada than in any other country outside the Middle East.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worry about alienating key constituencies in a hairline election has silenced politicians here on these important issues. But Canada- U.S. relations could reach a turning point if they're not addressed. Over the past five years, Canada has stopped extraditing people to the United States if they face the death penalty. The increasing popularity of the notion that international terrorism suspects also should not be extradited have led to some serious concerns about the heavily trafficked border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just that Canada is starting to look like a safe haven for America's Most Wanted; it's that America may be starting to view Canada as a less-than-benign neighbor. U.S. Customs and Immigration this year imposed passport requirements on visiting Canadians for the first time, and there is talk of fingerprinting at the border as well. At some point, the truck traffic that carries up to 70 percent of Canadian exports south will start to bog down in security inspections. That's when Canadians' anti-American bark will really start to bite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this electoral season, the public is looking for bellicose rhetoric, but Canada's security cries out for sober management. Whoever is elected will have to work publicly with the United States, not just against it, to reduce anti-American sentiment while addressing the problem of terrorism and cross-border control. If the real need for cooperation with Canada's southern neighbor can't temper the public's demand for criticism, the nation will be in for some stormy weather in the next few years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>amorganews@hotmail.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anna Morgan is a freelance journalist and author in Canada.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1861299990.xml", "text": "<h2>Closing doors on trade isn't smart negotiating</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE TRANS-PACIFIC Partnership <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement was already politically dead by the time President Trump buried it Monday, via a formal notification that the United States would withdraw. After Mr. Trump's victory in November, Congress made no attempt to ratify the 12-nation tariff-slashing pact when President Barack Obama, the TPP's intellectual author, was still in office. Mr. Obama argued, correctly -- and consistently with post-World War II American foreign policy -- that the United States had much to gain, economically and strategically, from thickening the network of connections with friendly countries such as Japan, Australia and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China, which would have been left out of the TPP, is the immediate winner from Mr. Trump's move; it is already acting to fill the gap that Mr. Trump blithely created without offering any plausible alternative. Beijing must be doubly pleased that the same result might have occurred even if Hillary Clinton had been elected, since she backed off her previous support of the TPP in the face of a simplistic Democratic backlash led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Several Democratic senators, joined by the president of one of their party's most powerful interest groups, the AFL-CIO, hailed Mr. Trump's decision. Unfortunately, the formerly bipartisan consensus in favor of international engagement and responsibility is morphing into a bipartisan consensus against them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump now turns his attention to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, under which the flow of goods and services among the United States, Canada and Mexico has multiplied many times over since the pact took effect in 1994. Mr. Trump talks endlessly and extravagantly of jobs \"stolen\" by Mexico under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and much manufacturing work has migrated from American factories to Mexican ones. A renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which Mr. Trump claims to want, beginning with upcoming conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, is not inherently a bad idea. What relationship wouldn't benefit from a tuneup after a quarter-century? Specifically, there may be a need to revisit <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s \"domestic content\" rules to make sure products that flow tariff-free among the three countries truly originate within one of them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That assumes Mr. Trump comes to the table in good faith and with a balanced view of relevant facts. His fixation on high-profile automobile plant sitings in Mexico -- coupled with his repeated threats of a \"border tax\" on firms that exercise their rights to produce there -- does not inspire confidence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Automation, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, is the real culprit in manufacturing job loss. And while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has surely created winners and losers within the United States, overall it has not been the horrific deal Mr. Trump suggests. The combined <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and Canada was $73.4 billion in 2015 (the most recent full year for which data exist). Subtract petroleum and it shrinks to $13.9 billion, a rounding error for the $18 trillion U.S. economy. Chances are that the deficit will shrink as American oil producers crank up for exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A smart negotiator would take all that into account before risking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars that might do far more damage to American companies, workers and consumers than the status quo allegedly does.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

Congress is poised to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal (that is, move it through both houses without opportunity for amendment).\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Calling on people to \"make a ruckus,\" he pointed to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, saying that \"I still regret not doing more to strengthen\" its \"labor and environmental side-agreements\" when he was working for President Bill Clinton. \"The TPP is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on steroids.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That strong stance drew hundreds of comments, many of them pointing out that Reich supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> back in Clinton days and also a \"fast-track\" process.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Asked about this, he e-mailed: \"I pushed hard inside the Clinton administration for stronger labor and environmental side agreements to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. . . . Wish I had done more.\" And \"As to fast-tracking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, though, had no role.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ah, but some beg to differ, pointing out, among other things, a 2007 speech he gave when the Bush administration was pushing for fast-track authority, calling it \"vitally important.\" He said it was \"the only reason that any other country would sign a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaty with the United States,\" lest they sign on and Congress then changes it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to that, he quipped in an e-mail: \"Al, I don't recall what I said in Tampa in 2007. I'm lucky if I remember what I said yesterday.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kerry express</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some government jobs have really cool perks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State John Kerry, for example, has recently taken to having overseas flights make an extra stop to pick him up or drop him off. It was something Hillary Clinton also did as secretary of state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As we noted in 2010: \"Some government officials have home-to-office cars and drivers. Not many have home-to-office planes and pilots. This is at least the second time she's been dropped off in New York City on a flight to Washington. Raised some eyebrows.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most famous air commuter, of course, was former defense secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta, who flew home, sans press but with staff, from Washington to California on weekends.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometimes the detours by Kerry, who's been known to take the shuttle as well, simply mean reporters and staff on the State Department plane are left waiting briefly. (Well, nobody was promised a nonstop.) Sometimes the delays are longer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Kerry's return Saturday from Davos, Switzerland, the plane detoured to drop him off in Boston, we learned via Twitter. The plane refueled and took off to Washington after a ground delay of more than an hour. After another trip in late November, he was dropped off in New York. Again, the delay for those who stayed on board was relatively brief. Back on New Year's Day, the plane picked him up in Boston to take off to the Middle East.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there was a longer delay when he was dropped off in San Francisco on Dec. 18 - after a killer trip to the Middle East and Asia - so he could fly to his vacation house in Idaho (via a smaller government plane). It turned out staffers and reporters had to spend the night at an airport hotel - crew rest was required - and lost a day getting home, right before Christmas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>al.kamen@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The blog: washingtonpost.com/intheloop.

The two countries are the closest of friends and allies, and their economies are so tightly linked that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers with Canada could put eight million Americans out of work. And if you're the sort who worries about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits, the U.S. runs a $12.5 billion surplus with Canada in goods and services. Despite these benefits, however, the current renegotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement may result in a breakup between the two trading partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Part of the blame is owed a White House that is reflexively suspicious of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. At a small White House meeting on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> I attended, President Trump spent five minutes critiquing China before launching into a 20-minute attack on Canadian <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. It was \"Blame Canada,\" right out of \"South Park.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another problem is Americans' utter lack of interest in the Great White North. One poll showed that 92% of Americans expressed a favorable view of Canada when prompted. But Canada doesn't much impinge on American consciousness. It's what Poland was in the Alfred Jarry play \"Ubu Roi\": \"The action takes place in Poland, that is to say nowhere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The biggest obstacle to renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, however, comes from Canada -- a combination of sins of commission and of omission.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sin of commission is Canada's attempt to force political correctness into the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal by requesting new chapters on gender and indigenous groups. With the move, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau intends to signal his antagonism toward the famously politically incorrect Mr. Trump. Provoking Mr. Trump may be a popular move among Canadian voters, who have an increasingly unfavorable view of the U.S. But the distraction caused by the dispute between the two leaders could threaten the broader negotiation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rising tensions between the U.S. and Canada represent a drastically different starting point for bilateral negotiations from the climate in recent years. It used to be a tradition for newly elected American presidents to select Canada for their first diplomatic visit. It is already too late for Mr. Trump to do the same, and I would be surprised to see him visit Ottawa at any point in his remaining term. What would he gain other than public abuse?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In President Obama's last visit to Canada's House of Commons, in June 2016, members of Parliament banged their desks and shouted, \"Four More Years!\" It was a lovefest. As deliriously joyful as that was, a visit by Mr. Trump would be the opposite: a hatefest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trudeau's sins of omission present an even greater concern. The Canadian government hasn't done enough to sell the deal. It could have promoted the importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with a full-frontal campaign: meeting with editorial boards to massage the media, taking out full-page ads in major newspapers, and sponsoring conferences at which academics would discuss how many American jobs would disappear if the deal were abandoned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most important, the Canadians could have explained the need for a dispute-resolution mechanism in which a panel of experts would be empowered to rule on the tricks the two countries allege each other to have played in their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dealings. This provision is a must-have for Canadians, but they've not bothered to make the case.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those who prioritize American sovereignty -- who think that the U.S. should never subject itself to binding binational arbitration -- might think twice if they recall how we've given cause for other countries to distrust us. Consider Canada's Loewen Group, a funeral conglomerate that was taken to the cleaners in 1995 by Mississippi trial lawyers. A contract claim against Loewen that might have amounted to a few million dollars ballooned to $500 million after a jury, wrongly permitted to hear biasing evidence, awarded damages to the claimant for emotional distress. The decision was reviewed by a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-chartered panel including a member of the British House of Lords and a former chief justice of Australia, who concluded that the case had been an example of Third World justice. But in the end, the American member of the panel persuaded his peers to uphold the award on technical grounds.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now here's what's really surprising. In the midst of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation, Canada has managed to broker a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the European Union and join the Trans-Pacific Partnership. One wonders why the Trudeau government so avidly pursues <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with everyone except the U.S. Could the prime minister's ingratiating manner mask a deeper disdain for his country's greatest trading partner?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it all falls apart and the U.S. is seen as hostile to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the big winner will be China, with its eager search for new markets for its goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Buckley teaches at Scalia Law School and is author of \"The Republic of Virtue: How We Tried to Ban Corruption, Failed, and What We Can Do About It.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By F.H.

{"id": "2115071663.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA by any other name</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S aggressive and unpredictable approach to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy demands a new definition of success. Call it the \"could have been worse\" standard. His threats to pull out of existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements and slap tariffs on trading partners for spurious national security reasons portended so much disruption that he gets points for not fulfilling his protectionist potential. That's what happened in his renegotiation of the U.S.-South Korea <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, and in the deal he cut with Europe to postpone auto tariffs in return for more soybean sales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, fortunately, Mr. Trump also has retreated from the brink with respect to America's second- and third-largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. After the completion of tense last-minute talks with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Ottawa government, all three countries are now committed in principle to a replacement of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which Mr. Trump derided, wrongly, as a disaster for the United States. In its place will be a pact he calls the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, \"the most important <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal we've ever made by far.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, it is that - in the sense that it avoids a major disruption in hemispheric supply chains that would have resulted if Mr. Trump carried out his threat to dump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether. In reality, though, this bargain basically tweaks <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, by forcing, or attempting to force, more automotive production to occur in the United States rather than cheaper-labor Mexico. The means of doing this are tougher, more U.S.-friendly \"domestic content\" rules and a de facto $16-per-hour minimum wage for a large chunk of production. To get the deal with Canada, Mr. Trump agreed to retain arbitration procedures Canada wanted in return for a somewhat larger U.S. share of Canada's highly protected dairy market: 3.59 percent of it, to be exact. Though symbolically important, that victory for American dairy producers amounts to some tens of millions of dollars per year, a rounding error in the $500 billion-plus cross-border flow of goods and services.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Notably, the above measures have nothing to do with \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" but rather enshrine a norm of \"managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" reflective of the Trump team's misguided zero-sum mentality. As such, they might lead to more market-rigging mischief in later years. For now, though, this seems a price worth paying for a wider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> truce, economic stability in the Western Hemisphere - and the preservation of the essential <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> framework.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump agreed to insulate Canada and Mexico from any potential auto tariffs, the threat of which he is retaining as pressure against other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners, such as Europe and Japan. He would not lift steel and aluminum tariffs. Even in that regard, there might be a silver lining, though, because Mr. Trump announced, regarding tariffs generally, \"I'm using them to negotiate,\" which is better than preferring tariffs per se, as he has sometimes implied.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress still must scrutinize and vote on Mr. Trump's handiwork. But if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> peace can be restored among the United States and the long-standing partners with which it has relatively minor commercial disagreements, this country would be in a better position to confront the nation with which it has the most legitimate grievances, China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2062740122.xml", "text": "<h2>A Left Turn in Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico entered a brave old world on Sunday by electing former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a six-year term as president. The 64-year-old left-wing populist has lost twice, in 2006 and 2012, but this time he won against two weak candidates while promising more moderate policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official vote count wasn't available late Sunday evening, but exit polls gave Mr. Lopez Obrador a large enough margin to call him the winner. Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN) is expected to finish a distant second with Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Jose Antonio Meade in third. Early indications suggest the president-elect's coattails will make his Morena front, which includes smaller parties, the largest coalition in both legislative chambers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The campaign was marred by violence at the local level. But kudos to Mexico's National Electoral Institute, which handled 157,000 polling stations and some nine million more registered voters than in 2012. The largely peaceful vote is another milestone in Mexico's progress as a democracy since the days when Mr. Lopez Obrador worked for the PRI that ran the country as a one-party state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO, as Mr. Lopez Obrador is known, is a career politician from the oil-rich southern state of Tabasco. But in this race he ran as an outsider, pledging to end corruption, upend the establishment in politics and economics -- which he called \"mafias of power\" -- and use subsidies to lift the poor, especially in rural areas. He said he would make Mexicans better off by assigning the state a larger role in the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO has moderated his rhetoric from the decades when he railed against private investment in energy and other economic competition as Mexico shifted toward free markets. But his Morena party, which he founded in 2014, is home to many who are nostalgic for the not-so-glorious days of PRI dominance. They have never accepted the country's transition to an open economy with more political and institutional transparency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lopez Obrador's challenge will be keeping those supporters happy without derailing Mexico's economic progress under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Except for some of Mexico's crony capitalists, entrepreneurial Mexico largely opposed his candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most extreme fear is that AMLO will attempt to consolidate power a la Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. But Mexico has made considerable economic and political progress in 30 years of reform presidencies. The Mexican government doesn't hold the oil power that Chavez had, and a Mexican president is constrained by his country's obligations under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- unless President Trump tears it up. Financial markets will also vote on AMLO's government each day through foreign-exchange markets and the value of the peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. can help by completing a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal as soon as possible. Mr. Trump's anti-Mexico rhetoric played into the hands of Mr. Lopez Obrador's left-wing nationalism, but troubles in Mexico will inevitably spill across the border -- wall or no wall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AMLO's anti-corruption pledge will also be tested by how he handles the country's already weak rule of law. He has said he will amnesty drug traffickers and not investigate corrupt politicians for past crimes. His government's cooperation with the U.S. on regional drug and immigration enforcement will also be important to watch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This election has dramatically altered Mexican politics. The once-dominant PRI is now a minor party. Its losses are a repudiation of current President Enrique Pena Nieto's government. The center-right PAN is now the largest opposition party in Congress, but it too is weakened and will have to rebuild after divisive internal battles that undermined Mr. Anaya's candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some 30% of registered voters were millennials, who have no memory of the one-party state of Mr. Lopez Obrador's youth. They are dissatisfied with Mexico's status quo and have voted for a change. Let's hope the change they get isn't back to the future of state economic control and peso devaluation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "2226641523.xml", "text": "<h2>A united front on China?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S repeated tariff skirmishes with U.S. trading partners have forced us to adopt a new definition of progress on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Rather than actual advancement toward open and equitable access to global markets, for the United States and for all countries, progress now means avoiding retreat from that goal. By that heavily discounted measure, there was progress on two fronts this week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday,</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump agreed to drop the steel and aluminum tariffs he had levied against Canada and Mexico on spurious national security grounds. In return, he received an end to those two neighbors' retaliatory tariffs and a pledge from them to do more to prevent the transshipment of metals from China, whose subsidized overproduction is at the root of the international metals industries' woes. Ending these tariffs removes what politicians in all three countries, including key Republicans in the Senate, had branded an obstacle to ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Mr. Trump's replacement for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, the USMCA epitomizes our discounted definition of progress, because it actually diminishes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the crucial automotive sector (while adding some modest, and necessary, updates to the current North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement). Mr. Trump's threatened alternative, however - a U.S. renunciation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and a breakdown in hemispheric commerce - would be worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump postponed for six months a decision on whether to hit foreign automakers with new tariffs. The alternative was to impose them pursuant to a review process that the president ordered last year, which found auto imports, most of which come from Germany and Japan, to be a threat to national security, despite the fact that many U.S. consumers like Audis, Mazdas and the rest, and that those two countries have mutual defense treaties with the United States. With passenger vehicles imports worth $191.7 billion last year, and an additional $158.8 million of vehicle parts potentially affected (directly or indirectly), the threatened tariffs faced tremendous resistance from both U.S. automakers and those abroad, who understand the fragility of carefully constructed international supply chains. This has apparently stayed Mr. Trump's hand, pending further talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reduced tensions with trading partners in Europe, Asia and the Western hemisphere  let the Trump administration focus its attention on negotiations with China, where it has the strongest argument for playing hardball. It is even possible that traditional U.S. friends, who have their own disagreements with Chinese mercantilism, might rally to Mr. Trump's side in that contest, even at this late date and despite the gratuitous fights he has picked with them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A united front against China is the strategy Mr. Trump should have pursued from the beginning, and it's far from a sure thing he can organize an effective collective effort now.

In his effort to extract concessions from Mexico on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, President Trump has failed to understand his opponent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It isn't quite right to say that negotiations were scheduled to begin this week, with Mr. Trump hosting Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto in Washington. Mr. Trump has been negotiating since last year's campaign. His strategy has been to soften up the opponent with verbal abuse and extreme threats, including the possibility of tearing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The president-elect has done a wonderful job of preconditioning other countries [with] whom we will be negotiating that change is coming,\" Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross gloated during his Senate confirmation hearing. \"The peso didn't go down 35% by accident. Even the Canadian dollar has gotten somewhat weaker -- also not an accident. He has done some of the work that we need to do in order to get better <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having witnessed his nation and its currency pummeled in the public square, the Mexican president was supposed to crawl to Washington and agree to whatever terms his U.S. counterpart put on the table. Maybe Mr. Trump should have Googled the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexicans are still smarting over that one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Mr. Trump told Mexico that a promise to pay for a border wall was a prerequisite for the scheduled meeting, Mr. Pena Nieto canceled. The White House responded by saying it would extract the money for the wall with a 20% tariff on Mexican exports to the U.S. Of course American consumers would be the ones paying. But in any case it would be the end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have to hope their new president is not that reckless. Even the Soviets recognized that mutually assured destruction was a bad idea. A phone call between the two heads of state on Friday ended with both sides agreeing to future discussions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> cannot be dissolved without inflicting great harm on the country that Mr. Trump has sworn to protect. Mexico is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner, and some six million American jobs rely on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the southern neighbor. According to the Agriculture Department, \"sales of food and farm products to Mexico totaled a record $19.5 billion in fiscal year 2014.\" That was 13% of U.S. agricultural exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump says that the U.S. has been outfoxed in manufacturing because American companies now make things in Mexico. But imports from Mexico contain significant American content, and production-sharing across the continent has given U.S. companies an edge in the global market. New tariffs on Mexican imports would damage that competitiveness and may result in retaliatory Mexican tariffs on U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Legal experts say it isn't clear how much unilateral power Mr. Trump has to maneuver. Article 2205 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> allows the president to withdraw from the agreement. But it is being debated whether that would repeal the congressional legislation that put it into effect. If so, tariffs would revert to pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> levels, which implies using the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization tariff schedule. American exporters to Mexico would face greater tariff hikes than Mexican exporters to the U.S., because Mexico accepted much greater tariff reductions under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> than the U.S. did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Jan. 10 paper from the international law firm White & Case says that its reading of the agreement and U.S. law \"implies that substantive modifications of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> outside of tariffs and rules of origin would require congressional authorization.\" The rules of origin -- the share of a product that must be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-sourced -- have changed several times already, and Mexico might agree to alter them again. But it has said that it won't budge on tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump might try to invoke the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977 to slap his oft-promised punitive tariff on Mexican imports. But it is hard to argue that national security is being threatened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 45th president has said he wants to craft new bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Mexico says it is not interested. It has learned a hard lesson about relying on an unreliable partner, and its aim now is to diversify its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> portfolio. Policy makers are said to be exploring new agreements in the region with countries eager to replace U.S. agricultural suppliers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's demagoguery has offended Mexican pride. But it has also destabilized an economy that was already buffeted by low oil prices. As the rector of ITAM, one of the most prestigious universities in Latin America, said earlier this month, \"It would be, perhaps, preferable to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> aside rather than a long process of negotiation and tension.\" Mexicans can bargain too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "421385887.xml", "text": "<h2>The World; MEXICO; A Tale of Two Economies, One Flourishing, the Other Moribund</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican economy is rapidly growing, but few Mexicans are benefiting. There are two economies in Mexico: a strong, industrial, exporting sector and a weak, inefficient, domestic-oriented sector still suffering from the government's decision, in 1985, to liberalize import restrictions. Indeed, all that is well in the Mexican economy is related to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The boom in the Mexican economy is a novelty for Mexicans under age 18, half the population: They have never experienced anything like it. Fundamentally, surging economic growth means something else as well: For the first time in more than 30 years, the Mexican economy has a sound foundation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ever since the '60s, the economy had been floundering. In the '70s, the chief cause was government expropriation of companies it deemed to be \"strategic.\" The Echeverria and Lopez Portillo administrations, in effect, built a fictitious economy, one totally dependent upon government favors and regulations. Since then, excessive government borrowing and sheer incompetence have checked economic growth. The economy barely succeeded in not further diminishing the welfare of the average Mexican.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The recent economic recovery, with a growth rate above 7% this year, showcases the new strength of such restructured industries as automobiles, auto parts, steel, cement, chemicals, fertilizers, electronics and pharmaceuticals. This modernized side of the economy, however, employs less than one-third of all working Mexicans. The companies, both Mexican and foreign, pay extraordinary wages relative to those received by most Mexicans; their productivity rates rival those anywhere in the world, and they demand ever higher levels of training and education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The remainder of Mexican workers struggle to make ends meet. Most of the businesses, usually small and medium-sized low-tech manufacturers, that employ them have failed to adjust to the new economic circumstances. Unable to compete with U.S. or Asian imports, they rely more and more on a shrinking domestic market. But they still employ around 60% of the industrial work force.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two things happened when the economy crashed in 1995, following the devaluation of the peso. On the one hand, the government, which avoided bankruptcy only because of the U.S. bailout, addressed the country's economic problems head-on and succeeded in restabilizing the economy, as a whole, in short order. Even so, there were casualties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The older part of the economy, having lost its protection from imports and facing ever more import competition as a result of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, was hanging on largely because of old supplier relationships. Many of these businesses continued to sell to each other, regardless of quality, in those sectors not immediately affected by imports. For example, manufacturers of radios collapsed overnight, but pencil and food producers, though their markets were shrinking, stayed afloat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The crash of 1995 delivered the coup de grace to these businesses. They couldn't service old debts, which kept growing. In a matter of days, interest rates skyrocketed from around 17% to more than 160%. Having failed to develop export relationships, they could not capitalize on export opportunities then available. Finally, the economic depression dried up their domestic markets. The older economy became moribund.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other effect of the '95 crash was that the government had no choice but to adopt a series of policies that greatly diminished its ability to make independent decisions. First, it changed its exchange-rate policy: The government would no longer fix the peso's exchange rate, but let its currency float. That policy recently passed a tough test. While Asian currencies were falling, throwing their economies into crisis, the peso, though it drifted downward, did not precipitate a similar reaction in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The government's attempts to save the Mexican banking system from bankruptcy were less successful. Three years after the crash, the banks still cannot fulfill their primary purpose: to fuel the growth of the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bottom line is that the Mexican economy is growing despite itself. Domestic economic and political institutions are weak. The political parties do not exert leadership. The banks do not provide credit. The police does not reduce crime. The judiciary does not settle disputes. Only a handful of institutions serve their purpose. The new Federal Electoral Institute, for one, has shown that elections need not be stolen and that they can be credible. In the economy, it is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that has become the key institution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is only an agreement to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> goods and establish rules of investment. But from the Mexican side, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is much more. The reason why the Salinas administration first proposed to negotiate an economic agreement with the United States was essentially political. Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wanted to anchor the reforms he had set in motion to something that would make them permanent. Given the personalistic and un-institutionalized nature of Mexican politics, nothing inside Mexico could accomplish this. Only the United States could offer such a guaranty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The unfolding of history since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was inaugurated, early in 1994, has confirmed, over and over, the wisdom of both governments in fighting for such an arrangement. Both nations have benefited greatly, even though many unskilled American and Mexican workers have lost out. One measure of success, the easy one, can be found in the sheer volume of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the two nations. Total bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will exceed $180 billion this year. It was less than $35 billion in 1987.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much more important than the numbers is that the Mexican economy has stuck to the course outlined in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, despite the temptation that, when the crash struck in 1995, many people and politicians in Mexico, if not most, would have willingly changed course and taken Mexico back into the economic and political doldrums of a protected economy and an authoritarian political system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Mexican economy still has a long way to go. In stark contrast with most Asian nations, and fortunately for its stability, the banks in Mexico have played no part in the making of the current economic boom. But without a working, efficient and competitive banking system, the reach of the economy's growth will continue to be limited, and most Mexicans will remain left out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (No Caption), CATHERINE PARR / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Luis Rubio is director of the Center of Research for Development</p>\n"}

The differences between North and South, Europe and America, East and West seem intractable. But that doesn't mean we should give up on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. A look at the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> success stories of the 1990s suggests a formula for further progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The past decade has seen a host of highly productive but often little publicized regional and sectoral arrangements that have helped expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. If the WTO falters, political leaders should look to a more targeted agenda, which would face fewer obstacles and could set the stage for later global agreement by resolving current issues and providing evidence of the economic and political value of opening markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The barriers to a successful WTO negotiation are legion -- and they extend beyond unruly street demonstrations. Differences between member states over genetically engineered foods, textiles, agriculture, investment and antidumping rules are not easily resolved. Cultural issues like access to video markets are only complicated by the Internet. And U.S. insistence on linking labor rights and environmental stewardship to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is seen as veiled protectionism by many developing countries. Facilitating WTO entry by China and the former Soviet bloc countries is proving time-consuming and politically difficult. With 134 countries struggling to accommodate the comprehensive agenda they have set for themselves, it is unrealistic to expect the WTO's next round to wind up its work any faster than the nearly 13 years required to finish the Uruguay Round.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By contrast, consider the record of accomplishment in building regional and sectoral free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Three major regional groupings (Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific) have blossomed in the past decade with impressive records of stimulating economies and overcoming traditional political divisions. Subregional arrangements have also flourished -- in the southern cone of South America, in the Andean region, in non-EU Europe and in Southeast Asia. The North American and Asia-Pacific agreements have also spurred Europe to cultivate closer ties with Mexico, South America and East Asia. Politically inspired <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements such as the U.S.-Israel free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement and the nascent U.S. initiatives with Africa and the Caribbean may also overcome the protectionist undercurrents that complicate broader <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the problems bedeviling global negotiations are less troublesome in regional settings. Friction over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in cultural services and genetically engineered products, which has a protectionist undertone, is clearly less pronounced within the Asia-Pacific and American regions than between Europe and the U.S. Europe is more willing to reach accommodation on divisive issues such as steel and agriculture with prospective EU members like Poland and Hungary than with the U.S. or Brazil.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, sectoral agreements on financial services, information technology and telecommunications have helped expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> measurably since the early 1990s. All three agreements were fueled by the efforts of the international business community. Their success demonstrates the ability of pragmatic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> officials to reach accommodation on a narrow agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Officials in the U.S. and other countries should build on the success of regional and sectoral agreements to craft a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-liberalization strategy.

At the same time, we are reaching out to our Caribbean neighbors to seek the establishment of a partnership for prosperity. This movement toward regional integration has been invigorated by the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A hemispheric free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area, as envisioned by President Bush, has captured the imagination of the region's leaders and entrepreneurs, galvanizing efforts to take the necessary steps to fulfill this shared vision. The inclusion of Mexico in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be a major step in cementing the initiative. Our nations look forward to the opportunities presented by Mexico's participation in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment growth that its expansion could well bring to our region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ten years ago, the U.S. developed the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) to stimulate economic growth and social development through <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment. Expanded access to the U.S. market has enabled us to increase our nontraditional exports and improve our international competitiveness. Since the CBI program began, the region has attracted approximately $1.5 billion in new investment. However, it is hoped that expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to include Mexico will stimulate additional investment, allowing us to build on the progress that we have made.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, to accomplish this it is first necessary to ensure that the expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> does not put the CBI countries at a comparative disadvantage with Mexico in attracting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment. Consequently, as the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations proceed, a bridging mechanism for the CBI countries should be developed. Such a mechanism would solidify the reforms carried out thus far and strengthen the positive economic and political trends taking place in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To heighten awareness of the region's concerns, our countries have been engaged in a series of consultations, resulting in the First Ministerial Conference for Central America and the Caribbean, hosted by Honduras this weekend. This conference brings together for the first time the foreign-affairs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ministers of all countries in our area. The conference will address these issues, strengthen our growing ties and set forth an agenda for future cooperation. The participants will try to identify appropriate mechanisms to ensure equal access to the U.S. market and allow us a level playing field in competing with Mexican producers and in attracting foreign capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In particular, access to the U.S. market for nontraditional exports and for products not included under the CBI (e.g., sugar, footwear, leather goods) would generate substantial export earnings, strengthening economic growth in our countries and creating export markets for American companies and jobs for American workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Through EAI and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. has an historic opportunity to consolidate the vision of a prosperous, stable and democratic hemisphere. Open markets for goods, services and investment are the basis of this vision. Honduras, together with our sister nations in Central America and the Caribbean, stands ready to meet this challenge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Callejas was elected president of Honduras in November 1989.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2150283295.xml", "text": "<h2>Fix one trade uncertainty</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE TRADE truce this past weekend between the United States and China gave U.S. business a dose of confidence - which President Trump undid Tuesday with a series of Twitter messages suggesting he is still \"a tariff man\" whose patience with Beijing is growing short. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen almost 300 points on Monday, dropped almost 800 points on Tuesday. Mr. Trump then sent upbeat signals Wednesday (when the markets were closed for a day of mourning in honor of former president George H.W. Bush). The upshot is that uncertainty about U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy continues to plague an otherwise robust economy, and that much of it has been created by the president himself, first by launching various <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars, then by conducting them erratically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ironically, the best way for Congress, soon to be divided between a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, to help would be to give Mr. Trump something he wants: approval of the modified <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement he has negotiated with Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal exists because Mr. Trump exaggeratedly blamed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for industrial job losses and pledged to either renegotiate or end it. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> needed a refresh after a quarter-century in force: new rules on digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and a ban on localized data-storage requirements in the three member nations. Those are in Mr. Trump's proposed deals, along with useful changes (more U.S. access to Canada's protected dairy market) and possibly counterproductive ones (stricter rules on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-origin inputs for auto manufacturers and, for Mexico, a $16-an-hour minimum wage for certain auto workers).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the whole, however, the new bargain represents a tweak of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that, if enacted, would stabilize a hemispheric <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area that Mr. Trump had threatened to destabilize. Mr. Trump's team expects eventual approval because many changes it negotiated - especially the auto-industry rules - were on the wish list of the Democrats and their allies in organized labor. But the temptation for the likely next speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), would be to turn the deal down and thus deny Mr. Trump a victory. On Friday, she said the deal still lacks \"enough enforcement reassurances\" regarding her party's priority issues. Meanwhile, Senate Republican supporters of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> object to the deal's attempt to manage <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in autos. Mr. Trump pressured Congress by threatening to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which, if he follows through, could present lawmakers with a choice between accepting his deal and a potentially disastrous return to the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> status quo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The politics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been scrambled by the simultaneous rise of a protectionist Republican president and a shift in the Democratic Party's base from unionized industrial areas to suburbs. The hope is that there may be enough strange political bedfellows to create a bipartisan majority in each chamber of Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Prompt ratification of this less-than-optimal deal, fleshed out, if need be, with language in the implementing statutes to address Ms. Pelosi's concerns, would stabilize the hemispheric economy, enabling the United States and its allies to focus efforts on the country Mr. Trump has properly, if hyperbolically, identified as a genuine obstacle to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2226672233.xml", "text": "<h2>A Metals Tariff Reprieve</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> policy is never a straight line with the Trump Administration, and Friday's agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada to lift steel and aluminum tariffs is a good example of two steps forward and one step back.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good news is that the countries agreed to lift the tit-for-tat tariffs that the U.S. imposed last year on the dubious grounds that steel and aluminum from our close northern ally is a threat to national security. Canada and Mexico in turn will lift their retaliatory tariffs that have been hurting the U.S. Farm Belt, among other American exporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This will provide more metal for U.S. manufacturers that have been struggling under price increases and supply crunches in many products. It will also provide more competition for U.S. steel makers that have been profiting from this government favoritism at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement removes a major obstacle to consideration of President Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that would replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Republican Senators had made lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs a condition of even considering support for the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal, as Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley explained on our pages last month.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal is still a long way from having the votes to pass, and Democrats want to rewrite the labor and drug-patent provisions, but at least the pact won't fail because of Trump Administration steel-tariff suicide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The step backward is that Friday's tariff-lifting deal allows the U.S. to re-impose the tariffs if either aluminum or steel imports \"surge meaningfully beyond historic volumes of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> over a period of time, with consideration of market share, \" according to the joint U.S.-Canada statement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is a U.S. warning to Canada in particular to restrain its exports, since the word \"meaningfully\" is likely to be defined by the U.S. steel and aluminum industries. They'll complain to the White House at the first sign of price and supply competition and call it a \"surge.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the very least this provision means there will continue to be uncertainty in steel and aluminum <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows and supply chains, which will hang over Canadian exporters and American consumers. At worst it could lead to de- facto quotas on steel and aluminum imports, which means politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The Canadians are taking a risk in agreeing to this provision, but they must believe that lifting the tariffs and aiding the prospects for ratification of new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> were worth it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lifting the tariffs offers some relief to the harm that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy has done to the North American economy. Mr. Trump also agreed Friday to postpone a decision on tariffs on European cars for 180 days pending negotiations with Europe. Both moves are welcome in particular given that U.S.-China <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks have broken down and may take weeks or even months to strike a deal, if one is still possible before the 2020 election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> policy is the Trump Administration's version of regulation in the Obama years -- a political risk that never really goes away.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "399027334.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexican Watershed</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexicans head to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president, and the choice they face is notably stark: Accelerate the pace of modernization that began in the mid-1980s or, because progress has been achieved a little slowly, revert to the economically populist and insular ways of old Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While there are five candidates in the race, polls indicate the presidency will go either to Felipe Calderon of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who represents the first alternative, or Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the far-left Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), who represents the second. The two are running in a statistical dead heat, some eight to 10 percentage points ahead of third-place candidate Roberto Madrazo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anything can still happen in a three-man contest, but the decline of the PRI candidate is remarkable given that that leftist party dominated Mexico from 1929 to 2000. But Mexico began to change some 20 years ago, chipping away at one-party rule and opening to the world. On the economic front, thousands of government-owned businesses were privatized and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tariffs began to come down. Thirteen years ago Mexico signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Six years ago it held free elections for president and unseated the PRI. Amazingly, that transfer of power was not accompanied by an economic meltdown, the usual Mexican pattern.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is progress. But for many Mexicans the transition has been too slow. Over-regulation of business still damps animal spirits. Key parts of the economy -- telecom, oil, natural gas, electricity, cement and transportation, among others -- remain de facto monopolies, damaging productivity growth, job creation and Mexican competitiveness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lopez Obrador has used this underperformance to tap into nostalgia for old Mexico, with its closed, centrally planned economy. He wants to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He rejects the opening of Mexico's corn and bean markets to U.S. exports, now slated for 2008. He promises Mexicans an FDR-style New Deal that would include a massive public works program and a government-subsidized blitz to build one million homes for the poor. Critics also fear an authoritarian streak, based on his track record as a Mexico City mayor who defied judicial rulings and had a penchant for calling out the mob.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Left-wing populists are hardly new in Latin America, of course. In the worst case, they become more authoritarian and statist in power, like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Others discover they can't govern this way and turn pragmatic, as with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva. Mr. Lopez Obrador has fallen in the polls as his opponents have compared him to Mr. Chavez, and he has rejected any connection. A Lopez Obrador victory would nonetheless be a stern test of how committed Mexico is to joining the global march toward freer economic and political development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Calderon -- energy minister before winning the PAN nomination -- offers a very different program. He promises to simplify the tax regime, allow private \"partnerships\" for deep water oil exploration, and rid the country of monopoly privilege. He's also committed to preserving fiscal and monetary stability, the one area where current President Vicente Fox's administration has done well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Calderon draws most of his support from the northern half of Mexico -- traditional PAN strongholds and prime beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- as shown in the nearby map of areas where each candidate is leading in the polls. He also does well with the Mexican middle class, which is finally getting on its feet after three decades of profligate government spending, corruption and the devastating currency devaluations of 1976, 1982 and 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A stable peso has since led to low inflation, and interest rates have followed. In recent years markets for consumer credit and mortgages have developed. Retail competition has given Mexican consumers a taste of what is possible. Still, the benefits have flowed slowly and unevenly, and Mr. Lopez Obrador continues to draw support from the leftist intelligentsia, government bureaucrats and the country's impoverished south.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Americans, the stakes in this election could hardly be greater. Tom Tancredo and friends may believe that the only thought the U.S. need give its southern neighbor is the height of the wall it plans to raise between them. But if Mexicans are able to build on the liberalizing trends of the past 20 years, their appetite for El Norte is bound, over time, to diminish. And if they revert to the populist habits of yore, no American wall will be high enough to keep the flood of desperate workers out.</p>\n"}

American dairy companies employ nearly a million people, generating direct wages of $39 billion and an overall economic footprint of more than $206 billion, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico is America's single largest export dairy market, with $1.2 billion in sales last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Dairy Export Council estimates that the U.S. provides close to 75% of Mexico's dairy products, which supports nearly 30,000 American jobs. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is working well for both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dairy exports to Canada, on the other hand, face extremely high tariffs. Moreover, in February Canada implemented a state-controlled pricing policy that pays Canadian dairy farmers more than 50% more for their milk, which drives dairy prices higher in Canada than in the U.S. Simultaneously, Canada undermines global markets for dairy proteins by exporting skim-milk powder far below the global price. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations present an opportunity to stop these unfair practices, and we applaud the Trump administration's commitment to this. Most of Canadian agriculture has already embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with great success.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But fixing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't enough to keep the American dairy industry globally competitive. The most significant opportunity for dairy farmers and product manufacturers is to expand international markets, but as the U.S. focuses on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, other countries are aggressively forging new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. These arrangements, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, are providing America's competitors with preferential access to a growing middle class. The Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement, finalized earlier this month, is a perfect example.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Europe is one of America's primary dairy competitors. Now it is using its free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to enshrine nontariff standards such as prohibitions on the use of generic food terms such as \"parmesan\" or \"romano.\" These standards block competitors from entering those markets. The EU has completed other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Canada and Vietnam, and it is negotiating with Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand are quickly expanding their global reach, announcing that they will launch free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations with the Pacific Alliance of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The agreement among the remaining nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to move forward without the U.S. is only the latest in a growing string of setbacks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's absence has essentially converted slow and overly cautious countries into the most urgent deal makers of modern times. In contrast to the Trump administration's sentiments, expressed during its recent Asia trip, the U.S. ought to re-engage proactively -- and do so quickly.

This country has the most sustainable and competitive agricultural system in the world, an enduring and natural advantage.

Oil prices fell, Mexico went into a severe downturn, banks were nationalized. But Villar stayed north of the border, running Los Angeles' California Commerce Bank as a Banamex subsidiary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He nurtured the small bank's business, handling cross-border transactions for U.S. companies and developing electronic transfer systems for the money that immigrants sent home to families in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came powerful changes in the 1990s. Mexico joined the worldwide General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> (GATT), signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) and suffered a wrenching devaluation of the peso in early 1995.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And California Commerce Bank's business took off. Its assets have grown 50% to $1.2 billion in the last three years as Southern California companies found increasing opportunities to do business with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this region's companies didn't find opportunity in the automobile and other big businesses directly connected to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement. Rather, they found opportunities in services such as finance, food and energy distribution and real estate development, because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the aftermath of Mexico's devaluation changed the environment on both sides of the border. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> allowed companies to have a long-term outlook about business in Mexico,\" says Villar.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, Smart & Final Inc., a client of Cal Commerce among other banks, brought its innovation of bulk distribution of food and cleaning products for restaurants to Mexico in a joint venture with that country's largest food store chain. There were great opportunities for the Vernon-based operator of warehouse stores to improve distribution and cut costs for Mexican small businesses. And so Smart & Final succeeded. It now has five stores in Mexico and will open another in six weeks, in Tijuana.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cal Commerce Bank also was able to come up with complex sale/lease-back arrangements involving two legal systems, languages and currencies that have enabled developers in Mexico to build condominium units for Southern California clients of the bank to buy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, innovative financing for Mexican development has become a Southern California specialty, in deals well beyond the capacity of tiny Cal Commerce. Developers in Mexico are building factories and housing units at a record pace because \"financing is based on the credit rating of the foreign company using the premises, not on Mexican land values or the credit of the Mexican developer,\" explains Dennis Hearst of Cushman Realty's San Diego office. Hearst sees a lot of Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese companies as well as U.S. firms stepping up activities in the Mexican border region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Southern California utilities are expanding natural gas distribution in Mexico. Enova Corp. of San Diego, in partnership with Los Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises, with which it is scheduled to merge this year, is investing $75 million to build gas distribution services in Mexicali and the state of Chihuahua.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pacific Enterprises is seeking to build similar systems throughout South America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it is in financial services that the growing and varied connections between Southern California and Mexico are clearest. Money transfer, for example, is a big business. Wells Fargo Bank has a service called InterCuenta Express that transfers money directly to automated teller machines at Banamex branches all over Mexico. Depositors put dollars in Wells accounts here and pesos are available to recipients at Banamex branches.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. Postal Service is also in the money transfer business through a partnership with Mexico's Bancomer. The volumes involved are sizable; the governor of Guanajuato state in central Mexico, from which many have emigrated, estimates that $700 million a year comes in through remittances from immigrants to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit is a major need in Mexico, where banks typically make only short-term loans, at 30% interest, to small businesses. Seeing opportunity, Antonino Morales, a onetime executive at Security Pacific bank, is setting up operations throughout Mexico for the Commercial Credit division of Travelers Group. Morales is basing his operation in San Diego.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And Bastion Capital, the Los Angeles-based venture capital company led by Daniel Villanueva, is backing cosmetics companies and other start-ups in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People coming to Southern California from Latin America also need credit. So Villar's Cal Commerce bank has a credit card for people without credit history in the United States. \"Initially, the card must be backed by cash in a savings account, but over six months we begin to extend credit on the card,\" explains Villar, 47, a lifelong employee of Banamex, whose father also worked for the bank. Interest on Cal Commerce's cards ranges from 12% to 17%, similar to most credit cards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point is that the opportunities in Mexico and Latin America are in services--sophisticated ways to lend money, reach customers and distribute goods. And those are just the kind of businesses that Southern California companies excel in. Services are our comparative advantage in less-developed economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hard work and perseverance are necessary, of course. \"Cal Commerce bank is very well placed now, Salvador {Villar} has a unique ability to tailor services for his customers,\" says Villanueva of Bastion, a friend of Villar's.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"And he deserves it,\" Villanueva goes on. \"He hung in there through some pretty bleak times and has seen business improve.\" Like Villar and his bank, Southern California and Mexico, too, have seen bleak times--and now, finally--business improving.</p>\n"}

Times editorial writer Marjorie Miller asked experts on both sides of the 2,000-mile border to discuss issues likely to come up on the two-day visit. Here are their edited responses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor of Rosarito, Mexico, and owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I wish the Obama administration would recognize the effort we are making to clean up our cities, our police forces, our state and country. Certain elements in the U.S. government have reacted very quickly in telling people not to come to Mexico, talking only about the problems we have and that we have a lot of narcos. We do, but you have more over there. Our criminals sell the drugs wholesale, you distribute them retail, and the amount of money handled by U.S. distributors is probably 10 times as much.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Hugo Torres Chabert</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For our city in particular, the travel warning is a big problem. We have had lots of killings. But 96% of the killings in our area were between traffickers. That also happens in New Orleans and Baltimore and other cities with high crime rates. But all of a sudden, there is a campaign to stay away from Mexico. We haven't had any tourist or visitor caught in a crossfire in 20 years. We have 20 million visitors a year in Baja California, so really the risk is not there for a tourist. Yet in Rosarito, we have lost about 70% of tourists since the middle of last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>John Cook</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor of El Paso</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I hope there is very candid discussion about what's fueling the money and arms for the drug wars. One thing we need is some kind of commitment from the U.S. as to how we're going to inspect southbound traffic. Currently we don't have that. Thousands of trucks a day travel from Juarez into El Paso and then make the trip back. This causes congestion on Interstate 10, and that's without stopping every vehicle for an inspection. If we were to start inspecting them, we would have traffic congestion for miles down the freeway at rush hour. One solution would be to use gamma ray technology, which we are using on northbound traffic. We run all of these big trucks through the gamma ray, and we can see what kind of cargo they have; we can see concealed compartments in the trailers and if there's a pallet of money or a pallet of weapons. The money we would end up confiscating could be used to make improvements to the ports of entry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A second issue Mexico and the United States need to talk about is commerce. The lack of demand for consumer products on this side has had a significant impact on the economy of places like Juarez and Chihuahua. For example, Electrolux had 3,000 employees in Mexico. But as the demand for refrigerators drops on this side, they lay people off on their side, and we've seen high unemployment on the other side of the border. That's meant a decline in shopping and tourism from the south to the north. Our revenues for El Paso will be $9 million short of what they were projected to be. That's because the Mexican shoppers are not coming over here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jose Reyes Ferriz</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we saw from the previous administration was the building of a wall, trying to isolate the United States from Mexico to keep the problems outside. That doesn't work. There must be a recognition by both governments that we are facing joint problems and that the only way we'll be able to solve those problems is working together to bring about a solution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem right now is organized crime. The major problem we have is the sale of guns in the United States without regard to the fact that those guns are going to be illegally smuggled into Mexico. This needs to be investigated by the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second point that needs to be addressed is money. The activities by organized crime in Mexico are financed with drug money coming in from the United States. Money-laundering investigations need to be stepped up so the flow of money into those illegal activities stops. And when organized crime goes unchecked, it ventures into new areas. We have seen some organized crime getting into the trafficking of persons, helping illegals go into the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wayne Cornelius</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Director, Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, UC San Diego</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's very clear that the Obama administration is not going to get to comprehensive immigration reform this year. There are simply too many distractions. So if you're not going to do immigration reform, what do you do? You suggest that you are responsive to the drug violence and respond to very strong criticism from the Hispanic Caucus and the pro-immigration lobby's criticism of the work-site raids that have taken place in recent years. What they're saying, and I agree strongly, is that conducting raids affects mostly migrant workers themselves; it does not create a systematic deterrent to employers. It would be better to do more workplace audits, to ramp up the enforcement of the existing employer-sanctions law, rather than do these pinprick raids. You audit the hiring records and make sure the Social Security numbers on those forms coincide with what's in the federal database.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I would focus on cooperative development alternatives to migration. We need to get a start on that, and even though there isn't a huge constituency for that approach in Congress, it's something that Mexico would take as a very constructive sign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is an approach whose time has come. It's going to require cooperation with Mexico and the international organizations that operate in rural Mexico. It's certainly more cost-effective than what we're doing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raymundo Riva Palacio</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Editor of the online newspaper Eje Central</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexicans object to our country being called a \"failed state.\" It touches our nationalistic nerve. Nevertheless, we do have a failed state. There are more than 100 municipalities controlled by the drug cartels. In some cities, like in Tamaulipas, the cartels provide protection, control prostitution, charge drug taxes. There are a number of mayors working with them, and dozens of local policemen on their payroll.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that it is very easy to get away with criminal activity in Mexico. There's no real incentive to follow the rule of law, and there are a lot incentives not to. The costs for criminal activity are still too low. The U.S. can apply political pressure, but this is basically a Mexican problem we have to solve internally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People in Mexico love President Obama, even if he doesn't know anything about Mexico. He's never been in Mexico, even as a tourist. We also like Hillary, but she doesn't really understand either. Mexico is going to be disappointed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Obama says he is going to propose immigration reform, we think it's going to be the whole enchilada. Since the Democratic convention, however, we have known that what they are talking about is giving a very limited number of permanent residents amnesty. Those who want to apply have to prove how long they were there, pay taxes and penalties, go back to the source country and apply there. But we are thinking of a general amnesty for Mexicans, which is never going to happen. So whatever happens will be a disappointment.--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shannon K. O'Neil</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Douglas Dillon fellow for Latin America studies, Council on Foreign Relations</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are Mexico's largest export market; 80% to 85% of their exports go to the United States. They're the second-largest consumer of our exports after Canada. Some estimates say that 2 million U.S. jobs depend on exports to Mexico. So, how their economy fares affects jobs here in the United States. Obviously we need to figure out how to stimulate our own economy, but we should also be thinking about our closest neighbor not only for their stability but because our economy depends on them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We've seen some rough patches in the last couple of weeks with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and the end of funding for a pilot program allowing certified Mexican truckers to come to the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, part of our obligation was to open up the trucking system to Mexican truckers. We've dragged our feet for several years and now just shut down that program, and that's led to retaliation on the Mexican side. I would like to see us come together and find a way to move forward.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feeling is that it would be very difficult for any of the governments to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But there are things you can do on a bilateral basis that could be negotiated. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> focused solely on goods and not on the movement of people, which often follows from the movement of goods. We have side agreements on labor, but you could really strengthen them so they have real teeth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obviously we don't have a lot of money for foreign assistance. But there are ways we can be smart about economic development in Mexico. This is the root of a lot of tensions in our relationship, be it migration, the drug <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, other illegal industries, and a lot of those in part come from the lack other legal economic opportunities in Mexico. The fact that there aren't formal jobs means people migrate to find formal jobs, often in illicit economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: GOING SOUTH: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit begins today.; PHOTOGRAPHER:J.

I\u2019m not convinced.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>OAXACA, MEXICO</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have quite a lot of sympathy for certain Trump voters, and (wait, please, let me finish) I've been making a list of some concerns that Donald Trump the candidate (I beg you to stop interrupting me \u2014 this won't take long) raised when he was on the campaign trail and in the White House. If the Democrats (thank you, I appreciate your patience) ignore these subjects, they risk losing next week and in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president got my attention in September when the subject of new tariffs on China arose \u2014 tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. Certain Apple products that might have been affected were ultimately excluded after the company objected. Still, Trump had told Apple, with a characteristic snarl on Twitter, \"Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apple obviously would regard the demand as a punitive one, likely to reduce the profits of a trillion-dollar company that depends on the sweat of poorly paid Chinese labor and the connivance of Chinese commissars whose oppressive policies are well-known and widely publicized. Yet Trump's point is a fair one: Why not make Apple products here? Anyone driving the side roads of America sees towns put out of work because manufacturing went elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's winning pitches as a candidate called attention to these towns, and he was cheered as he gave speeches in them, promising to revitalize them by renegotiating the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Having just spent two years traveling in Mexico, I agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was deeply flawed, though not in ways that Trump cares about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies that moved their manufacturing to Mexico are prospering, but their workers there barely make ends meet. The exploitation of labor in the maquiladoras in border towns is a disgrace \u2014 the visible obscenity of American factories a few hundred yards over the border at, say, Mexicali or Ciudad Juarez or Reynosa, merely to allow these companies to pay workers $8.50 a day, making everything from airplane components to automobile seat belts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's recent renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>won't do much to change things, which makes it all the more important for Democratic candidates to understand the deal's inequities, the fundamental one being that it put American workers out of jobs while exploiting Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration policy is flawed too, and the subject of migration misunderstood. No, the answer is not building the Murus Hadrianus Trumpus at the border, but the problem is far greater than the stereotype of Mexicans swimming across the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, Mexican immigration has plunged in recent years, but there has been a surge in undocumented migrants from Central America, as with the thousands of Hondurans making their way north through Mexico en masse toward the United States over the past several days. Add to these unfortunates the many so-called special-interest aliens</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>, Chinese who pay a small fortune to sneak through tunnels into California, or the undocumented Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Syrians, Iraqis, Nigerians and Afghans sitting in detention centers. The creators of so-called sanctuary cities who embrace migrants might rethink their role if they considered harboring the Chinese migrant who paid $70,000 to be guided by a cartel member under the border through a tunnel to a safe house in Calexico or San Ysidro.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's hostility to immigration and his appeal to old-fashioned Americana is seen as nativist and sometimes racist. This is a delicate subject, but the question of roots has been a theme in elections in Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Britain, and to say it is irrelevant is a mistake. Anyone who came of age in 1950s America has witnessed a doubling of the U.S. population and an enormous cultural shift. Its upside is diversity, of course; its downside is an erosion of historical memory, and culture shock.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, it's a pity that young immigrants, and plenty of young people generally, have never heard of Elvis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins or Annette Funicello. It's of greater concern to me that the names Emmett Till and Rosa Parks are so seldom invoked; that there is so little awareness of America's tradition of dissent, or of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s hope to live in a nation where people \"will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To write off Trump's message, or to see his voters as racist and deplorable, is to miss the point. It is not that the Democrats' elite are geriatrics, though they certainly are; it is that they are too entrenched, too tone deaf and out of touch in myriad ways. The Clintons need to retire to discover the ambiguous pleasures of obscurity that the rest of us already know. Barack Obama is as eloquent as ever, and inspirational, but he needs to understand the dismay many of us feel when seeing him and his fellow Democrats taking money from big companies that outsource work and exploit foreign workers, all the while sucking up to celebrities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A blue wave is predicted for the midterms. I'm not convinced of it. Trump proved most polls wrong for a reason. In Britain, a shy Tory is someone who will not reveal his or her intended vote to a pollster. There are many loud Trumpers, but there are shy Trumpers, too. So I distrust polls more than ever, especially as \u2014 after Trump won, and voters became more vocal \u2014 I discovered that many in my large and lovable and liberal-minded family, and maybe yours too, revealed themselves as shy Trumpers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By ;Paul Theroux</p>\n"}
{"id": "1898902564.xml", "text": "<h2>How to improve NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A few days after marking its first 100 days in office, the Trump administration closed in on another milestone: $300 billion. That's the total value of goods that crossed U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico between Inauguration Day and April 29.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump was presented with a similar data point before he tacked away from a decision to \"terminate\" the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. According to the Washington Post, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross showed the president a map indicating areas of the United States that would be harmed by the collapse of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, including many that are home to the president's core supporters. Canada is the No. 1 destination for U.S. exports. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> with Mexico supports 6 million American jobs, from corn farmers in Iowa to auto workers in South Carolina. With integrated manufacturing, it's more accurate to speak of a North American auto industry than a strictly American one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After the briefing, and phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Trump announced that he'd defer termination in favor of renegotiation. This is encouraging news. Not only did Trump avoid a crisis that would have hit U.S. manufacturing, services, farming and consumers, he also recognized a central, underlying truth about the much-maligned <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal: It is wiring that connects and provides power to large parts of the American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it needs an update. We each endeavored during the Clinton and Obama administrations to improve the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement to better serve American workers and consumers. We see an opportunity to seize this challenging political moment and grow the U.S. economy in ways that benefit more Americans, including those who've rallied behind Trump's anti-free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> message, by modernizing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. negotiators should not throw up barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or impose border taxes, which will inflict collateral damage on millions of American workers and consumers. Rather, they should write rules for economic areas not included in the original agreement a quarter century ago, including energy, digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and e-commerce. There is also room to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental standards and increase the domestic content required for cars and other products; indeed, rules of origin for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are tweaked on a regular basis. These updates, handled carefully, should make the United States more competitive globally, not less.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration can further use negotiations to advance American interests in areas such as regional security and immigration. Of course these topics are already under discussion. Over the last four years, the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue has, among other things, established a shared, data-based framework for identifying new border infrastructure needs, developed a common agenda for smoothing business regulations and promoted the seamless flow of energy across the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has always been a means to an end larger than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. It cemented ties with our neighbor to the north. It was instrumental in helping the United States and Mexico climb out of a deep hole of mutual distrust and hostility. Both of us have made many official trips to Mexico. We've witnessed the breathtaking shift in the image of the United States from negative to positive. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deserves much of the credit for transforming North America from a region characterized by suspicion into one where together we can confront transnational security and economic threats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any upcoming renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with our neighbors also provides an opening for self-examination. Many Americans feel left behind by the global economy. The great challenge of our time is how to address this critical issue -- not with an insufficient <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Adjustment Assistance package tacked onto a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, but holistically. We must develop a robust, independent strategy to arm American workers with the skills they need to adapt not only to globalization but also to technological advances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's campaign placed concerns about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> front and center. He now leads a nation -- and an administration -- that is deeply divided over its approach to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. As he learns more about the realities of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, he has an opportunity to improve it. At the same time, our nation must develop a robust domestic job training strategy and strengthen the safety net for American workers. That's what \"winning\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> requires.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: FLAGS fly at the United States-Canada border in Pittsburgh, N.H.; Canada is the No. 1 destination for U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:Don Emmert AFP/Getty Images</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Mack McLarty was White House chief of staff and special envoy to the Americas under President Clinton.

Her Members in swing districts are also eager for a legislative achievement, and the USMCA would give them something besides impeachment to show for two years in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal includes myriad concessions to labor unions, including a rule that at least 75% of auto content be made in North America and 40% by workers earning an average of $16 per hour. But liberal Democrats are demanding more changes before Mrs. Pelosi brings the deal to the floor -- though they still won't promise to vote for it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One demand is to reduce protections for biologic drugs such as gene and cell therapies. The USMCA includes 10 years of market exclusivity, which is five more than Mexico currently provides and two more than Canada. The U.S. allows drug makers to sell biologics for 12 years before generic biosimilars can be introduced.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Longer market protections give manufacturers more time to recoup investment in drug development. This is especially important for biologics, which are expensive to manufacture and often treat rare diseases. A drug that treats a few dozen patients each year could take more than a decade of sales to recover the investment. Manufacturers might also respond to a shorter exclusivity period by introducing therapies at higher prices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Democrats oppose USMCA's biologic protections because they want to force drug makers to lower prices. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with 10 years of market exclusivity would mean Congress couldn't make it five or fewer later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump might not care if drug makers are thrown over the side to pass USMCA, but stronger protections for biologics advance his goal of stopping other countries from free-riding on U.S. innovation. Mr. Lighthizer has also touted the USMCA's drug protections as an improvement on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the eight years of market exclusivity in the Trans-Pacific Partnership that the President walked away from.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats also want to strip USMCA's liability protections for tech platforms modeled on Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. This law gives Facebook, Google and other internet companies legal immunity to remove illicit user-generated content such as child pornography, and it's one reason the U.S. is a global incubator of innovation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many on the left and right want to gut Section 230 because they think U.S. tech platforms have become too powerful. Mr. Trump seems to agree, though digital <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protections are among USMCA's only improvements over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Does Mr. Trump want trial lawyers in Mexico shaking down U.S. tech companies any more than he wants France taxing them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's chief negotiator Jesus Seade has said most changes to USMCA that Democrats are demanding are \"improvements.\" They may be for Mexico, but they will hurt U.S. businesses that have supported USMCA, warts and all, out of fear that the President will pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if Congress rejects the deal.

{"id": "293034785.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD Clinton Backslides on Bold Initiative for Western Hemisphere</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is less than five months since President Bill Clinton presided over a summit of Latin American chiefs of state in Miami, at which the goal of a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone for the Americas was proclaimed. Two weeks later, Mexico was struck by an economic crisis. Ever since, the most creative U.S. foreign-policy initiative of the 1990s-the Partnership of the Americas-has been in jeopardy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>South America is preoccupied with avoiding the experience of Mexico. Brazil is fostering Mercosur, an association of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, as the forerunner of a possible Latin American free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone. Argentina, convinced that devaluation had started the Mexican slide, has opted for a stabilization program that looks to Brazil to spur its growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both initiatives can lead to important progress, provided the United States remain committed to a wider concept of Western Hemisphere cooperation. If Argentina succeeds, it will set an example of how to avoid the vicious circle of adjusting currencies to offset inadequate domestic policies. Growth in the Western Hemisphere would be fueled by stable exchange rates imposing domestic discipline. Brazil's new dynamism, too, could provide an intermediate stage for the southern part of the Western Hemisphere until a global Western Hemisphere organization emerges.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All these hopeful prospects presuppose that the United States will hold the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement together, demonstrate continuing understanding for Mexico's plight, adopt a constructive attitude toward Mercosur and engage in a permanent political dialogue with Brazil. Otherwise, there is a real danger that America may become marginalized in what it has heretofore considered its own hemisphere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. Western Hemisphere policy cannot confine itself to providing relief for Mexico. Nor should it acquiesce in the fashionable tendency to blame <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for Mexico's travail. For stability in Mexico would be in our self-interest even if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had never been heard of.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A vital Western Hemisphere structure is also important for economic reasons. If the new principles of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization come to permeate the world economic community, a Western Hemisphere structure would encourage cooperation among the nations of the Americas within their own region. If the WTO develops slowly, a Western Hemisphere structure will facilitate competition with other regional groupings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ultimate challenge before U.S. Western Hemisphere policy, however, is political, not economic. Mexico's travail was the outgrowth of success, not failure. To smear Mexico's achievements of the past decade retroactively is to play the game of those who prefer statist economics and authoritarian rule.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the countries of Mercosur-especially Argentina and Brazil, which are striking out on their own-have some advantages over Mexico. The percentage of foreign investment represented by speculative capital is much lower. Political reform is much more advanced. In Argentina, President Carlos Menem and his finance minister, Domingo Cavallo, seem determined to handle its financial problems by deflation rather than by inflation and, unless Brazil were to alter its exchange policy dramatically, bid fair to succeed. Brazil has ended years of political uncertainty with the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who, as finance minister, stabilized the Brazilian currency and seems dedicated to fostering privatization and market economics. If Brazil pursues his economic policies, it could become the strongest country in South America. This will give a new impetus to Mercosur, the South American counterpart to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The current crisis, then, is an opportunity to remove the remaining hurdles on the road to democracy and free markets in the Western Hemisphere. This makes it imperative for the United States to put forward its vision of how to use the decade envisaged by the Miami summit for the creation of a Western Hemisphere free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Attention will have to be paid to the role of purely portfolio capital in destabilizing fragile economies. So long as banks were the chief source of credit for Latin America, financial crises were handled by a relatively small number of institutions that had a stake in the long-term well-being of the host country. But the rapid expansion of credit in the late 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, and especially in Mexico, was driven by investment funds and individuals whose primary motivation was to maximize immediate gains. They had no incentive for long-term solutions; instead, they would keep their capital in a particular country only so long as it earned the highest return and would withdraw-indeed, felt obliged by their fiduciary responsibility to do so-as soon as problems emerged. Speculative flight magnified the difficulties national policy failures had caused. A long-term economic policy for the hemisphere should therefore try to create incentives for direct investment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the ultimate challenge is political. In Mexico, the dominance of the governing party is ending, but a new system is not yet apparent. It is in our national interest to facilitate evolution by establishing a relation between economic-restructuring proposals and what the political system and social cohesion can bear. Despite its internal difficulties-indeed, precisely because of them-Mexico should be treated less as a ward and more as an important partner of the United States. It should be conspicuously and regularly consulted at a high level, not just on bilateral issues, but on major problems, especially those concerning the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In elaborating the vision of a Western Hemisphere community sketched at the Miami summit, there is a need for closer cooperation between the United States and the southern cone countries, and particularly Brazil as an emerging giant. In 1975, Brazil and the United States signed an agreement to consult before undertaking major initiatives in the Western Hemisphere. The time is propitious to implement these provisions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the key issues for consultation should be the eventual merging of Mercosur and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which, of course, requires that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> continues to be fostered. It cannot be in the U.S. interest that Mercosur thrives while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> withers and the United States becomes a bystander in a Western Hemisphere where Brazil and Argentina assume the leading positions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Western Hemisphere policy may turn out to be the Clinton Administration's most enduring foreign-policy legacy, but only if it is prepared to live up to the vision it put forward in Miami.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>DRAWING: , (...)

{"id": "1841700508.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico Reacts to the Trump Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the sharp selloff of the Mexican peso after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump were set to music it might sound like a funeral dirge, the dearly departed being the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). The peso has fallen to an all-time low of more than 20 to the dollar, and on Thursday the Bank of Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate to stem the bleeding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico investors are worried that Mr. Trump might actually believe -- as he argued in his campaign -- that U.S. productivity growth and job creation depend on renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to discourage U.S. investments south of the border. But Mexico won't easily yield to a new deal that limits its access to U.S. markets in order to make it less attractive as a destination for capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump counters with tariff hikes in violation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico is likely to respond with its own duty increases. It did this with $2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. export products in 2009 when the U.S. failed to live up to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligation in trucking. There is even the possibility that Mr. Trump will carry out his threat to tear up the agreement. There are no winners in any of these narratives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 23 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was launched, Mexico has cultivated a middle-class, a more-vibrant democracy and a diversified economy far less dependent than it once was on oil. The country now sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would be an economic disaster and open the door to political instability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus it won't be so easy for Mr. Trump to bully the neighbors. National pride will play a role in stiffening the Mexican spine, and President Enrique Pena Nieto's government is signaling that it intends to face any crisis by deepening structural reforms, getting its fiscal house in order and looking more aggressively for new trading partners. The unspoken message to Mr. Trump is that if he plays the protectionist game, Mexico is ready to raise the stakes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s demise would be bad for the U.S. too, although the U.S. stock market rally suggests that the fear of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war is overblown. Protectionist steel and textile tycoon Wilbur Ross is rumored to be in line for a job in the new administration. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r from Indiana, which in 2015 exported $4.8 billion in goods to Mexico, its second-largest export market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time Mr. Trump has had flashes of sanity on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In a joint press conference with Mr. Pena Nieto in Mexico in August, then-candidate Trump spoke of the need to \"keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some expect the Trump administration to find a way to largely leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone while it works on legitimate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues like China's practice of intellectual-property theft. Mexico seems to want to help in this face-saving endeavor and has wisely decided not to escalate the rhetoric. It doesn't need to: Americans have plenty to lose if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many U.S. corporations are now heavily invested in supply chains that crisscross the continent to create globally competitive products. These support millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Saying goodbye to duty-free access to Mexico under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also would hit U.S. agricultural exports hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters on Nov. 10 that his government is \"ready to talk so we can explain the strategic importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for the region. Here we're not talking about . . . renegotiating it, we're simply talking about dialogue.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also said Mexico will look for new markets, adding to more than 40 existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. It had hoped for expanded opportunities via the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that includes the U.S. and much of Asia. But President Obama wasn't able to get TPP through Congress and Mr. Trump has promised to kill it. Mr. Guajardo said that Mexico will pursue the possibility of completing a smaller TPP with the countries that are expected to have ratified it by the end of 2016. He named Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Australia would probably be eager to replace the U.S. as Mexico's chief food supplier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this would make up for the loss of U.S. market access under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which means that increasing Mexican competitiveness is urgent. Mr. Pena Nieto got historic constitutional reforms in energy and telecommunications through his Congress in 2013. Opening these markets to competition will attract capital and improve the infrastructure for producers but implementation takes time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately the government's debt burden has increased sharply in recent years and taxes have gone up, adding to disappointing economic performance.

If the authorities succeed, we should all commend them for their patience, not berate them for indulging the madman by engaging with him, or for failing to reply in kind to his insulting language.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why then are so many people criticizing Mexico for allowing itself to be \u201cused\u201d by President Trump in this week\u2019s (admittedly bizarre) announcement of a preliminary U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal? Mexico\u2019s negotiators, working closely with their U.S. counterparts, and assisted by U.S. business interests and U.S. farm state legislators, managed to engage with an erratic president who\u2019d bizarrely demonized Mexico since the first days of his campaign and threatened to blow up the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House press conference announcing the breakthrough was a fairly humiliating affair for all present not named Donald, and for the glaringly absent party from the proceedings, a large U.S. neighbor that is not Mexico. Trump rambled on to his pal \u201cEnrique\u201d (on speaker phone) about their close friendship, about how he\u2019s often misunderstood, about how they don\u2019t really need Canada anymore, and about how bad the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was for the United States. Pe\u00f1a Nieto replied with that precise formalism that Latin American politicians have elevated to an art form, at one point acknowledging Trump\u2019s (whom he called \u201cMr. President\u201d throughout) \u201cpolitical will\u201d to get the two countries to an agreement, though he must have mentioned the need to bring Canada into the fold about a dozen times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everyone playing a part in Trump\u2019s charade (other than Trump himself) knew full well that this was not a \u201cnew\u201d bilateral agreement that would supersede the bad old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and knew that as a legal, economic and strategic matter Canada must remain a member of the North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc. They also appreciated, however, that the only way to break the impasse, and to get Trump to put down the proverbial bomb without detonating it, was to allow him his full-blown tantrum aimed at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had somehow (no one is sure how exactly) offended the U.S. president earlier this summer in the aftermath of the G-20 Summit in Ottawa.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics who bashed Mexico\u2019s leadership for going along with the White House\u2019s charade missed the point. In dealing with Trump, as his staff well knows and foreign leaders are coming to appreciate, you endure tactical humiliations to preserve or secure larger strategic imperatives.

That sentiment has intensified as the economy has deteriorated, a fall punctuated last week by the steepest job decline in five years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) have fed the anti-free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> view in campaigning ahead of the Pennsylvania Democratic primary April 22. Facing voters in a state that has lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001, Obama has promised to stand against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that cost U.S. jobs, while saying Clinton supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the past. Clinton counters that she has always opposed the deal, even as her husband signed it as president, and she has promised to call a \"timeout\" on future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals if elected president. \"I don't think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good for America,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is that judgment fair?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many economists do not think so. It is true that the United States has lost about 4 million manufacturing jobs since 1994, the year <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect and eliminated most hurdles to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Not only are items such as clothing, toys and televisions increasingly made abroad, but so are more complex goods including sophisticated magnets that help steer military smart bombs and radio frequency identification chips embedded in new U.S. passports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many economists blame the march of technology and the increasingly dominant manufacturing role of China, not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, for that shift.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, they said, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a net plus, if a modest one, for the U.S. economy. Even as the number of factory jobs dropped, manufacturing output in the United States was up 58 percent between 1993 and 2006, as U.S. plants produced more goods with fewer workers. Exports are at a record high, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners has tripled since 1994. Meanwhile, overall employment in the United States has grown 24 percent and average unemployment is down since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect. Some cities along the border with Mexico have grown, and farm exports have gone up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"On balance, researchers have found <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a slight positive for the U.S. as a whole,\" wrote Anil Kumar, a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economist who studied the impact of the agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The escalating debate over the future of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements promises to be a stark fault line in the campaign. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is an unabashed supporter of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and the Bush administration is pushing for a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Colombia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even with all their objections to these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, Obama and Clinton have been careful about where and when they have attacked <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Campaigning in Pennsylvania and earlier in Ohio, both places where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is blamed by many for job losses, they have pledged to withdraw from the treaty if it is not renegotiated to toughen labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the candidates were mostly silent on the deal in Texas, where economists said it has increased exports not only to Mexico, but also to Canada, Europe, Latin American and Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some top congressional Democrats have said that rather than renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>  --  which analysts call a difficult proposition likely to produce strong demands from the Canadians and Mexicans, who have their own problems with the treaty  --  the candidates should focus on easing the transition of workers into the new economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not the main reason workers today are hurting,\" House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel (Ill.) wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Emanuel, who served as the point man for the passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> under President Bill Clinton, called for a \"new social contract\" of improved health care, job training and economic development to gird workers for global competition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Analysts point out that it is all but impossible to separate the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> from other economic changes that unfolded before and since it was implemented  --  including other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, increased competition from manufacturers from Eastern Europe to India and, most significantly, China's rise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University professor who served as Treasury secretary under President Clinton, said he remains proud to have supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.

By eliminating tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada and liberalizing foreign investment in Mexico, proponents said, the continent would end up with lower prices and higher wages. As living standards rose, the economic incentives fueling illegal immigration would evaporate, boosters said, and exports fostered by the world's largest free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone would add 200,000 U.S. jobs. Proponents predicted that the pact would help convert small <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada into surpluses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fourteen years later, those promises have not panned out. Illegal immigration across the southern border skyrocketed in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s wake. Meanwhile, average wages stagnated in the United States and Mexico, and the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Canada and Mexico have ballooned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has not lived up to the most optimistic hopes, neither has it been the disaster predicated by its most vocal detractors, economists said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Articulating the fears shared by many union leaders and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opponents, H. Ross Perot predicted a \"giant sucking sound\" of U.S. jobs being pulled south of the border by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, the treaty's impact has been less dramatic. Hundreds of U.S. textile mills closed as Mexican-made apparel was allowed into the country duty-free. Many of those operations have since come under strong pressure from competition in China. Also hurt were workers at manufacturing concerns in the industrial Midwest and elsewhere. Many saw well-paying jobs move out and wages squeezed by the looming threat that their jobs would be exported.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has weakened the leverage of workers and strengthened the clout and bargaining power of multinational corporations,\" said Thea M. Lee, policy director of the AFL-CIO. \"It is hard to separate how much of any impact has been just <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but it is clear that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has accelerated trends that were already in place. It has become emblematic of a corporate-centered <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has produced winners. Agricultural exports to Mexico have almost tripled, while U.S. firms such as Wal-Mart have secured a profitable foothold in Mexico. And as the industrial Midwest has suffered, other regions have boomed. Fifteen years ago, the border town of Laredo, Tex., was largely impoverished and had a population well under 100,000. Now, with 260,000 residents, the city is the largest inland port in the South.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, the Texas economy has profited from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, studies have found, with manufacturers taking advantage of cuts in Mexican tariffs to send more electronics, industrial machinery, chemicals and instruments south, according to a 2006 Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas study. The same report found that the export of Texas lumber and furniture declined after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lost in this discussion is the importance  --  and inevitability  --  of integration across North America and how important it is to the nation's long-term economic and national security interests, analysts said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become this pinata that everybody has put their frustrations into,\" said Robert A.

We're here to arm them with some facts on manufacturing and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, so they won't repeat their mistakes in the run-up to the April 22 primary in abutting Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's true the number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined, from a peak of 19.4 million in 1979 to about 14 million last year. The peak period for loss:  About 2.8 million of those jobs vanished between 2000 and 2003. That period included a brief U.S. recession and a prolonged stretch of weak manufacturing demand both in the U.S. and in countries that buy our products, according to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office report. But since 2004, exports have recovered and losses of manufacturing jobs have slowed to about 100,000 a year, reports Dan Ikenson, associate director of the  Cato Institute's Center for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Policy Studies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And consider this striking anomaly from the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative: Even with those job losses, U.S. manufacturing output rose by 58 percent between 1993 -- the year the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was passed -- and 2006. That is greater than the 42 percent rise in manufacturing in the 13 years before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The ability to make more goods with fewer workers reflects ongoing productivity improvements that are shrinking manufacturing workforces all over the globe. (That includes China, which lost 15 million manufacturing jobs between 1995 and 2002.) But while it's compassionate to mourn the loss of U.S. factory jobs, that loss shouldn't dictate whether the U.S. signs free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those pacts hugely benefit exporting states such as Ohio and...Pennsylvania. The Keystone State still makes things. But it   now enjoys a thriving service sector too, especially in health care, finance and education. The decline in manufacturing jobs mirrors the national picture, with  steep drops in the years 2000-2003 and far less severe losses since then.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pennsylvania exported $29 billion worth of goods to the world last year -- nearly double the value in 2002. A total of 94 percent of Pennsylvania's exports are manufactured goods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and manufacturing supported 661,283 jobs in the state last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pennsylvania's exports have grown substantially to countries that have free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with the U.S.,  according to the Commerce Department. Its top two foreign markets are <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners Canada and Mexico -- with those exports rising 136 percent since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect. The state's exports to Chile rose 164 percent and to Singapore 45 percent since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts with those two were signed in 2004. Exports to Australia rose 44 percent since a 2005 pact, and to Bahrain 140 percent since a 2006 pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those are the facts. Now it's up to Obama and Clinton to be honest about manufacturing and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs will continue to shrink.

{"id": "398366760.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Nafta critics have it all wrong on Mexican labor law</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If truth is the first casualty of politics, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) was severely wounded during the recent election campaign. The specter of lax environmental standards and unenforced worker labor legislation in Mexico was raised as an excuse for reopening the carefully crafted 2,000-page treaty. Its terms should be broadened, argued critics of Mexican domestic policy, to include a wholesale intrusion into Mexico's legislative standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the relative tranquility of the transition, some clarity regarding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has emerged. It now seems that Bill Clinton seeks neither to reopen the treaty nor to dictate domestic policy terms to the Mexicans. Nevertheless, those in the U.S. who oppose passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> continue to harp on a perceived deficit of Mexican law regarding workers' rights as compared with U.S. labor law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one disputes that there are differences in our laws, both conceptually and in practice. In the U.S., we have a diverse number of state and federal labor laws rooted in our principles of free speech, press and assembly. Together they form a highly articulated body of workers' rights. However, in conception and application, U.S. labor law is a system of imposed law where courts adjudicate rights and obligations, and efforts at mediation and informal resolution are relegated to a secondary role. The situation is completely different in Mexico, where an abundance of laws exists, but a system of individualized negotiations predominates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mexico, the commitment to workers' rights is rooted in its 1917 Constitution. Crafted in an age of social upheaval, the Mexican Constitution is written with abstract guiding principles, such as improving the living and working conditions of Mexican workers, and honoring workers' inherent liberty and dignity. In addition to establishing rights familiar to us, such as freedom of association, the right to strike, workplace health and safety, minimum wage, and maximum hours of work, the Mexican Constitution also guarantees annual leave, profit sharing, employment security, worker training and many other benefits and protections. These benefits are, in turn, expanded in the codified Federal Labor Law, which is enforced throughout Mexico by federal and state boards of conciliation and arbitration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the main problems with workers' rights laws in Mexico is that there are simply too many. In other words, the employment context is overregulated. A superfluity of \"protections\" has created a predictable result: Everyone -- worker, union, employer, government -- ignores some of the laws sometimes, all in different specific situations, but all to circumvent the dead hand of overregulation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, a union cuts \"illegal\" deals with employers to avoid work delays inherent in Mexican strike laws; employers, faced with an unmeetable standard to prove \"just cause,\" pay severance to be rid of thieving employees; employees, aware of the material benefits of being in certain labor classifications, kick back salary to union officials; government officials, frustrated by corruption and bureaucracy, turn a blind eye. As can be expected, participants in the Mexican economy often resort to extralegal solutions in response to the burdens of overregulation, fueling the underground economy (soon to be 25% of the work force).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the core of most labor laws is the workers' right to strike. In Mexico, this right is defended by the constitution and is further defined and delineated in the Federal Labor Law. To be legal, a strike must have a lawful objective, such as seeking to achieve a balance between the workers' and the employer's rights, modifying a labor agreement or participating in a secondary strike.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, the right to strike is more broadly protected in Mexico than in the U.S. For example, once a strike is recognized in Mexico, a private employer cannot continue operations during the strike. The issue of \"striker replacements,\" temporary or permanent, simply does not come up. However, a significant difference from U.S. law provides something of a counterweight: A labor organization must give advance notice of its intention to strike by filing a petition with the appropriate conciliation and arbitration board.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This imposes a mandatory negotiation to reconcile the differences between the parties, serving a purpose only somewhat analogous to voluntary mediation under the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in the U.S. This heightened focus on cooperation and consultation may reduce the incidence of strikes though conciliation. However, this process of individuated negotiations, rather than the application of general rules of conduct, greatly increases government interference in labor relations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican system thus abets the forces of stability but does so at a material cost. Lost is a more vigorous, unfettered labor marketplace, in which independent unions freely negotiate with employers and enforce their contracts with strikes undertaken without waiting for government approval. Employers and employees are often bound by restrictions that endanger the job of the latter by unduly complicating the life of the former. But Mexico's stellar economic team is much more aware of this than any outside observer. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Finance Minister Pedro Aspe are hard at work trying to find ways to purge the inefficiencies from Mexican labor law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point is that Mexico has a comprehensive system of labor law and is applying it as its own economic, social and political realities permit. There are substantial differences in the ways in which the U.S. and Mexico protect fundamental workers' rights. Indeed, based on my observations and conversations with Mexican government officials and businessmen, I would argue that Mexico goes further in its embrace of a \"social charter\" than market forces alone would dictate and that economic modernization will lead to a re-evaluation of the Federal Labor Law toward greater employer flexibility.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether this prediction is true or not, it cannot be denied that Mexico's dedication to workers' rights is both real and founded on deeply felt fundamental principles firmly rooted in its history, its Constitution and its Federal Labor Law. Whatever position one takes on the ultimate merits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the wholesale critique of Mexican labor laws is surely a misplaced political canard, unless that critique recognizes that what we perceive as \"failings\" are often creative responses to a system choked by laws and regulations that serve often to undermine the very goals they were designed to reach.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Breger is solicitor, U.S. Department of Labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter:  \"Letters to the Editor: Workers Are Right To Fear <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" -- WSJ Feb. 9, 1993).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>930115-0136</p>\n"}
{"id": "2175681536.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Re-Election Challenge; Down in the polls, he needs a strong economy to have any chance to win a second term.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The paradox of Donald Trump's Presidency after two years is that his main successes are the result of traditional Republican policies. His main trouble has come from the Trumpian exceptions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, immigration and polarizing temperament that motivate many of his supporters. Whether he can overcome that seeming contradiction may determine whether he can win what on present trends looks like an uphill climb to re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Trump will no doubt tell Congress in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, his main achievement has been re-energizing what had been a long but weak and fading economic expansion. As the nearby table shows, the economy nearly dipped into recession at the end of 2015 and early 2016 before recovering to its 2% Obama-era trend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Growth accelerated in 2017 amid deregulation and especially the end to the Obama harassment of business. The GOP Congress and Mr. Trump repealed no fewer than 16 costly Obama-era rules. Growth accelerated again to more than 3% on an annual basis in 2018 after tax reform\u2014and may end up as the first calendar year above 3% since 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax reform was mediocre on the individual side, with tax credits that redistributed income but did nothing for growth. But the tax-rate cuts for corporations and pass-through businesses were aimed specifically at the biggest weakness of the Obama expansion: capital investment, which surged in 2018.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This has led to productivity gains that should spur large wage increases if they continue. The labor market is as healthy as it's been since the mid-2000s and maybe the 1990s. Average hourly earnings in January were up 3.2% year over year, the workweek was up 0.5%, and overall employment rose 1.7%. With inflation heading below 2%, economist Ed Hyman calculates that real wage gains are already nearly 4%. So much for the claim that tax reform hasn't helped workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This economic progress fulfills the main promise Mr. Trump made to his working-class supporters, and keeping it going has to be his priority. With the Federal Reserve now \"patient\" on raising interest rates, the biggest growth obstacle is Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs have hurt some companies and industries willy-nilly, but the biggest harm has been the uncertainty of what comes next. Mr. Trump thinks car tariffs are \"leverage\" in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, but they are also a reason to delay investment until supply-chain and input costs become clear. Tariffs act like Obama regulation as an economic wet blanket, as numerous CEOs attest on their earnings calls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump can help guard against an economic slump in the next two years by stepping back from his 2018 burst of protectionism. First, get as good a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal as he can with China, declare victory, and spend the next two years monitoring how well Beijing abides by its terms. Second, withdraw the threat of car tariffs on Europe as he negotiates a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the European Union. The U.S. economy can't grow at 3% or higher if China and Europe aren't growing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal awaiting a vote in Congress. Mr. Trump will no doubt urge Democrats to support it on Tuesday, but he can't force Speaker Nancy Pelosi to do so. What he can control is whether to hurt himself and the U.S. economy by withdrawing from the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> pact, which is in force until the new one is ratified. Mr. Trump's threat to do so merely gives Mrs. Pelosi more reason to shelve the pact since she knows any economic harm will accrue to Mr. Trump as President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With an enhanced GOP Senate majority of 53, Mr. Trump can keep adding to another achievement\u2014judicial nominees who are remaking the federal bench in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. We wish Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg well, but if illness forces her retirement Mr. Trump could cement what the last three GOP Presidents did not: an originalist majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time in decades.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Democrats running the House, Mr. Trump can't expect much legislation worth doing. All the more given the sharp Democratic left turn on economics and the culture. Democrats will try to tempt him into a tax increase in return for infrastructure spending, or perhaps the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal, but this would undermine the economic growth essential to have any chance at re-election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An immigration deal would be a signature achievement, if Democrats agreed. But to move them politically, Mr. Trump has to get off his Donald-one-note rhetoric of a \"border crisis.\" He has to frame the issue more broadly in a way that promises legalization for the Dreamers and others to put pressure on Democrats. He needs to offer an incentive for Hispanics to lobby Democrats to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Russia probe aside, a restrictionist-only immigration policy has done the most harm to Mr. Trump in the first two years. The early travel ban was a legal and political fiasco that cost him support; the family separation mess hurt Republicans in the midterms; and insisting on money for the border wall put him in a box canyon that led to his recent defeat over the government shutdown. Mr. Trump needs to make a bigger immigration offer to overcome that losing record.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump faces a difficult re-election despite his economic success because he hasn't expanded the coalition that elected him. The traditional suburban Republicans and independents who swung to his side in the final days of 2016 were willing to give him a chance rather than vote for Hillary Clinton. She won't be on the ballot in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats may give Mr. Trump a chance by running too far to the left, but voters may take even that risk unless Mr. Trump can point to prosperity and give more Americans more confidence in him personally. By now we've learned that last point is beyond our counsel.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2097162992.xml", "text": "<h2>No Nafta Redo Without Canada; Congress won't pass a new deal if it excludes our northern neighbor.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump says his new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Mexico can go forward without Canada, but that's more bluster than reality. Canada needs the U.S. market for its goods, but Mr. Trump also needs Canada to join his revised deal to prevent economic harm and get his pact through Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with the economic interdependence, which is considerable. Canada ranked</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>as the number one export market for no fewer than 33 U.S. states in 2016. That includes northern states that border Canada, but also Georgia, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Tennessee, according to the Census Bureau. Those are all states Mr. Trump carried in 2016.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California's biggest export market is Mexico, but it still sends a staggering $25.4 billion in goods and services to Canada in a year. About 1.2 million Golden State jobs rely on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment with Canada, according to the Business Council of Canada. Michigan exports $24.6 billion north of the border, Texas $24.1 billion, Ohio $20.2 billion, New York $19.2 billion and Illinois $18.6 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this buying and selling has grown accustomed to the cross-border rules and zero tariffs under the current trilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> pact. Renouncing those rules out of pique so Mr. Trump can impose a 25% tariff on cars made in Canada would be economic folly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Members of Congress understand this, which is why many are now speaking up to say that Canada must be part of any new deal. It isn't clear that Congress can pass a Mexico-U.S. pact without Canada. Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey thinks that such a pact with Mexico wouldn't qualify under \"fast-track\" rules, which means it would require 60 Senate votes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a tri-party agreement only made operative with legislation enacted by Congress. Any change, such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s termination, would require additional legislation from Congress,\" Mr. Toomey said in a statement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>on his website. Pennsylvania sends about $11.8 billion in exports to Canada each year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Excluding Canada would also make it harder to win union support that could persuade Democrats to vote for the new deal. Unifor--which merged the Canadian Auto Workers and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada--and unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO represent more than a million workers in Canadian companies. A 25% U.S. auto tariff would cost many union workers their job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The major remaining differences ought to be easy to settle. The biggest concerns <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, which provides arbitration panels to appeal antidumping and countervailing duties imposed by one of the countries. The U.S. wants to kill these panels because dumping suits have become a protectionist favorite for industries like lumber and steel. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Rep Robert Lighthizer made his living off those suits as a lawyer for the steel industry. But Canada needs Chapter 19 as a recourse so the U.S. can't use antidumping laws and national-security excuses to carve out big <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> exceptions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government procurement rules and opening the Canadian dairy market are also points of contention, though Canada has signaled a willingness to compromise on dairy. A compromise that accepts Chapter 19 in return for a dairy opening would be a win for both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump says his tariff policy will yield \"smart\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, but a bilateral deal with Mexico isn't good enough. He needs Canada as much as Canada needs the U.S. market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foreign Edition Podcast</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Foreign Edition podcast: Venezuela's currency crisis and how money dies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2315001339.xml", "text": "<h2>Update NAFTA, then move on</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On THURSDAY, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested both that President Trump may be impeachable due to 'bribery' and gave her strongest signal yet that the House Democratic leadership is close to a deal with the White House that would enable the passage of Mr. Trump's update to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). In fact, she said those two seemingly contradictory things within the same news conference. Politics is indeed a strange and wondrous business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thank goodness. Governability can no longer be taken for granted in Washington, much less actual legislation. The impeachment of Mr. Trump along what are so far highly partisan lines threatened to deepen the dysfunctionality, despite promises from Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders that the House could 'walk and chew gum at the same time.' Ms. Pelosi's optimistic words regarding the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> revision, which Mr. Trump calls the U.S.-Mexico-  Canada Agreement (USMCA), were clearly carefully chosen and confirm that she was serious about her pledge to continue attending to the people's business while the hearings proceed. This is a tribute also to the several dozen moderate members of her caucus, many first-termers elected from swing districts, who recognize that it is in their interest \" as well as the country's \" to preserve stability in the hemispheric economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stability is the operative word. Though highly unpopular in many quarters, especially the (often   Democratic-leaning) industrial heartland \" where it was blamed for loss of jobs to lower-wage Mexico \" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, for better or worse, legally defines the   multitrillion-dollar economic relationship among the United States and its two neighbors. To blow it up and revert to the higher-tariff status quo ante, as Mr. Trump threatened to do both in his 2016 campaign and as president, would have been disastrous.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, having gone into effect in 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was due for modernization, particularly to take into account of new developments in e- commerce. Therefore, when Mr. Trump agreed to engage with Mexico and Canada in a renegotiation of the deal, it was wise for Democrats not to dismiss the effort out of hand, even if it might mean ultimately having to share credit with a Republican president for an initiative they had long promised to mount themselves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the merits, Mr. Trump's deal is a tweak to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, disproving his hyperbole about how bad the old agreement was and how good his new one will be. It does indeed improve e-commerce rules and crack Canadian dairy protectionism. For the most part, though, the USMCA deal is about managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Its key provisions would set minimum autoworker wages in Mexico and guarantee higher North American content for cars and trucks made in the three signatory countries, so as to protect U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The realistic alternative, though, is a rupture with Mexico and Canada, which is why Ms. Pelosi and the moderates in her caucus are right to work with Mr. Trump, and why we hope they will see the USMCA through to House passage, send it to the GOP Senate for likely approval \" and then move on to other business, impeachment included.</p>\n"}
{"id": "434056665.xml", "text": "<h2>A Small and Dangerous Spat</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has been warning that tit-for-tat protectionism could drive the world into an even worse economic slump than it is already in. He is right. Unfortunately, Congress doesn't seem to be listening.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The $410 billion spending bill that Mr. Obama signed into law last week cuts off financing for a pilot program that allows Mexican trucks to deliver goods across the United States. The move clearly violates the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which promised -- starting in 2000 -- to open cargo transport throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada to carriers from all three countries. This week, Mexico retaliated, leveling tariffs against $2.4 billion worth of American imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both the United States and Mexico must be careful. A full-fledged fight could threaten more than $350 billion in annual commerce between the two countries. That is clearly in nobody's interest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An arbitration panel ruled in 2001 that the United States was in breach of its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligations on Mexican trucks. But thanks to the Teamsters union and its allies in Congress, all but a small number of Mexican carriers are restricted to operating within a 25-mile band from the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truck drivers' argument that Mexican trucks are unsafe is spurious --  a flimsy cover for protectionism. Data from the Department of Transportation show that Mexican trucks and drivers operating in the United States -- along the border and in the pilot program -- have a better inspection record, with fewer violations, than their American counterparts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has so far shown a worrying ambivalence about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. He has called for renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, creating anxiety in both Ottawa and Mexico City -- claiming that this can somehow be done without harming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. While he managed to persuade Congressional Democrats to water down a \"Buy American\" provision in the fiscal stimulus package, he did not get them to pull it altogether.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We understand the White House did not want to threaten the passage of the spending bill by raising a ruckus over Mexican trucking, a comparatively minor issue. But it is time for Mr. Obama to put some political muscle behind his declared support for open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He can start by persuading Congress to revive the truck pilot program or start a new one. And he must make clear that -- sometime soon -- all properly inspected Mexican trucks must be able to work throughout the country, as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires. That would not only solve this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> spat, but it would provide the world with needed reassurance that the United States will stand by its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements in these difficult times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "1661212339.xml", "text": "<h2>Will the GOP deliver Obama's best legacy?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Froman received from a Harvard Law School classmate, Barack Obama, a job that validates the axiom that the unlikelihood of any negotiation reaching agreement grows by the square of the number of parties involved. In <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, even one's own country is troublesome, as the catfish conundrum illustrates. And the degree of difficulty in achieving a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact is proportional to the number of Democrats in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Froman's goal is completion and ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific nations, from Chile to South Korea, that generate 37 percent of the world's economic product. The TPP aims not just to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but also to reform some of these nations' domestic policies, particularly concerning labor and environmental issues, partly to entice certain Democratic constituencies to soften their opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some developing nations, such as Vietnam, welcome some compulsory rationality - being required by trading rules to limit subsidies to sclerotic state-owned enterprises. But beware of ostensibly altruistic protectionism - protectionism with moral pretensions. Sometimes poorer nations want higher standards forced on them. Other times rich nations use higher standards to raise production costs in, and thereby lower the competitiveness of, poorer countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Negotiation and ratification of the TPP will be easier if Congress gives Obama what prior presidents have received - \"fast-track\" authority guaranteeing an up-or-down vote on the agreement without amendments. But Obama's aggressive aggrandizement of executive power through unilateral actions (regarding the Affordable Care Act, immigration, etc.) has been unprecedented in its sweep and undisguised in its disdain for Congress. This has produced the much-praised but elusive joy of bipartisanship: Conservative Republicans, eager to express separation-of-powers rectitude, are joining liberal Democrats, eager to derail any agreement, in opposing fast track.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immersed in this political equivalent of three- dimensional chess, the administration is serenely confident that enough Democratic votes will join with large majorities of Republicans to ratify what is negotiated, even without fast track. Even if Republicans representing Southern catfish farmers must be mollified by restricting imports of Asian catfish that are processed in American plants in blue states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two largest achievements during Bill Clinton's presidency occurred in spite of Democrats. Welfare reform was forced upon him by a Republican-controlled Congress (he vetoed it twice before relenting), and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was ratified in spite of congressional Democrats (a majority of whom voted against it). Now, the TPP - potentially the best result of the Obama years - depends on Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are plucking up the protectionist banner unfurled by 19th-century Republicans, who were tireless defenders of the strong (manufacturers) against consumers. Today, many Democrats agree with Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who says that the United States \"has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Notice the slippery language (\"since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\"), and remember the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy: The rooster crows and then the sun rises, therefore the crowing caused the sunrise. Manufacturing jobs have been declining as a share of total employment since 1950 and in actual number since 1979. But because of productivity improvements, manufacturing production and exports are near all-time highs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Froman says, some imports substitute for domestic products. But many imports are \"intermediate goods\" that go into the production of domestic goods, some of which are exported. And, he says, 50 percent of imports from Canada and Mexico, our first- and third-largest trading partners, are used as inputs in the manufacturing of American products. Furthermore, Froman says, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is progressive in the sense that lower-income Americans spend a larger portion of their disposable income than more affluent Americans spend on such imports such as food and clothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You who are reading this column probably have a chronic, indeed incurable <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with your barber or hairdresser.

{"id": "2114845569.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Instincts Triumph on Trade; His unconventional methods didn't lead to the catastrophe critics promised.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The midnight Sunday deal between U.S. and Canadian negotiators was a decisive victory for President Trump's unconventional approach to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Even the administration's fiercest critics are calling the revisions significant. For the first time, Mr. Trump and his allies can point to significant progress toward his core campaign promise of renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals to the benefit of the U.S. workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement requires that cars be made with 75% North American components to escape tariffs. Forty percent of each car must also be manufactured in facilities where workers earn $16 an hour or more on average. Crucially, Canada has also cracked open the door to its dairy markets for American farmers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump's critics will ask, not unfairly, if the incremental gains are worth a year of upheaval and strained relationships among the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners. Free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> supporters will argue that the new, more restrictive pact will slow growth in the North American economy and erode the foundations of the global trading system. Indeed, there is no guarantee the USMCA will make it through Congress, especially if the Democrats take one or both houses in the coming midterms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for Mr. Trump, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Mexico, Canada and South Korea--and progress in discussions with the European Union and Japan--allow him to wrong-foot his critics once again. Contrary to the dire warnings in many quarters, Mr. Trump's unorthodox methods haven't set off ruinous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars or caused a global depression. And while the new agreements are hardly revolutionary, many Americans not familiar with the fiendish complexity of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations will take the USMCA as a sign that Mr. Trump's aggressive methods work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is likely how the president himself will read it. All the experts told him that he was crazy to go on the attack against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; he defied them and was proved right. He may be less deferential to aides and advisers as he gains even more confidence in the power of his intuition and bargaining ability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's base will likely agree: So what if he's rude to foreign leaders? Other presidents have been nice to them, but Mr. Trump has struck better deals. Do we elect American presidents to behave politely at Group of Seven summits, or to negotiate agreements that improve the position of U.S. manufacturers and farmers?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the one country that has persisted in defying Mr. Trump on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> seems to be worried. The list of topics that China's censors want news sources to treat sensitively is a revealing one. Recent instructions tell editors to be careful with economic data that suggests China is being hurt by the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war, that its economy is slowing, that local-government debt is growing, or that consumer confidence is falling. To <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hawks and China hawks in the Trump administration, this is good news. The authorities in Beijing believe China is vulnerable to American economic pressure, and they fear that vulnerability could undercut their domestic support.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump appears to believe that the same arithmetic that led Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to accommodate the U.S. on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> applies to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. China, because it runs a large <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with the U.S., has more exposure to tariffs. Mr. Trump believes it will ultimately be forced to come to an agreement; he only has to hold his cards, look tough and wait. We shall see. Meanwhile, negotiations with the EU and Japan continue, with both sides anxious to prevent Mr. Trump from imposing large tariffs on their automobile industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition to showing that Mr. Trump's wild tactics can sometimes produce real results, the USMCA should defuse some fears about the supposed radicalism of his agenda. The new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> regime with Canada and Mexico is, like the old one, imperfect, but it is hardly a lurch toward autarky. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in North America will remain considerably more open than it was before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into force. In some ways, such as protection of intellectual property and the inclusion of digital commerce, the USMCA modernizes and extends <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rather than dismantling it. Canada managed to preserve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19 dispute-resolution panels that the Trump administration at first said infringed on U.S. sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the USMCA is a reasonable model of the kinds of changes Mr. Trump wants to make in the world trading system, his goals at the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and elsewhere could be less disruptive--and more achievable--than many fear. He has reset the terms of political debate while leaving the North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship largely intact. Free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents should think long and hard about the implications. Future presidents in both parties will likewise need to understand populist perceptions and craft <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that address them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Walter Russell Mead</p>\n"}
{"id": "422038926.xml", "text": "<h2>Dividends at the border; Saving an infrastructure development bank could pay off for the U.S. and Mexico.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>AFTER A three-year freeze, U.S.-Mexico relations are apparently improving again. Presidents Fox and Bush meet, probably for the last time as presidents, at a summit in Cancun today; the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved an immigration reform bill that looks a lot like the whole enchilada, and Mexico seems to be finally acknowledging that violence on its side of the border is a legitimate source of concern for inhabitants on the American side.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration is, of course, the key issue. The Senate and the Bush administration are at long last understanding what's needed for progress on immigration -- that there can be no effective temporary- worker program without cooperation from Mexico; that such cooperation is politically impossible unless reform includes access to the program for undocumented Mexicans already in the United States; and that there has to be an eventual, earned path to U.S. residency and citizenship for those included in the program, without requiring them to return to Mexico and to wait indefinitely.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico, for its part, is now acknowledging more explicitly, as it did tacitly at the beginning of Vicente Fox's term, that it must step up to the plate and share responsibility for regulating flows across both of its borders -- north and south.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It must contemplate actions such as establishing checkpoints at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico to dissuade transmigration from third countries; it must create incentives for male heads of households to remain in their home communities, for example by doubling welfare benefits and establishing high school scholarships for those who stay; and it must establish disincentives for leaving, such as the loss of ejido, or collective-land rights, after a long absence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this leaves room for hope that before Fox departs office on Dec. 1, relations between the U.S. and Mexico will be back to the high point they were during the first year of his administration. One encouraging indication of this is the decision last week by both governments to abandon the idea of closing the North American Development Bank, or NADBank.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bank is the only permanent institution created under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Located in San Antonio, its purpose is to invest in environmental projects, mainly infrastructure, on both sides of the border, but mostly in Mexico. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus gave President Clinton their votes for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partly in exchange for the creation of this bank. It was meant to contribute to slowing down, if not halting, the so-called race to the bottom on wages, working conditions and rights by promoting this much-needed investment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Its critics have referred to NADBank as the NADA Bank -- the bank where nothing happened. In fact, NADBank has been a slow, somewhat cumbersome institution, and some of its work has been disappointing, mainly because of excessively tight bureaucratic procedures. However, it has also financed 90 major infrastructure projects worth more than $1.3 billion and directly benefiting more than 6 million border residents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, with its future more assured, there are ways to improve NADBank and remedy the reasons for its slow project development. Its procedures can be streamlined; Canada can eventually be persuaded to join; the bank can lend more, and more quickly, and be more ambitious with just a bit more guidance and support from the U.S. Treasury and the Mexican Finance Ministry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s drawbacks have been its omissions: it hasn't helped solve immigration problems, it hasn't created energy resource transfer mechanisms to cushion its downsides in each country (but particularly in the poorest of its members). As things finally begin to move forward on immigration reform, as the need for a North American energy policy becomes ever more obvious, as we move closer to the 2008 lifting of the final <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariffs on corn and beans, it is the right move to also strengthen NADBank, an institution with so much promise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: JORGE G.

(Jack) Murphy, the chairman and CEO of Dresser Industries, has one word to pass along to fellow Dallas businessman Ross Perot: Spain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is Mr. Murphy's rejoinder to \"way-off-base\" Mr. Perot on the subject of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a favorite bone of our pet political terrier, who argues that American industry will be sucked south of the border by low labor costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If that were so, responds Mr. Murphy, whose company is a $5 billion seller of oil-drilling equipment and services, then the inclusion of Spain (and Portugal) in an increasingly open European Community should have opened up a rush of continental manufacturers to that lower-wage turf. Just the opposite, he says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies have spurned Spain, he goes on, because lower <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers permit them to concentrate production in the most efficient sites. Spanish plants are small, with a history of state subsidies. Dresser itself is consolidating facilities into France, primarily. (About two-thirds of its business is done abroad.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, the market for products in Spain grew rapidly -- just as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosters project for Mexico -- and can now be served by imports. (Consumption has slackened recently along with demand in the rest of Europe, but Spain is still more a buyer than a maker. Unemployment is 22% -- and wage costs, though still relatively low, rose appreciably in the late 1980s.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The key to understanding investment patterns, Mr. Murphy explains, is to put labor expenses in proper perspective. At Dresser, he says, they amount to about 15% of total production costs. Sure, this percentage will be much higher in some businesses, but in those that most intensely use capital (in other words, those that tend to have the better-paying jobs) the wage-and-benefits component is going to matter less.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Murphy belongs to the Business Council, the roster of America's corporate-executive elite, but is an especially vocal exponent of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization. That puts him in line with \"90% to 95%\" of his corner-office colleagues on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but can be a matter of more contention on broader questions of world commerce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, he disparages the importance of \"whether an airplane is made in Europe,\" an allusion to the noisy qr0700,0016quarrel over subsidies to Airbus Industrie that preoccupies so many business and political leaders, who fear for U.S. jobs. Mr. Murphy remarks that jet building isn't turning out to be such a smart play these days.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He aligns himself with traditional economic belief in comparative advantage, in contrast to the most pronounced view from the Clinton administration, that nations create their own competitive edges through activist policies. It's still difficult to know where the Clintonites stand on attaching domestic political conditions to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> (Mr. Murphy says don't fiddle with it), but the Dresser chief is against raising <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> tensions with Japan, as the White House and some of its business buddies have done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demanding reduction in a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit or, worse, insisting on different outcomes in certain economic sectors is in Mr. Murphy's mind an error. \"Some of these numbers are getting badly distorted\" anyway, he says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The big share of the overall U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gap that is attributable to oil imports rarely gets mentioned anymore, he complains. (This prompts a brief discourse on impediments to the U.S. drilling industry, particularly what he views as pointless environmental encumbrances in Alaska.) Another basic factor is the propensity of Americans to buy foreign products, which Mr. Murphy says is without parallel among the industrialized nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In general, Mr. Murphy would encourage American business by light-handed government policies. But, like most CEOs, he turns out to have some exceptions to that rule.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Murphy strongly favors U.S. export subsidies, if made generally available. Although such booster shots are a frequent sore point in international wrangles, he maintains they have become commonplace over the last 40 years and aren't fundamentally counter to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. But the U.S. has been a piker, in his view, and that's a reason Dresser keeps nearly a quarter of its production in Europe -- to take advantage of more lucrative export financing and political-risk insurance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dresser is prospecting for orders in the oil fields of the former Soviet Union. It has worked with the U.S.-Russian Business Council (of which Mr. Murphy is a former chairman) to push for a $700 million package of export aid for U.S. producers. The White House plans to make that part of the bailout for Moscow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So the message isn't quite laissez faire. But today, when everything from apple barriers in Japan to \"58-cent an hour\" jobs in Mexico supposedly threaten the American way of life, any sort of stand-up act from the corporate quarter is appreciated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-hungry consumers. And Mr. Murphy's Spanish line is a good one.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398397285.xml", "text": "<h2>Counterpoint: Why Clinton Is Right on Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President-elect Bill Clinton has said he wants to put some teeth into the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement to compel Mexico to do a better job at improving its notoriously weak enforcement of its labor protection laws and environmental legislation. Both before and after the election, Mr. Clinton has faced criticism on this position. This, critics argue, goes beyond the legitimate scope of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, challenges Mexican sovereignty, and makes questionable economic sense. The critics are wrong on all three counts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which was initialed by Canada, Mexico and the U.S., already covers far more than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of goods and services. The agreement will compel Mexico to change its regulation of the financial services industry and gives U.S. and Canadian firms the right to establish banking, securities and insurance operations in Mexico. It guarantees \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> investors\" the right to 100% ownership in Mexican auto parts suppliers. It includes guarantees against non-compensated expropriation and ensures that Canadian and U.S. investors can transfer their profits out of Mexico without restriction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is silly to argue that the interests of investors can legitimately be addressed in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement but the interest of wage earners and the environmental concerns of the whole community cannot. Would any U.S. government contemplate signing a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Mexico if Mexican laws permitted child labor, union busting and blacklisting, and egregious pollution by Mexico's industries? Almost certainly not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Cuomo Commission on Competitiveness noted in its report issued this week, companies that can produce in Mexico for the U.S. market without worrying about child labor laws, worker safety, minimum wage or industrial pollution regulations will enjoy a significant competitive advantage over domestic producers in Canada and the U.S., where such rules are enforced. Failure by Mexico to enforce its laws would be a form of unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for Mexican sovereignty, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is a step toward regional economic integration. Such regional pacts are based on the acceptance of common rules and standards of behavior. Spain and Portugal were not permitted to enter the European Common Market until they permitted free, democratic elections; Mexico has just begun to reform its electoral process. And Spain and Portugal were required to begin raising their labor and environmental standards to the levels prevailing in the most advanced European economies. Is it too much to ask that Mexico begin to live up to the standards it has already set for itself in its own legislation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, the enforcement of labor rights, in particular, is central to the underlying economic arguments for the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will guarantee Mexico privileged access to the most lucrative market in the world. This access will greatly enhance Mexico's ability to attract the foreign capital it needs to modernize its economy and finance its burgeoning <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit and large foreign debt. Much, if not most, of that capital is likely to come from the U.S. Fine, say the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs. Foreign capital will improve Mexico's productivity, raise its wages and thereby increase Mexican demand for our goods. Any American jobs lost through plant shifts to Mexico will be more than offset by new jobs in the U.S. export sector. The standard of living will rise on both sides of the border, illegal immigration will lessen, and the wage and productivity gap between Mexico and the U.S. will narrow and eventually disappear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The key to this happy outcome is the link between higher productivity -- higher value of output per worker -- and higher wages. The problem is that this link is broken under the labor market conditions that prevail in many developing countries, including Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to The Wall Street Journal, average wages are $1.73 an hour in the export-oriented maquiladora sector, where most foreign investment has focused, compared with $2.17 in the Mexican economy as a whole. Workers who have tried to organize in foreign plants and negotiate for better wages have lost their jobs, even been put in jail. According to a recent study by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment, \"The evidence suggests that the Mexican government and official unions have often used their power to block independent union formation.\" In other words, it is official government policy to protect foreign investors against unions and independent collective bargaining.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas appointed a commission on labor reform early in his term. It has yet to make any recommendations. The government has said \"now is not the time,\" perhaps for fear of frightening away foreign investors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The efficiency of foreign-owned plants in Mexico, meanwhile, has improved dramatically while wages have not. Mexican auto industry wages, including fringe benefits, average $4 an hour, compared with an average $30 in the U.S. Yet productivity in the Big Three's new Mexican plants is said to be 75% to 80% of the productivity in the average U.S. auto plant. With that kind of cost gap, no wonder Detroit auto makers are closing plants in the U.S. while pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into new production facilities in Mexico. The U.S. deficit with Mexico in the automobile <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has widened in the past five years. That's not what the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs say is supposed to happen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless Mexican workers get a bigger share of the economic benefits from incoming investment and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> through higher wages, shorter workdays and weeks, and better vacation, health care and retirement benefits, the promised payoff for Americans will not come. Mexican workers will not be able to increase greatly their purchases of American consumer goods. Millions will continue to enter the U.S. illegally in search of a better life. And competition from cheap labor in Mexico will continue to exert a downward pull on wages and working conditions in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bush administration is right that a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement can yield enormous benefits. It opens an important new market for American exports and gives Mexico a better chance to bootstrap itself out of the poverty and misery that weigh so heavily on the entire region. But an agreement on freeing the flow of goods, services and capital will succeed only if it is linked to the larger social issues that divide the continent. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will succeed only if all three partners are held to a common higher standard of behavior.    ---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Lissakers is the director of business and banking studies at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University.</p>\n"}

Here's what he should do instead.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S moods about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> continue to swing. He went out of his way to bash the five-year-old free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal between the United States and South Korea, irritating that ally at precisely the same time he needs Seoul's cooperation against North Korea. On the other hand, Mr. Trump decided not to withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, partly because the leaders of Canada and Mexico asked him politely not to, and partly because, as he put it, such an announcement would have been a \"pretty big, you know, shock to the system.\" Instead of shredding the 23-year-old pact, Mr. Trump will renegotiate it. Thank heaven for small favors -- though in fact the administration had already telegraphed this pragmatic departure from the president's strident anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> campaign rhetoric a month ago, in the form of a leaked draft letter to Congress setting out a (relatively moderate) agenda for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks with our northern and southern neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A statement of intent to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would indeed have disrupted settled expectations upon which depend hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and millions of jobs. In bowing to that reality, Mr. Trump tacitly concedes the tariff-slashing pact is not the \"disaster\" he repeatedly claimed, but something we cannot easily do without. In fact, it has been a generally, if modestly, positive force for growth and modernization in the U.S., Mexican and Canadian economies, whose diffuse benefits to Americans, in terms of expanded exports and lower prices for a wider range of goods, have been offset locally by job losses and other concentrated costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for renegotiating it, the Obama administration actually included some tweaks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Canada and Mexico in the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump abandoned before it could take effect, calling it even worse than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. For example, the TPP would have allowed U.S. dairy exports into Canada's notoriously protected market -- precisely the issue that caused Mr. Trump (and Democrats from dairy states, too) to lash out at Canada this month. A new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiation might also be the opportunity finally to settle long-running, if mostly overblown, U.S. lumber industry complaints over Canadian imports, which Mr. Trump has also embraced of late.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond reinventing that particular wheel, Mr. Trump's negotiators may also focus on the domestic-content rules governing the automotive industry in North America. Small and inefficient at the time of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s signing, Mexico's booming car-assembly factories now supply 30 percent of all U.S. auto imports. Autos and auto parts sold tariff-free within the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> area must be at least 60 percent made in the United States, Canada or Mexico, according to the agreement. But that norm could usefully be tightened, both as a policy matter and as the political price of greater U.S. support for the pact overall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What decades-old relationship couldn't benefit from a bit of a tune-up? If that's all Mr. Trump has in mind for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, after all his huffing and puffing -- if his newfound pragmatism is for real -- then Canada and Mexico can and should be willing to engage. If his change of attitude is just temporary, however, no amount of good faith from our partners can salvage hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}

It\u2019s a wise move for Democrats.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On THURSDAY, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested both that President Trump may be impeachable due to \"bribery\" and gave her strongest signal yet that the House Democratic leadership is close to a deal with the White House that would enable the passage of Mr. Trump's update to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). In fact, she said those two seemingly contradictory things within the same news conference. Politics is indeed a strange and wondrous business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thank goodness. Governability can no longer be taken for granted in Washington, much less actual legislation. The impeachment of Mr. Trump along what are so far highly partisan lines threatened to deepen the dysfunctionality, despite promises from Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders that the House could \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\" Ms. Pelosi's optimistic words regarding the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> revision, which Mr. Trump calls the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), were clearly carefully chosen and confirm that she was serious about her pledge to continue attending to the people's business while the hearings proceed. This is a tribute also to the several dozen moderate members of her caucus, many first-termers elected from swing districts, who recognize that it is in their interest \u2014 as well as the country's \u2014 to preserve stability in the hemispheric economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stability is the operative word. Though highly unpopular in many quarters, especially the (often Democratic-leaning) industrial heartland \u2014 where it was blamed for loss of jobs to lower-wage Mexico \u2014 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, for better or worse, legally defines the multitrillion-dollar economic relationship among the United States and its two neighbors. To blow it up and revert to the higher-tariff status quo ante, as Mr.\u2009Trump threatened to do both in his 2016 campaign and as president, would have been disastrous.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, having gone into effect in 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was due for modernization, particularly to take account of new developments in e-commerce. Therefore, when Mr. Trump agreed to engage with Mexico and Canada in a renegotiation of the deal, it was wise for Democrats not to dismiss the effort out of hand, even if it might mean ultimately having to share credit with a Republican president for an initiative they had long promised to mount themselves.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the merits, Mr. Trump's deal is a tweak to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, disproving his hyperbole about how bad the old agreement was and how good his new one will be. It does indeed improve e-commerce rules and crack Canadian dairy protectionism. For the most part, though, the USMCA deal is about managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Its key provisions would set minimum autoworker wages in Mexico and guarantee higher North American content for cars and trucks made in the three signatory countries, so as to protect U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The realistic alternative, though, is a rupture with Mexico and Canada, which is why Ms. Pelosi and the moderates in her caucus are right to work with Mr.\u2009Trump, and why we hope they will see the USMCA through to House passage, send it to the GOP Senate for likely approval \u2014 and then move on to other business, impeachment included.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2323299983.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump gets his new NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's one thing you can say for President Trump's biggest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact so far: The new version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is better than the one Trump originally negotiated a year ago. House Democrats and the Trump administration announced a number of changes Tuesday that will make the agreement more enforceable, likely assuring its passage through Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once approved, the agreement will replace the 25-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a landmark deal that aimed to boost growth by leveling barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the continent. And while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did that, more than tripling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the countries, its benefits in the United States were offset in part by the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs to Mexico and some wage stagnation (although the blame for that may rest with globalization in general).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was overdue for an update that would hold Mexico to higher standards while also acknowledging the rise in online commerce. The original deal Trump struck does those things, and the changes negotiated with Democrats improves on them. The biggest downside of the latest version is that the two sides didn't change one major provision that pushed the new deal away from the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ambitions of its predecessor, and toward a costlier effort to manage <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the continent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not a huge surprise, considering that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs were largely absent from the negotiations between House Democrats and the Trump administration. Trump had proclaimed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a disaster that cost many Americans their jobs, and labor-aligned Democrats had opposed that pact from the start.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mere fact that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal with the House Democratic leadership in the middle of the Democrats' efforts to impeach the president is proof of Washington's ability to compartmentalize. And both sides had a clear incentive to get a deal done: Trump had promised during the 2016 campaign to end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as we know it, and House Democrats have come under withering fire from Republicans for allegedly focusing on impeachment to the exclusion of any other work. Although that wasn't true -- later this week, for example, the House is expected to pass a major bill to lower prescription drug costs and expand Medicare benefits -- the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal offered the chance to produce something tangible that wasn't likely to die in the Senate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, some liberal groups argued against striking any deal with Trump because it would help him politically without delivering the improvements to labor and environmental protections that they coveted. But that's ridiculous, given that the alternative Trump has threatened -- credibly, given his dislike of multilateral agreements -- is no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the main wins for the United States in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals it struck is the pressure they place on our trading partners to raise their wages, working conditions, labor organizing rights, emissions regulations and other commercial and industrial standards closer to U.S. levels. There's no question that the revised version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada pact does a better job ensuring that those higher standards will be met than the original version did. That's to the Democrats' credit, as is the elimination of a provision that would have expanded patent protection for new biologic drugs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, the new version would still impose significantly tougher requirements on all automotive manufacturers in the region, requiring 70% of the steel and aluminum and 75% of the parts to be made in North America in order to avoid tariffs. The mandate will cost consumers, automotive industry workers or both because it disrupts the global supply chains that even domestic manufacturers rely on to make their products more competitive, and it imposes inefficiencies that automakers may seek to avoid simply by moving car production elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Happily, most of the provisions in the new agreement are copied either from the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal or from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump renounced after taking office, so on balance it should promote <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rather than hindering it. And clearly, the new version is better than Trump returning us to the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> status quo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "398819572.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Mexican Farmers Play Chicken With President Fox</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was signed almost nine years ago. But down on the Mexican farm, it seems the news has only just arrived. And the farmers are mighty upset.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past month Mexico's agricultural lobby has been tying up highways, dumping bags of beans at the senate door and even threatening to take up arms. One news report cites a coalition of 14 groups that has said it is ready to block 48 border crossings on New Year's Day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just why Mexican \"farmers\" are beating plowshares into machetes ostensibly has to do with the implementation of the next stage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, slated for Jan. 1. It is on that day that import tariffs on some 80 agricultural products <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d within <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are scheduled to fall to zero.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The January tariff reduction is a major milestone in North American integration. It is also a headstone for the cause of many left-of-center nationalists, who have made their political careers controlling Mexican agricultural policy in the spirit of the Revolution. As importantly it may mark the end of many quota privileges for Mexican agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What these activists say they want is either a renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that will delay this process or a new round of subsidies. \"What's driving this?\" asks a former Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. \"Extortion. The lesson is the more you complain the more you get. This has nothing to do with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Only that after 2003, there are no more quotas to manage.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is reasonable to have some sympathy for President Vicente Fox, who the machete wielding campesinos seem to have on the run. But before his government acquiesces to new privileges, it should consider the costs to the rest of Mexico and the incentives created by responding favorably to militants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A better course would be to separate the legitimate gripes of farmers -- high electricity costs, a scarcity of financing, feed costs for livestock that can run above world prices -- from those of the organized extortionists, some of whom hardly even qualify as farmers. In doing this, the president might turn the tables on opponents who have blocked his modernization agenda and he could begin addressing Mexico's under-performance in agriculture on his own terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ninety-five percent of the products set to lose tariff protection on Jan. 1 already have negligibly low tariffs -- in the range of 2% -- on their way into Mexico. Yet even where the reductions are more substantial, like on chicken, the effects are not likely to be as dramatic as the industry would have you believe. Sure tariffs will plummet to zero on Jan. 1, from 49% the day before. But chicken legs, which Mexicans prefer, are already tariff-free in northern Mexico. Pork tariffs are low and only revert to a higher 20% after an annual quota is used up. This year, that didn't happen until the second week in October.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point here is that the Mexican agricultural market is already quite open. Moreover, the new zero-tariff schedules are not a surprise. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was designed to phase out agricultural tariffs over 14 years and next month's reductions are on schedule. Even in the importation of corn, which will retain tariff protection until 2008, Mexico has unilaterally increased its duty-free quota above <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> levels in order to meet demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Government officials in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries say there will be no renegotiation. If demands for renegotiation on one point are met, it opens the whole treaty up to reversal. This would harm all three partners but it would be especially dangerous for Mexico, which has made enormous and profitable inroads in the U.S. market in many sectors. Mexican Secretary of the Economy Luis Derbez recently noted that Mexico now holds close to 12% of the U.S. agricultural market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to suggest that there will be no fallout from the tariff reduction or that the government doesn't have to consider some policy changes. For what it's worth, the chicken lobby, known by its Spanish initials UNA, claims that 25% of the 120,000 poultry work force could lose jobs in 2003.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it's not like Mexico is such a bad place to raise a chicken. It is the world's 6th largest poultry producer. It has also attracted foreign investment. Tyson says it has \"integrated poultry operations in Torreon; two plants, hatchery, feedmill, and contract relationships with independent growers.\" Such cross-border operations mean that Tyson thought it could make money in the chicken business in Mexico, even knowing that the phase-out of protection was scheduled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, difficulties competing with U.S. imports may say more about distortions in the Mexican economy than they do about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. \"Mexico is not competitive in many industries because of the same problems that many chicken growers are confronting: shortages of financing, energy and technology,\" says Roberto Blum, president of Cilace, a Mexican think tank promoting development through free markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of granting electricity subsidies, Mexico could open the corn and feed market before the 2008 deadline and remove the prohibition on private investment in energy, a prohibition that despite its pernicious effect on electricity supply is still a beloved symbol of the Mexican left. Another expert makes the point that, \"If the government wants to help hog farmers, instead of giving them protection it should help them solve the hog cholera problem.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. protectionism has made Mr. Fox's job of fending off Mexican protectionists tough. Lobbyists are complaining bitterly about the latest U.S. farm bill. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> prohibits export subsidies Mexico could launch an investigation if it believes the case has merit. It could also invoke safeguards if an industry is being \"harmed.\" So far, it has done neither. But the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council recently sided with Mexican growers asking for a delay in the market opening for chicken leg quarters. It says that it fears market disruptions after Jan. 1 could trigger Mexican anti-dumping action, something learned from the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Any derailment of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> schedule would be a pity. For to the extent that the process is forcing a reallocation of resources and giving consumers more, it's working. For the sake of so many Mexicans trapped in poverty the opening should be kept on course.</p>\n"}

His politics are quite left-leaning, but he realizes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement benefit his domestic economy and ensure that Canada will maintain greater access to international markets and enhanced consumer choice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trudeau was able to preserve Chapter 19 of the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the new agreement. This refers to the dispute-resolution mechanism that could deal with any perceived unfair anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Since the Canadian leader was concerned the U.S. president \"doesn't always follow the rules,\" he wanted to keep it in place, and they did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trudeau also wisely cracked open the door to Canada's dairy industry, which has long been a sore spot with Trump and other right-leaning figures. Indeed, it is a restrictive market governed by the notoriously anti-free-market principle of supply management, in which the Canadian state controls the supply and demand of milk, cheese, eggs and other products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While some Canadian dairy farmers were frustrated with this news, the Liberals only opened up 3.6 percent of the entire industry. In other words, 96.4 percent remains in Canadian hands, and the U.S. farming community has a brand new market to explore, albeit on a very limited scale.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wasn't the perfect arrangement for the White House.

Since politics is a blood sport, anything is possible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Canadians on both the left and right could be irritated that Trudeau gave in to Trump's multitude of demands. The Canadian farming community could also potentially run a campaign against the Trudeau Liberals in the upcoming federal election.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who is opposed to eliminating supply management (a rarity for a political conservative) and has cultivated relationships with dairy farmers, claimed on Twitter, \"Would I have signed this deal? I would have signed a better one.\" Since he has never provided any particulars, I don't know whether his deal would have been better, worse or the same.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Canadians ultimately won't park their votes much differently because of the USMCA. They won't like Trudeau any more, or hate him any less, because he signed a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal to replace an existing one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could be interesting, however, is another role Trudeau could end up playing in this saga: political mediator.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the Democrats regained control of the House during the midterm elections, a small group of young, left-wing radicals joined them. This includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, both members of the Democratic Socialists of America. While this development obviously thrills left-wing publications such as The Nation, it's a huge concern for the Democratic establishment. The party as a whole has clearly shifted further to the left in recent years, but most of its activists, donors and elected representatives don't support socialism and support free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A paper published last year by the Congressional Research Service written by M. Angeles Villarreal and Ian F. Fergusson noted that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" Until recently, in fact, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had led to lower tariffs, new business opportunities and job growth in all three countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's where Trudeau could join in the fray. He could serve as a possible conduit to the Democrats by outlying the positive political and economic impact that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had on the two countries, and why the USMCA would be a continuation of this success story. He could also reassure progressives that the USMCA is something they could use in election and reelection campaigns as a symbol of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> prosperity for the middle class \u2014 and a more fair and equitable balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for all participating nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The establishment figures would likely be content with Trudeau's position, and the young radicals would learn they have to play ball every so often if they want to get support for their pet projects and causes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, while the USMCA isn't a fait accompli, it's about as close as one as you'll ever see. It may even turn out that the last holdout, Trudeau, is the one who helps take it across the finish line.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Read more:Nickita Longman: End forced sterilizations of Indigenous women in Canada</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>J.J.

{"id": "1838935614.xml", "text": "<h2>Squaring Trumponomics With Reality</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President-elect Donald Trump will soon be working with Republican majorities in the House and Senate to reshape tax and spending laws to increase economic growth, raise living standards and protect America's economic future. His challenge will be to do this in a way that is fiscally responsible as well as consistent with his campaign goals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Jobs and corporate taxes. Although there are local pockets of high unemployment, the economy as a whole is essentially at full employment with a 4.9% unemployment rate in October. The key to better jobs is increased business investment in equipment and research to raise labor productivity, supplemented by more skill training in firms and community colleges. Tax reform could induce U.S. companies to bring back some of the $2 trillion of profits held abroad and could provide incentives for firms to spend those funds on investment and training.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies will bring back overseas funds if the U.S. shifts its method of taxing repatriated profits to the \"territorial system\" used by every other major industrial country, substituting a low tax on repatriated profits for the full U.S. corporate tax rate. A 10% tax on repatriated profits would provide a strong incentive to bring back funds instead of investing them abroad. Taxing profits that would otherwise have remained abroad would provide extra revenue with which to finance incentives for investment and training as well as a reduction in the current 35% tax rate on domestic profits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Personal taxes. Top marginal tax rates have risen to 40% from 28% since the 1986 Reagan tax reforms. Substantial reductions in these rates can be achieved, as Mr. Trump promised in his campaign, without raising the deficit by eliminating deductions and credits for everything from buying an electric car to expensive local government services. Eliminating tax deductions for everything but charitable gifts and mortgage interest would raise enough revenue to finance a 10% tax cut across the board. Additional tax cuts could be financed by capping the exclusion for employer paid health insurance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules. During the campaign Mr. Trump promised to tear up the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement if he could not negotiate a substantial improvement. Revoking the agreement would put more than $600 billion of U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in jeopardy. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. companies export more to Canada than they import from Canada. Including Mexico, total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> imports exceed exports by less than $40 billion, an amount equal to just one-quarter of 1% of GDP.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be a mistake, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would benefit from being updated to reflect changes in the economy that have occurred in the past 22 years. Fortunately this can be done without scrapping the entire agreement by negotiating \"side agreements\" to protect U.S. interests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- National debt and Social Security. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the ratio of government debt to GDP has more than doubled in the past decade to 76% and is projected by the CBO to continue rising to more than 85% by 2026 on its way to over 100% in the following decade. Cutting spending on defense and on nondefense discretionary programs cannot reverse this debt explosion. Defense outlays are already scheduled to fall to 2.7% of GDP from 3.2% over the next decade, lower than any level since World War II. That decline needs to be reversed if the military is to protect the U.S. and its allies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reducing budget outlays requires slowing the growth of Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare and Social Security. Mr. Trump's promised overhaul of ObamaCare will help to reduce government health spending, although it is an uphill battle because of the aging population and the technical changes that provide opportunities for expensive but effective health care.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reforming Social Security, which now pays out more than it takes in, is therefore critical. Today's benefits are paid only by drawing down the \"trust-fund balance\" accumulated in previous years, an accounting gimmick that adds to the overall budget deficit. Social Security actuaries predict on their most likely assumption that within the next 20 years the trust-fund balance will be exhausted, requiring a 25% cut in benefits at that time or a major jump in tax rates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump has promised to protect Social Security beneficiaries. But if he wants to protect future retirees from a large benefit cut, he should work with Congress to enact a gradual rise in the age for full benefits, just as Ronald Reagan did in 1983. Since then life expectancy for Americans in their mid-60s has increased by three years. Gradually raising the age for full benefits to 70 years old from 67 for those now younger than 55 years old, while leaving open the option of getting actuarially equivalent benefits at an earlier age, would help to assure that future retirees don't face a sharp cut in benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Infrastructure. Although there appears to be bipartisan support for spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure, this should be postponed until an economic downturn creates the need for fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, it would be good to devote those dollars to reducing the national debt while drawing up specific investment plans to be ready during a downturn.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other perhaps less urgent problems that also need to be tackled. The good news is Mr. Trump can look forward to at least two years with the support of both houses of Congress to solve those problems and strengthen the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, is a professor at Harvard and a member of the Journal's board of contributors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Readers Disagree with Mr. Feldstein's Advice\" -- WSJ Nov. 19, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Martin Feldstein</p>\n"}
{"id": "421718647.xml", "text": "<h2>Commentary; High-Productivity Poverty Is Too Costly</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now that the dust is beginning to settle on the remarkable implosion of Mexico's one-party state, the man who set the charge, President-elect Vicente Fox, arrives in Washington to meet with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore today and then flies to Dallas to meet with Gov. George W. Bush on Friday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fox is proposing a bold redefinition of the U.S.-Mexican relationship, arguing that \"we must be better friends, we must be better neighbors, we must be better partners.\" He has already raised a long-term goal of something akin to a North American common market that includes the free movement of people as well as goods across the continent. He maintains that the U.S. economy is already heavily dependent on Mexican immigrant labor and that the U.S. government is spending billions to keep out the very people U.S. industry is often desperately trying to hire.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fox acknowledges that an important impetus for Mexican immigration is his country's extreme income polarization and desperately low wages. Nowhere is the problem more sharply drawn than at the U.S. border, where workers in Mexico's high-tech export plants, or maquiladoras, earn less than $1 an hour. At night you can see the gleaming lights of downtown San Diego from Tijuana, and the lure of earning a day's pay for an hour's work of busing dishes or cleaning houses often proves irresistible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It is not possible to solve the migration problem,\" Fox said with characteristic candor, \"if we don't solve the gap where a worker in Mexico earns $5 a day, and a worker in the United States makes $60 a day.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The low wages at the border define a perverse new oxymoron: high- productivity poverty. The workers in these export plants produce computers, televisions and automobile stereos with world-class quality and first-rate efficiency, yet they are paid wages on which they can barely subsist. Why are wages so low? They reflect the policies of previous Mexican governments to attract investment, especially through an arbitrary enforcement of Mexican labor law that squelches independent unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The promise of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was that expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and increased employment would bring labor rights in their wake. U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has doubled and so has maquiladora employment, to more than 1 million workers, but labor rights remain nonexistent. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreement on labor documents the problem, but it is far too weak to do anything about it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The issue is not U.S.-Mexico economic integration--that is a reality, is vital and is growing rapidly--but how best to manage it. \"I don't think the market, by itself, will do the job,\" Fox, a firm believer in the power of markets, admits. \"This job has to be done by the intelligence of people, by the intelligence of governments, by the talent of our nations.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fox understands that a North American common market is not on the political radar in the U.S., but, then again, neither was his own election on the radar in Mexico. A first step is to develop a social compact of the Americas, an important part of which deals with labor and immigration issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a start, Fox would pledge an open, fair and effective enforcement of Mexican labor law so that workers could win the right to have independent unions--if they chose--and free collective bargaining. This bold executive gesture would extend the remarkable democratic reforms of Mexico's political process to its citizens in the workplace. Firms in Mexico would not become less competitive. Their productivity and innovation are enough to sustain higher wages. However, Mexican workers would finally share in the economic miracle rather than simply producing it. All of Mexico would benefit, and many of the country's most enterprising workers would have the opportunity to improve their lot at home rather than making the risky trek north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In turn, Fox would ask the U.S. Congress to pass an amnesty for the estimated 6 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the U.S. today and ensure that the rights of all workers-- documented or not--are protected in the workplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, better monitoring of labor issues is vital to economic integration. Mexico, the United States and Canada would agree to modify the labor side accord to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to include the right to freely organize and bargain collectively and to provide real sanctions for their violation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A unique moment exists today to redefine the U.S.-Mexico relationship so that ordinary citizens on both sides of the border can share in the gains. A social compact of the Americas would be a modest step in the right direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00079594</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: GRAPHIC-DRAWING: Vincente Fox, ANTONIO NERI LICON, El Economista, Mexico</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Harley Shaiken is a UC Berkeley professor specializing on labor and the global economy</p>\n"}
{"id": "422191337.xml", "text": "<h2>Deal with the trade-offs; Despite the Democratic candidates' positions, NAFTA and similar pacts benefit the U.S. in the long run.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 14-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement has become a hot issue in this year's Democratic presidential campaign -- in Ohio, at least. When Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama hit the hustings in the Buckeye State, they compete to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s biggest critic. But when they jet to Texas, which is also holding its primary Tuesday, the candidates have little or nothing to say about the pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disparity illustrates two truths about major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals: They're a magnet for pandering, and they produce both winners and losers. Ohio, like other states in the Rust Belt, is stinging from the loss of manufacturing jobs in the years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect. In Texas, however, communities near the border have blossomed with an influx of investment, jobs and workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the differences haven't just been regional. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals signed since 1980 have helped spur job growth for some types of workers while decreasing jobs for others. Men at the high and low ends of the career ladder have benefited, but those in the middle have suffered, while the opposite holds true for women, according to a recent study by economist Stephen Rose at the Progressive Policy Institute.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's job is to take the long view of what's best for the country as a whole. Although it's hard to pinpoint jobs lost or created because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, U.S. employment has grown far beyond even pessimistic estimates of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal's costs. You wouldn't know that listening to Obama, who declared in a recent speech that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage.\" His stance is echoed by Clinton, who scolded Obama's campaign for distributing a flier that said she had called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a \"boon\" to the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The centerpiece of both candidates' positions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that future deals must include \"good\" or \"strong\" labor and environmental standards. That's vaguely comforting and feel-good-ish, but it's also misleading. Higher standards won't protect jobs and bottle up capital in the U.S. over the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the best course is to embrace free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and fight for lower tariffs and other barriers to U.S. goods and services overseas. Protecting U.S. workers means giving them the education, training and, if necessary, retraining needed to compete for the higher-paying jobs that result from open markets. The capital and jobs that leave can help U.S. workers too by fostering stronger economies in the rest of the world and thus creating markets in which we can sell our products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increasingly global nature of business causes pain, but it's better to adapt to the competition than shake your fist at it.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2574965600.xml", "text": "<h2>Chinese Leaders Are Having Fun With Us. Who Can Blame Them?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anyone who says that China's President Xi Jinping does not have a sense of humor is definitely not following the news from the Pacific these days.China last week applied for membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that was originally negotiated by President Barack Obama precisely to counter China's economic power in the Pacific. Unfortunately, President Donald Trump promptly tore it up rather than learn what it was about and get Congress to ratify it, and the Democrats have since then made no move to revive the deal, known as the TPP.Beijing applying to join the TPP is the diplomatic equivalent of the U.S. asking to be a member of China's \"belt and road\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment initiative in Asia, or Russia applying to be a member of the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because it controls part of the Arctic north of Canada. In other words, a deliciously mischievous ploy.But it's a ploy that exposes a real weakness in U.S. foreign policymaking toward China, which has become the biggest challenger to American pre-eminence in setting the rules of today's international system in both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and diplomacy.China's announcement came the day after Britain, the U.S. and Australia took geopolitical competition with China to a new level by announcing a historic security pact to help Australia deploy the most advanced nuclear-powered submarines, to counter Beijing's growing naval clout in the Asia-Pacific region.But we need a strategy for not just containing China with submarines that could take years before going on patrol. We need a strategy for changing China's behavior today, which is what the TPP was partly designed to do.China was never formally excluded from the TPP by its Obama administration designers. But the message to Beijing was: If you want to be part of this American-crafted 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, you have to play by our rules. That's why reformers in China were intrigued by the TPP -- they saw it as a lever to open the Chinese system -- and hard-liners feared it more than submarines.But after the U.S.-U.K.-Australia sub deal, the Chinese obviously said to themselves: \"Let's have some fun. After the Americans were so stupid as to never join the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that they designed to keep us out, America in and its Pacific allies close, the 11 other partners went ahead without them. They even renamed it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). So, let's try to use the attraction of easier access to China's giant market to take over the TPP on our terms instead of America's! And what better way to counter the American submarine deal with Australia?\"It was a brilliant move. As The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday: \"A decade ago, it was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club led by the U.S. seeking to limit the influence of China's economic model. Now Washington is out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Beijing wants in -- as the group's biggest member.\"While China's admittance is not likely anytime soon (it requires unanimous consent of the members), just by applying Beijing is exposing how unserious the American far left and far right are when it comes to China. They rail against Beijing's human rights policy and then they block one of America's most effective tools to nudge -- and that is the most we can ever do -- China toward more transparency and the rule of law, i.e., TPP.\"Reformers in China carefully monitored the original TPP negotiations with the hope that China joining the TPP could lead to domestic reforms,\" said James McGregor, the chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide, Greater China. \"Those days are gone. In its new bid to join, China will likely try to use the lure of its huge market to entice the other members to live with China meeting some TPP requirements while muddying others.\"What makes this Chinese maneuver more ridiculous is that Trump was so ignorant about the contents of the TPP before he tore it up -- his main objection was surely that Obama had negotiated it -- that when he was first asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015, Trump incorrectly suggested that China was in it from the start. Trump was just ahead of his time!But Trump's foolishness had a lot of tacit support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their knee-jerk opposition to the pact -- even though it was designed by Obama to address all the core labor and environmental issues that the left did not like about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.Let's go to the videotape and recall what the Obama team -- not Trump, not the G.O.P. -- O-B-A-M-A -- built into the original TPP, which also included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.One of the largest multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets. It detailed intellectual property protections for the newest and most advanced American-made tech products -- like free access for all cloud computing services, which China restricts. It set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor. It banned trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a practice still common in China that may have played a role in the pandemic. It required signatories to permit their workers to form independent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child labor practices.Indeed, speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \"this TPP sets the gold standard in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to open free, transparent, fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" It would build in \"strong protections for workers and the environment. ... Respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\"Typical of a Democrat, though, candidate Clinton ran away from the deal when she ran against Trump, rather than explain that some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 would-be TPP partners were already coming into the U.S. duty-free, while our goods and services were still being hit with some 18,000 tariffs in their countries -- tariffs that the deal would have eliminated.

Unfortunately, President Donald Trump promptly tore it up rather than learn what it was about and get Congress to ratify it, and the Democrats have since then made no move to revive the deal, known as the TPP.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beijing applying to join the TPP is the diplomatic equivalent of the U.S. asking to be a member of China's \"belt and road\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment initiative in Asia, or Russia applying to be a member of the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because it controls part of the Arctic north of Canada. In other words, a deliciously mischievous ploy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it's a ploy that exposes a real weakness in U.S. foreign policymaking toward China, which has become the biggest challenger to American pre-eminence in setting the rules of today's international system in both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and diplomacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China's announcement came the day after Britain, the U.S. and Australia took geopolitical competition with China to a new level by announcing a historic security pact to help Australia deploy the most advanced nuclear-powered submarines, to counter Beijing's growing naval clout in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we need a strategy for not just containing China with submarines that could take years before going on patrol. We need a strategy for changing China's behavior today, which is what the TPP was partly designed to do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China was never formally excluded from the TPP by its Obama administration designers. But the message to Beijing was: If you want to be part of this American-crafted 21st-century <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, you have to play by our rules. That's why reformers in China were intrigued by the TPP -- they saw it as a lever to open the Chinese system -- and hard-liners feared it more than submarines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But after the U.S.-U.K.-Australia sub deal, the Chinese obviously said to themselves: \"Let's have some fun. After the Americans were so stupid as to never join the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that they designed to keep us out, America in and its Pacific allies close, the 11 other partners went ahead without them. They even renamed it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). So, let's try to use the attraction of easier access to China's giant market to take over the TPP on our terms instead of America's! And what better way to counter the American submarine deal with Australia?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a brilliant move. As The Wall Street Journal reported last Friday: \"A decade ago, it was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> club led by the U.S. seeking to limit the influence of China's economic model. Now Washington is out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Beijing wants in -- as the group's biggest member.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While China's admittance is not likely anytime soon (it requires unanimous consent of the members), just by applying Beijing is exposing how unserious the American far left and far right are when it comes to China. They rail against Beijing's human rights policy and then they block one of America's most effective tools to nudge -- and that is the most we can ever do -- China toward more transparency and the rule of law, i.e., TPP.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Reformers in China carefully monitored the original TPP negotiations with the hope that China joining the TPP could lead to domestic reforms,\" said James McGregor, the chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide, Greater China. \"Those days are gone. In its new bid to join, China will likely try to use the lure of its huge market to entice the other members to live with China meeting some TPP requirements while muddying others.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What makes this Chinese maneuver more ridiculous is that Trump was so ignorant about the contents of the TPP before he tore it up -- his main objection was surely that Obama had negotiated it -- that when he was first asked about it in a campaign debate in November 2015, Trump incorrectly suggested that China was in it from the start. Trump was just ahead of his time!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Trump's foolishness had a lot of tacit support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their knee-jerk opposition to the pact -- even though it was designed by Obama to address all the core labor and environmental issues that the left did not like about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's go to the videotape and recall what the Obama team -- not Trump, not the G.O.P. -- O-B-A-M-A -- built into the original TPP, which also included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the largest multilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that dumped subsidized products into our markets. It detailed intellectual property protections for the newest and most advanced American-made tech products -- like free access for all cloud computing services, which China restricts. It set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions that prohibited turning guest workers into slave labor. It banned trafficking in endangered wildlife parts, a practice still common in China that may have played a role in the pandemic. It required signatories to permit their workers to form independent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions to collectively bargain and to eliminate all child labor practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, speaking on a trip to Australia in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \"this TPP sets the gold standard in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to open free, transparent, fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" It would build in \"strong protections for workers and the environment. ... Respecting workers' rights leads to positive long-term economic outcomes, better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Typical of a Democrat, though, candidate Clinton ran away from the deal when she ran against Trump, rather than explain that some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 would-be TPP partners were already coming into the U.S. duty-free, while our goods and services were still being hit with some 18,000 tariffs in their countries -- tariffs that the deal would have eliminated. By accounting for 40 percent of global G.D.P., the original TPP would have become a real standards-setter in the Pacific.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that U.S. national income would also have grown by some $130 billion a year by 2030 with the TPP.

{"id": "421523586.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD /MEXICO; How to Make Fox's Life a Little Easier</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President-elect Vicente Fox is a man with big ideas, big dreams and a big heart. Soon, he will be bringing some of his ideas to Washington. Chief among them is his long-term proposal that the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement be transformed into something resembling the European Common Market, with regional development funds to alleviate social inequalities, free movement of labor and open borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senior voices in the Washington and Canadian establishments already have said that Fox's common-market idea isn't viable. \"You Americans send money, and we Mexicans will send people,\" was how one analyst described it. But such attitudes are not helpful. Fox and Mexican democracy are in a race against high expectations, and it is in the U.S. interest that both succeed. Preserving Mexican stability is a strategic interest on par with our interests in Israel, Egypt or Colombia, the largest recipients of U.S. aid. The real question is: What proposals can accelerate Mexican development and survive the grueling U.S. congressional process?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Entrepreneurial solutions based on the adage of giving a man a fishing rod rather than a fish will meet with more success than anything that smacks of international welfare or European dirigiste traditions. If politicians are in search of solutions, here are five ideas to consider:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Expand the mandate of the North American Development Bank (NADBank) beyond its narrow mission of funding border infrastructure, possibly inviting Canadian participation. Why not permit the NADBank to finance infrastructure projects from Chiapas to Juarez? Development banks tend to be viewed more kindly in Washington than direct foreign aid. The NADBank has the virtue of built-in accountability, guaranteed by its binational board structure. Moreover, the NADBank has successfully leveraged small amounts of government support into private financing of major border infrastructure projects. This melding of private- and public-sector support for infrastructure development may find bipartisan consensus for increased funding in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Increase the budget for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> institutions such as the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). Environmental and infrastructure problems on the Mexican border have a direct impact on U.S. citizens, from air and water quality to hazardous waste, wildlife habitat and public health. The border has borne the brunt of increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> traffic and requires investment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Support the start-up of new micro-credit institutions, which Fox emphasized in his presidential bid. Expanding access to financial services to the poor is the fuel of nascent entrepreneurship. The U.S. AID micro-enterprise initiative has a modest $135-million-a-year budget, of which micro-credit is the largest component. To date, AID has two micro-credit projects in Mexico, a number that surely could be enlarged should interest be expressed by the Fox administration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Remove U.S. barriers to agricultural <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which result in U.S. consumers paying $1.50 to $2 for an avocado that retails in Mexico for 20 cents. Mexicans pay around 40 cents for a pound of summer tomatoes, while Americans pay $1.30. Removing agricultural <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers would help the U.S. consumer, bring prosperity to rural Mexico and reduce immigration flows. Mexico might, in turn, address the monopoly conditions that currently hamper foreign investment in its telecommunications sector. No foreign-aid program can generate the billions of dollars of economic activity stimulated by good <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Fox has implied a willingness to exercise vigorous Mexican enforcement against illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings along the border in exchange for an expanded U.S. guest- worker program. Congress should take him up on the offer. Free movement of labor is an idea we can agree to revisit once wage disparities between Mexico and the U.S. narrow from the current 8-1 to 2-1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, our expectations about funding levels and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> breakthroughs should be realistic. These proposals hardly represent a fundamental shift in paradigm, but even so, they would take great political will to implement. The European Union currently spends around 1.3% of its gross domestic product on its Regional Development and Cohesion Funds; it anticipates spending 231 billion Euro from 2000-2006. Congress, by contrast, has scaled back foreign- aid programs dramatically. The situation is not more promising in Canada, where Official Development Assistance (ODA) has declined from .27% of GDP to an even more modest .24%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fox will get the most mileage out of his honeymoon in Washington if he is willing to push the envelope on antidrug cooperation and immigration control, support U.S. efforts to expand free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and end anti-American posturing. The U.S. should be willing to think creatively, quit the condescending paternalism, avoid unilateral actions and end the Mexico-bashing. With a little pragmatism and a dose of creativity, this may this be a time of new beginnings on both sides of the border.  *</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Message No: ..ACCN: 00075741</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Meeting him halfway: Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox will need the help of his northern neighbors.; PHOTOGRAPHER: Associated Press</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: M.

{"id": "2348094292.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Credits Trade Deal for his 'Crazy Life'; President keeps promise, does less harm than expected, maintains sense of humor.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Donald Trump fulfilled a significant campaign promise on Wednesday by enacting a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Mexico and Canada. The pact is not as destructive to North America's economy as many investors once feared, and in some ways may be helpful.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The official White House</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>transcript</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of the signing ceremony on the South Lawn suggests that despite the impeachment drama playing in Congress, Mr. Trump is maintaining a sense of humor. Here's the stream of Trump consciousness:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is a colossal victory for our farmers, ranchers, energy workers, factory workers, and American workers in all 50 states and, you could almost say, beyond \u2014 because it's all beyond. This is all over the world even though it's at one beautiful border \u2014 where, by the way, a very major powerful wall is, right now, being built. (Laughter.) Okay? I don't know if I should say that at this particular reading. I know last night it got a very big hand. (Laughter.) Today, they're a little bit like, \"Are we supposed to clap now?\" (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His surmise that official Washington is less enamored of his border wall than are the participants at his campaign rallies is correct. And it seems that few crowds anywhere are as enthusiastic as the people who showed up for Mr. Trump's Tuesday night rally in New Jersey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Victor Fiorillo, a reporter for Philadelphia magazine, attended the event and</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>writes</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you look forward to off-season day trips to the Jersey Shore as a chance to relax, restore and reset, Wildwood was not that on Tuesday...</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I had a ticket to the Trump rally ...one of more than 100,000 that the campaign reportedly gave out \u2014 but, like many others in town on Tuesday, I didn't make it into the 7,500-capacity building.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Fiorillo also observed a \"pitiful\" protest attended by a handful of Trump opponents outside. He adds:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are a whole lot of people out there who think Donald Trump exists somewhere on the Evil Entity Scale between Idi Amin and Satan himself. Hell, you can count me as one of those people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet, when said evil entity is holding a rally just 90 minutes from a progressive city like Philadelphia \u2014 it's even accessible by public transportation! \u2014 this is the best we can do?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I mean, I'm pretty sure that I personally have this many anti-Trump friends and colleagues in Philadelphia. And the even sadder part is that according to one of the protest leaders who spoke, it was organized by more than 20 different groups.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What would we do without community organizers? As for the much larger community of Trump fans, many of them still don't seem to view him as a politician three years after he became America's senior elected official. Mr. Fiorillo describes one young man who had been camping out for the Trump event since Monday morning:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He'll turn 18 in time to vote in his first election, and he'll be voting for Trump. I asked him what he hopes to hear from Trump at the rally. He seemed to think about it for a moment, and then he shook his head.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Honestly, I just really want to be in the room with the man,\" he told me. \"He's like a rock star \u2026 I just hope that I get in.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the White House on Wednesday morning, after thanking Mexican and Canadian officials among others, Mr. Trump made the case for his unique presidency:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two decades of politicians ran for office vowing to replace the [North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement] \u2014 and this was a catastrophe: the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> catastrophe. Yet once elected, they never even tried. They never even gave it a shot. They sold out. But I'm not like those other politicians, I guess, in many ways. I keep my promises, and I'm fighting for the American worker.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This column figures workers and consumers would have been better off sticking with the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Now we're all going to pay a little more for cars. On the other hand, Mr. Trump did get more access in Canada for U.S. dairy and other agricultural products and new protections for U.S. intellectual property.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the particulars of the deal, the President deserves credit for remaining so faithful to the agenda he promised voters in 2016. And according to the President's Wednesday remarks, replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was about more than just keeping a campaign promise:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's probably the number-one reason that I decided to lead this crazy life that I'm leading right now, as opposed to that beautiful, simple life of luxury that I led before this happened. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I love doing it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As he lauded various people for their help in striking the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accord, the President also remained mindful of events on Capitol Hill, and especially the support he maintains among Republican legislators. Said Mr. Trump:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And I want to just, if I could, mention -- because we do have some incredible people that worked so hard, and -- senators. And maybe I'm being just nice to them because I want their vote. Does that make sense? (Laughter.) I don't want to leave anybody out. Hey, congressmen, I already got your vote -- 196 to nothing. The hell with you. (Laughter.)

{"id": "2094042390.xml", "text": "<h2>Has Trump ended NAFTA? Not just yet.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump announced Monday that he's \"terminating\" the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, and boasted that he and Mexico just struck \"maybe the largest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Actually: Trump can't unilaterally kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; this is only a possible step toward any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal involving Mexico; it's probably not a good step; and it may not actually lead to any new deal at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, it's precisely the puffery we've come to expect from a president who doesn't understand what his own administration is doing, or doesn't care.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump campaigned on fixing our \"stupid\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. And, at more than two decades old, this tripartite pact with Canada and Mexico does indeed require sprucing up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The global economy has changed since the early 1990s. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't address major industries that barely existed (if they existed at all) when the agreement was negotiated, such as e-commerce. It also didn't do much for labor or environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, politicians have been vowing to update <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Back in 2008, Barack Obama also campaigned on a promise to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. He ultimately did, in the form of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The 12-country <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact included Canada and Mexico among its signatories, and contained extensive language modernizing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules (including a whole chapter on e-commerce) and raising labor and environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Alas, one of Trump's first acts in office was to pull out of TPP. Worse, he subsequently lobbed new tariffs in virtually every direction, including at our allies in North America. The fallout from Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war-mongering has unquestionably hurt Canada and Mexico, as well as U.S.\u2008firms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But on Monday, Trump proclaimed this front in his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars was over. We allegedly have a new deal with Mexico, he said \u2014 a bilateral agreement that will replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and leave Canada cowering in fear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A lot of people thought we'd never get here,\" he declared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in truth, \"here\" is pretty close to where we were before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is still no signed Mexico deal. And, unfortunately for Trump, he does not actually have authority from Congress to split <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into two separate bilateral deals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Additionally, most of what's in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is implemented by statute. That means that no matter what Trump says, most of its provisions will live on unless and until Congress actually, you know, passes a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law. Which a Republican-led Congress doesn't seem keen to do, at least if the new law in question is more protectionist than the one we have.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress also isn't the only barrier to ditching <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in favor of separate bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Canada and Mexico have each said that any new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that results should include the involvement of all three countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, during Trump's Monday Oval Office event, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said no fewer than four timesthat he still expected Canada to be part of any final agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He even closed his call by saying: \"We'll be waiting for Canada to be integrated into this process.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So did the recent round of discussions between Mexico and the United States produce any results?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sort of. But it's hard to call it progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States and Mexico seem to have resolved some of their differences, including on automotive \"rules of origin.\" These complicated new rules would add burdensome requirements for any cars that could be imported into the United States from Mexico without tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Based on what we know so far, these requirements would likely require an enormous expansion of the administrative state (not something Republicans usually support), raise the cost of cars to consumers, and possibly reduce the number of cars assembled in North America \u2014 which is, of course, the opposite of their intended effect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, nothing announced thus far suggests</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the stuff we got Mexico to agree to would help the United States increase car exports to Mexico at all. \"For autos, I am worried that the main outcome is a changing of the rules to allow us to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> less with Mexico,\" Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow Chad P. Bown tells me.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that's if the deal actually goes through. Lots of hurdles remain, including within Mexico. The Mexican government has indicated that it wants any new deal signed before its next</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>president takes office on Dec. 1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That time frame effectively gives Trump exactly four days to get Canada on board since Trump must give Congress 90 days notice for a coming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. If Trump wants to deliver on his campaign promises \u2014 and get any sort of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, which he seems to desperately want ahead of the midterms \u2014 he'd best stop self-applauding and get back to work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1930581970.xml", "text": "<h2>Lighthizer's Economics Deficit; What does the Trump trade rep have against the U.S. car industry?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Steve Bannon may be gone from the White House, but his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agenda survives in the form of Robert Lighthizer. Last week the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative opened renegotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), and he has made reducing U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada his top priority. But what good is success for Mr. Lighthizer if it means failure for President Trump's agenda of faster growth?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is always good for consumers, but <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has also been a boon to North American producers. Companies have allocated capital to its highest use on the continent, investing where they find a comparative advantage. Two examples are U.S. agriculture and Mexican low-skilled manufacturing. The result has been an explosion in North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Total trilateral merchandise <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has grown to more than $1 trillion annually from less than $300 billion in 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter Mr. Lighthizer's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-deficit preoccupation, which holds that unless Mexico buys the same dollar amount of wheat and corn from the U.S. that the U.S. buys in widgets from Mexico, Americans are losing out. This bizarre economics is dangerous to American prosperity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s many benefits to American global competitiveness is that it allows U.S. manufacturers to access low-priced intermediate goods from the neighbors, add value in the U.S., and then export the final product around the world. Consumers at home and abroad find these U.S. products attractive because they are well-made and competitively priced thanks to continental supply chains. Workers and wages have benefitted too. The growth of high-paying U.S. jobs in technology, innovation, design and marketing depend on this free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> web of supply chains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. car and truck makers benefit in particular from intracontinental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Production facilities in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries ship unfinished products across borders, often multiple times, before completion. It is not an exaggeration to say that free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> access to labor and capital across North America is largely responsible for the survival of the U.S. auto industry. John Bozzella, CEO of the Association of Global Automakers, told Reuters last week that U.S. auto production has increased by more than one million vehicles annually since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and there has been a boom in exports. Whether the industry can survive Mr. Lighthizer is another matter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires that 62.5% of a duty-free vehicle be made in North America. Mr. Lighthizer wants to increase the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-content percentage--though he hasn't said by how much. His goal is to lower the content coming from Europe or Asia that could be included in a duty-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vehicle. This would make production in Mexico less competitive than it is now, and let's not forget that Mr. Lighthizer previously toiled as a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> lawyer for the American steel industry. Squeezing foreign steel producers may also be one of his <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> goals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer also wants to add a new mandate that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vehicles contain \"substantial U.S. content.\" The Lighthizer logic is that this will create jobs in the U.S. Yet if higher U.S. content were good for making and selling cars around the world, the government would not have to mandate it. As Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said this weekend, \"National content is not used in any [<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>] agreement in the world, because it puts too much rigidities to the companies.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer may not want to listen to his Mexican counterpart or to Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who also opposes national content rules. But American manufacturers, aka the job creators, have issued their own warnings.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We certainly think a U.S.-specific requirement would greatly complicate the ability of companies, particularly small- and medium-size enterprises, to take advantage of the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council that represents GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer says he wants to restore jobs that have been lost since 1994 when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was launched. But most of those jobs were lost to technology and higher labor productivity. New employment opportunities depend on new export markets and enhanced competitiveness. Step one is to let go of the obsession with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}

{"id": "1517860698.xml", "text": "<h2>Free trade on steroids</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many supporters of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement are arguing that its fate rests on President Obama's bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan this week. If Japan and the United States can sort out market access issues for agriculture and automobiles, the wisdom goes, this huge deal -- in effect, a North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement on steroids -- can at last be concluded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this view obscures the many seemingly intractable problems TPP negotiators are grappling with. There are other unresolved issues -- such as intellectual property concerns that could limit access to affordable medicines -- that have deadlocked the 12-nation pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And for every issue that is being intensely discussed, there are others that are being swept under the rug. For instance, bipartisan majorities in Congress have demanded rules in TPP against currency cheating, but the Obama administration has refused to include them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But foremost among all these issues is the devastating effect the agreement would have on jobs and the American middle class. Americans were promised 20 years ago that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would bring an unprecedented economic boom and 200,000 jobs in the first year. The three of us doubted those promises and voted against it. The data on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s outcomes make clear that the concerns we and other critics had were warranted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1993, before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. had a $2.5-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico and a $29-billion deficit with Canada. By 2012, that had exploded into a combined <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit of $181 billion. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, more than 845,000 U.S. workers in the manufacturing sector -- and this is likely an undercount -- have been certified under just one narrow program for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adjustment assistance. They qualified because they lost their jobs due to increased imports from Canada and Mexico, or the relocation of factories to those nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even worse, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been used as a model for additional agreements, and its deeply flawed approach has resulted in the outsourcing of jobs, downward pressure on wages and a meteoric rise in income inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, to sell the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-style U.S. agreement with South Korea passed in 2011, Obama said it would support \"70,000 American jobs from increased goods exports alone.\" In reality, U.S. monthly exports to South Korea fell 11% in the pact's first two years, imports rose and the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit exploded by 47%. This led to a net loss of tens of thousands of U.S. jobs in this pact's first two years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now we are hearing that the TPP, as we were promised with other pacts, will mean prosperity around the corner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this agreement would force Americans to compete against workers from nations such as Vietnam, where the minimum wage is $2.75 a day. It threatens to roll back financial regulation, environmental standards and U.S. laws that protect the safety of drugs we take, food we eat and toys we give our children. It would create binding policies on countless subjects, so that Congress and state legislatures would be thwarted from mitigating the pact's damage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Therefore, it is all the more disturbing that the administration has asked for \"fast-track\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority. Under fast track, the president could sign the TPP before Congress votes on it, with a guarantee that Congress -- after limited debate and with all amendments forbidden -- would vote to ratify it within 90 days.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite Congress' exclusive constitutional authority over the substance of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, it would be left powerless to alter the pact, however destructive it might be for workers and families, and could only vote yay or nay on the document.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to a poll this year, nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose the granting of such fast-track authority. Last year, nearly 200 House members, from both parties, declared their opposition to it. The chorus swelled this year when legislation to establish fast-track was introduced; the bill failed to attract a single House Democratic sponsor. This makes the administration's push to conclude the TPP on the president's trip to Japan even more questionable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the arguments made by Vice President Joe Biden and others that the deal is crucial to demonstrating the U.S. commitment to the region or to uniting with allies to counter a rising power -- in this case, China -- are tired claims that repeatedly have proved false when raised to sell past pacts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are many things we can do to enhance our competitiveness with China and in the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can invest in our own infrastructure, manufacturing and job training. We can work harder to address issues like currency manipulation, unfair subsidies for state-owned enterprises in other nations and global labor protections. We can enter deals that increase U.S. exports while doing right by our workers and our priorities, and we can address the real foreign policy challenges in Asia with appropriate policies instead of through a commercial agreement that could weaken the United States and its allies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What we should not do is blindly endorse any more unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-style <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, negotiated behind closed doors, that threaten to sell out American workers, offshore our manufacturing sector and accelerate the downward spiral of wages and benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: George Miller represents California's 11th Congressional District, Rosa DeLauro represents Connecticut's 3rd District and Louise Slaughter represents New York's 25th District.

{"id": "409109561.xml", "text": "<h2>Bush's Latin America Trade Mirage</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With a Western Hemisphere summit approaching this week and the U.S. economy sluggish, President Bush is touting a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement of the Americas as essential to reviving American growth. A close look at U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Latin America and at the region's economic prospects shows how badly misplaced his hopes are.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bush claims that a hemispheric <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal would open major new markets for American workers and companies and help offset the slowdown in domestic business. Yet Latin America's capacity to stimulate U.S. growth, never strong, has been steadily weakening. During the 1990s, despite major economic reforms, the region's annual growth rates averaged only 3.2 percent.  Between 1995 and 1999, the U.S. share of hemispheric economic output actually increased -- from 73 percent to 76 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Add in America's partners in the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- Mexico and Canada -- and the percentage of the hemisphere's market already covered by U.S. free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals is even higher. Although many U.S. companies would undoubtedly sell more to a freer-trading Latin America, from the standpoint of the entire U.S. economy the region has become ever smaller change in recent years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is much growth in Latin markets likely for the foreseeable future. Most of South America is mired in foreign debt, and major countries such as Argentina and Brazil have accepted International Monetary Fund rescue packages that require them to cut back consumption at home -- and therefore cut back imports. On top of this indebtedness, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador will be lucky to prevent continued economic contraction in the next few years, much less generate growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Casting further doubt on hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as an engine of U.S. prosperity is the use of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as its model. Contrary to its supporters' depictions, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> never sought to help U.S. companies and workers by opening an allegedly huge Mexican consumer market to U.S. exports. Instead, the aim was to help U.S. multinational companies lower their manufacturing costs and regain competitiveness worldwide by encouraging them to move their labor-intensive operations to Mexico, with its rock-bottom wages and lax environmental and worker safety regulations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift of production would obviously help Mexico's economy and workers. But because these companies' products would continue to be made partly in America, the idea went, U.S. workers would eventually benefit, too, as these goods regained market share at home and abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> never worked this way for American workers. First, because the U.S. market was kept indiscriminately open to all comers, U.S.-brand products made partly in Mexico almost never replaced American imports from Europe and Asia. They simply added to an existing import flood and pushed U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits to record levels. Second, U.S. companies never displayed much prowess at exporting goods made partly or wholly in Mexico anywhere outside the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Third, American firms saw no reason to limit their Mexico operations to low-wage, low-tech work. Mexican workers have generally proven to be just as good as their U.S. counterparts in advanced manufacturing, and even research and development, engineering and design -- at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s rules were never written tightly enough to prevent European and Asian manufacturers from using Mexico as a transshipment point into the U.S. market for goods they made overwhelmingly outside North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s focus on cutting business costs, and because Mexico's work force has grown so rapidly, Mexican workers have not benefited either. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, since 1994 the gap between U.S. and Mexican manufacturing wages has grown by some 30 percent -- and not because U.S. wages have soared. Instead, American manufacturing workers have seen sluggish wage growth at best, and inflation-adjusted pay in Mexico has fallen by some 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico's unique location and head start will prevent most other Latin American countries from also becoming all-purpose export platforms to the United States. But the ease with which U.S. firms sell goods made in far-off Asia to the United States indicates that many Latin countries have the potential for being used in this way. And even if export-oriented U.S. factories didn't proliferate in Argentina or Brazil, businesses' expanded options under the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement of the Americas to move U.S.-oriented factories throughout the hemisphere would help them keep labor costs low and regulations weak in countries where they currently operate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement of the kind Bush wants would simply perpetuate a strategy that encourages the net export of high- paying U.S. jobs while assuming that a lower and lower-wage U.S. work force can keep importing and consuming at record levels. The magnitude of the current slowdown indicates that this strategy is unsustainable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the president really wants to boost U.S. growth rates and incomes, he should focus on opening markets in Europe and Japan. They might be growing slowly, but their economies are already huge, and their consumers actually have money to spend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council Educational Foundation.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1806996255.xml", "text": "<h2>Clinton's Trade Opportunism</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is fueling the protests at the Democratic convention this week, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren elevated protectionism nearly to an official Philadelphia theme on Monday. By Thursday the spectacle may include Hillary Clinton, though her <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pandering is treacherous politics and undermines her claim to be the superior statesman to Donald Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cause of open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is at a low ebb amid the rise of the Sanders-Warren progressives and the Trump tariff right, plus a lack of leadership in Washington. The latest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalizer to recant is Tim Kaine, who said as recently as last Thursday that the Pacific Rim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal is \"a significant improvement over the status quo,\" only to declare his opposition after becoming Mrs. Clinton's running mate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is now assailing Mr. Kaine for Herbert Hoover-come-lately hypocrisy, and he has a point. As Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton helped negotiate the yet-to-be-ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership and gave some 45 public speeches for TPP. Then to fend off the Sanders challenge, she renounced the final TPP text in October 2015, and getting tough on China, outsourcing and other specters became stump staples. By opposing TPP, she's running against the last major initiative of a President of her own party, and the Philadelphia Democrats don't seem to mind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More remarkable is that no one takes her statements at face value. Her left-right critics think she's setting up a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> double cross, while corporate CEOs assure us that she is merely making a tactical TPP feint and after the election she'll push it through Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This perception of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> insincerity does match the Clinton record. In the 1990s her husband promoted the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and most-favored nation status for China, and she endorsed both in her 2003 memoir \"Living History.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 2007-2008 Democratic primaries, Mrs. Clinton said she would renegotiate the \"mistake\" that was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, promised to defeat a pending deal with Colombia, and told an AFL-CIO town hall that a U.S.-South Korea pact would \"put American jobs at risk.\" At Foggy Bottom, she then lobbied Congress to pass the Colombia and Korea agreements, and she deleted her <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> do-over faster than the emails on her private server.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrat is now bowing deeper than ever to protectionist forces. After Mr. Trump gave an America First speech in June, the Clinton campaign responded in a press release that his rhetoric was \"reckless\" and his \"incoherent approach\" would \"throw our economy into a recession.\" Except for those minor details, the campaign added that he was stealing \"Hillary's best ideas,\" which \"seem to have moved straight from Hillary Clinton's policy fact sheets to his teleprompter.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So is the inner Hillary now a junior-achievement Donald? Who knows? Maybe this time she really has rolled left along with the Democratic Party and she means what she says, in which case she enjoys no particular pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or pro-growth advantage over Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if Mrs. Clinton is merely triangulating again, then please spare us the lectures about \"recklessness.\" Other than pacifying the Warren-Sanders wing, Mrs. Clinton's new posture gains her little or no 2016 advantage. She can't outbid Mr. Trump on protectionism, one of the few policy matters that has sustained his attention since the 1980s, and his subtlety-free TPP opposition has already locked down most single-issue voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton is damaging prospects for the 12-nation Pacific deal, if only by validating the claims of its opponents. This will make it harder for her to pass it if she is elected, especially if she lacks the will to face down the anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> caucus she is now indulging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Assuming Mrs. Clinton still believes as she used to claim that TPP is critical for U.S. competitiveness and to balance China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific, she is undercutting its already dire chances in Congress. She is also knee-capping Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has made TPP central to his economic reform agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearly seven of 10 voters tell pollsters they think Mrs. Clinton is untrustworthy, and the reason is no more mysterious than her political character. She'll say or do anything to get elected, even if means \"evolving\" from pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> first lady to anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> presidential candidate to pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> Secretary of State to anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> candidate back to allegedly pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> President.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton's cheerleaders says she's the responsible candidate who knows better, but the evidence for this is awfully thin.</p>\n"}

Pulling out of Nafta would hurt the exporting states that elected him.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. economy is starting to grow at a faster pace, and deregulation and tax reform are pointing to an investment boost in 2018. But the big economic policy question now is whether President Trump is going to dampen this new growth enthusiasm by imposing tariffs and kicking off a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That issue was in high relief Monday in Nashville, where Mr. Trump delivered a speech touting his policies for the rural U.S. economy that benefits from free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Mr. Trump can rightly point to White House progress on reducing government barriers to growth in American agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the waters of the U.S. rule, which extended federal jurisdiction to prairie potholes, dry creeks and muddy farm fields. Most farms are organized as pass-through businesses that can benefit from 100% expensing and the 20% deduction on taxable income. Doubling the death-tax exemption to $11 million will help more family farms avoid the need to sell when an owner dies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But farmers are scared stiff that Mr. Trump might take a protectionist turn that would impose more government barriers. Highly efficient and productive, U.S. farmers thrive in a competitive global market. But tariffs are border taxes that raise costs for U.S. producers and consumers. Managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> via quotas also shelters producers from competition and raises costs for consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump already walloped U.S. farm exporters when he dropped out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has given Europe, Australia and Canada an edge to meet growing Asian demand for high-value farm products. After Japan imposed 50% \"safeguard\" tariffs on frozen beef last July, U.S. imports dropped by a quarter. Imports from Australia, which has a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Japan and supplies about half of its frozen beef, increased by 30%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foreign leaders are working fast to lock in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that are leaving the U.S. behind. In December the European Union finalized a \"cars-for-cheese\" pact with Japan that will slash tariffs on most dairy, meat and wine to zero from up to 30%. Canada last year reached an agreement with the EU that will make 99% of their exports duty-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is also contemplating tariffs against China for stealing U.S. intellectual property. This should be addressed, but the danger is that U.S. agriculture is sure to be a top target for reprisal if the President gets into a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with Beijing. China is one of America's top farm markets, with agricultural exports tripling over the past decade to $21.4 billion, including $14.2 billion in soybeans. Australia and Brazil can replace many U.S. exports in a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> spat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The greatest danger to the Farm Belt is that Mr. Trump might withdraw from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. The U.S. sends about $18 billion a year in farm products to Mexico and $23 billion to Canada, which together account for a third of American farm exports. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came into force in 1994, farm exports to Mexico and Canada have more than quadrupled. Soybean exports to Mexico have quintupled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the U.S. nixes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the three economies would return to most-favored-nation trading status and tariffs would revert to World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization levels. This would harm the U.S. the most since Canada and Mexico have higher tariffs under WTO rules than the U.S. does. Mexico imposes a 10% tariff on pork, 25% on beef and 75% on potatoes. Those rates are zero under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Responding to Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> threats, Mexico is already seeking alternative commodity suppliers. Last year Mexico reached deals to increase imports of wheat from Argentina and corn from Brazil as a hedge against U.S. withdrawal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump devoted only a couple of lines to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in his Nashville speech, and we hope it reflects what Mr. Trump has learned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the job. More likely, it means Mr. Trump still hasn't resolved the debate among his economic advisers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One argument Mr. Trump should hear is that a U.S. withdrawal from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would most hurt states like Iowa and Wisconsin that gave him his election victory. That's especially true if the U.S. imposes additional protectionist measures--such as steel tariffs--that invite retaliation. After the U.S. blocked Mexican trucks from delivering goods across the border in 2009, Mexico slapped tariffs on U.S. table grapes, potatoes, juices, almonds and wines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trashing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be among the great self-inflicted wounds in history. It would also tell other countries that the U.S. can't be trusted to keep its word on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which would make it impossible to cut the bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals the President says he wants.

{"id": "399101419.xml", "text": "<h2>Washington Starts Another Trade War</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When G-20 finance ministers met in England over the weekend to discuss a way out of the global financial crisis, the group pledged to eschew <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sounds good. But some of the governments represented at the meeting aren't walking the walk on global commerce at home. Instead they're taking the side of special interests that want to weaken foreign competition. One culprit that comes to mind is the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In violation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the U.S. last week again closed its southern border to any Mexican trucks additional to those with existing permits. It did so on the usual grounds that Mexican trucks are unsafe, even though that hoary claim has been demolished by extensive testing. But Congress and President Barack Obama are catering to the Teamsters union, which has spent more than a decade lobbying to keep Mexican competition off U.S. highways.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Candidate Obama ran for president as a protectionist, with a special emphasis on a promise to block ratification of U.S. free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with South Korea and Colombia. Big Labor was a big giver to Mr. Obama's campaign and he owes it big time. Last week he began paying up. During confirmation hearings, his nominee to be U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative, Ron Kirk, sharply criticized both agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet if Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats were not expected to champion freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, some hoped they would not reverse liberalization gains of recent years. The decision on Mexican trucks last week shows they are doing just that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexican carriers were authorized to deliver their cargo to any border state starting in 1995 and anywhere in the U.S. as of 2000. This would boost both economies because some 75% of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico moves by truck. Eliminating the border process of unloading cargo from one set of trucks and reloading it on another would greatly enhance efficiency. New competition would lower prices and improve service.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There would also be security gains if trucks carried cargo in both directions. As it stands now, once cargo is off-loaded in the border zone, the vehicle returns home empty. This creates many opportunities for smuggling drugs, weapons and cash.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Bill Clinton's agenda was similar to that of Mr. Obama. In a sop to Teamsters in 1995, he nixed the opening to Mexican trucks, citing safety concerns. In 1998 Mexico filed a complaint against the U.S. with a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel. In 2001 the panel ruled unanimously in Mexico's favor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mexico was still not home free. In a 2002 appropriations bill, Congress said that before the Department of Transportation (DOT) could grant long-haul operating authority to Mexican trucks, a list of 22 safety requirements had to be met. Yet as John Hill, a former administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Administration, explained to me on Thursday, Congress seemed to be acting in bad faith. \"When the inspector general confirmed that the department was making substantial progress toward those goals, Congress began adding additional requirements in subsequent appropriations bills. And it continues today.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican trucking in the U.S. is not new. More than 800 Mexican carriers -- all of which are majority owned by Americans -- have permits that were grandfathered more than 20 years ago. And their safety record is enviable. A 2007 DOT study of the performance of Mexican carriers in the U.S. from 2003-2006 found Mexican trucks to be safer than U.S. trucks. Even Mexican short-haul trucks operating in the border zone had a better record than U.S. trucks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2007, frustrated with Congress, the Bush administration worked with Mexico -- which was under pressure from its own protectionists -- to launch a pilot program allowing a limited number of new Mexican carriers into the U.S. and a limited number of U.S. carriers into Mexico. The U.S. goal was to prove there was a way to enforce safety standards among Mexican truckers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The 27 Mexican carriers in the pilot program compiled an impressive safety record in 2008, judging by the rate at which randomly stopped vehicles received an \"out-of-service\" designation -- meaning they did not comply with all safety regulations -- from DOT inspectors. Whereas all U.S. carriers had a vehicle \"out-of-service\" rate of 21.6%, all Mexican carriers had a rate of 20.7% and Mexican carriers in the pilot program had a rate of 7.3%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how have Congress and President Obama responded to this success? They killed the program by prohibiting its funding in the new $410 billion omnibus spending bill. This ends new Mexican competition in trucking.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico says it will retaliate, and if it's smart it will hit U.S. producers in strategic markets. This will be bad for Mexican consumers, but if constituents of protectionist U.S. senators feel the pain, it might succeed in changing attitudes in Congress. Given the political muscle of the Teamsters, there aren't many other options.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "398352406.xml", "text": "<h2>Counterpoint: Nafta--Free trade in name only</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The massive North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a 2,000-page tome further encumbered by freshly negotiated \"side agreements,\" is finally lumbering through the congressional ratification process. But before free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> proponents in Congress sign on to this epic of legalese, they should actually try to read it. As <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> unfortunately demonstrates, one cannot judge a book by its cover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite its hopeful title, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> parallels the Clinton budget package, immediately raising <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and erecting a vast supra-national <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bureaucracy on Jan. 1, 1994, while promising tariff phaseouts that don't fully materialize until the year 2009. Meanwhile, the tariff reductions themselves may be repealed by procedures contained in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s little-known Chapter 8. Called \"snap-back\" provisions, the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariffs may be applied against Mexican (or Canadian) imports that \"cause or threaten serious injury to a domestic industry.\" The Clinton administration's recent side agreements allow for the expansion of both import tariffs and quotas under Chapter 8, enabling each country to enact protectionist policies for particular industries for the purpose of, for instance, arresting declining unemployment in uncompetitive industries. This is free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Upon ratification, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will impose strict \"rules of origin\" requiring certain products to be manufactured wholly or partially in North America if they are to escape punitive tariffs or quotas. These significant <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers will cover a wide range of products including automobiles, light trucks, textiles, computer circuitry, peanut butter, orange juice and dairy products. Attaching so-called rules of origin to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a thinly veiled attempt to shield particular domestic producers from foreign competition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Besides overt nontariff <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, the Clinton administration's side agreements create expansive bureaucracies. Established to enforce labor and environmental regulations, these bodies include Ministerial Councils, International Coordinating Secretariats, National Administrative Offices, Joint Advisory Committees, Evaluation Committees of Experts, and Dispute Settlement Panels. This alphabet soup of tri-national bureaucracies is granted unprecedented power to conduct investigations, issue comprehensive reports, and facilitate cooperation between national governments for the purpose of harmonizing worker safety and environmental regulations. Unlike free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s international red tape could easily entangle businesses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A wide range of issues would fall under the purview of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> commissions. The labor commission would have a broad mandate covering such issues as occupational health and safety, benefits for workers, and industrial relations. The commission on environmental cooperation would be able to consider \"environmental implications of products throughout their lifecycles.\" According to the office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, \"any environmental or natural resource issue may be addressed\" by the commissions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> invents a new justification for bureaucratic intrusions into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. While most international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law allows government review of \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-related\" environmental disputes, which requires some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> injury to be shown for the government to intervene, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> environmental commission is authorized to adjudicate over any matters that are remotely \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-connected.\" This new definition expands governmental authority so that any environmental issue with any conceivable impact on cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or investment is subject to review.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> commission may compel more stringent enforcement of any nation's environmental laws, not just those impacting on cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Mickey Kantor himself describes these labor and environmental provisions as \"new and unique, also stunning in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s expansion of extraterritorial bureaucracy is bought with the price of national sovereignty. As part of the dispute resolution process, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Dispute Settlement Panel may assign \"action plans\" to national governments compelling them to more strictly enforce environmental or labor regulations. The panel would be given jurisdiction over all subnational governments from the Yukon to the Yucatan, including our own state and local governments. If an action plan is not carried out, the panel may impose fines on the offending country of as much as $20 million per offense. The panel also has the power to authorize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions against a country, resulting in not only tariffs but a complete revocation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment benefits. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> subjects the U.S. and Mexico to the same <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions that Canada utterly rejected as an infringement on its autonomy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s complex administrative process would also grant extraordinary power and influence to nongovernmental organizations. The aforementioned Joint Advisory Committee, along with the Evaluation Committees of Experts, would comprise representatives from environmentalist groups and labor-supported organizations, respectively. Their role with the commissions would be to provide \"expert\" advice on regulatory matters, and they would enjoy an unprecedented degree of access to commission proceedings. Nongovernmental organizations would be able to use this privileged position to clamor for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> restrictions, acting as an inside lobby on behalf of domestic industries seeking protection from their competitors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would also impede one of the most important functions of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which is to foster competition among governments for creating more favorable economic conditions. Nations like Mexico, Argentina and Chile have been liberalizing their economies by deregulating overburdened sectors of the economy. Various provisions in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, however, expressly forbid such deregulation. Article 1114, for example, prohibits the relaxation of environmental regulations in order to attract foreign investment. In fact, Article 756 commits the signatories to \"upward harmonization\" of regulations. These provisions will now be vigorously enforced by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s supra-national entities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> should be simple. It should not require endless lobbying, litigation and negotiating. Any country that wants free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must merely abolish its own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, as Mexico has already been doing for several years now. Hopelessly complex <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that restrict free exchange are not repaired by the presence of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rhetoric. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s proponents are inspired more by what they hope it could be than by what it really is.    ---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sheehan is a research associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>\n"}

If this is a negotiating tactic of making extreme demands only to settle for much less and claim victory, maybe it will work. Otherwise Mr. Trump is playing a game of chicken he can't win.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's obsession with undoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> threatens the economy he has so far managed rather well. The roaring stock market, rising GDP and tight job market are signs that deregulation and the promise of tax reform are restoring business and consumer confidence. Blowing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would blow up all that too. It could be the worst economic mistake by a U.S. President since Richard Nixon trashed Bretton-Woods and imposed wage and price controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. demands in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiations--which returned to Washington last week--are growing more bizarre. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer now wants to add a sunset clause, which would automatically kill it in five years unless all three governments agree to keep it. In other words, the U.S. proposes to increase economic uncertainty and raise the incentive for businesses to deploy capital to more reliable investment climates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. also wants to change <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s \"rules of origin\" for autos. Cars now made in North America can cross all three borders duty-free if 62.5% of their content is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-made. Mr. Lighthizer wants to raise that to 85% and add a subclause requiring 50% be made in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lighthizer needs to get out more. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s current rules-of-origin for autos are already the highest of any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement in the world, says John Murphy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Raising them would give car makers an incentive to source components from Asia and pay America's low 2.5% most-favored-nation tariff. A higher-content rule would hurt Mexico, but it won't bring jobs to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Adding a domestic content requirement also would violate World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization rules, so neither Mexico nor Canada are likely to agree. And if they did, it would harm U.S. workers. Auto companies that now make cars for export in the U.S., using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-made components, would simply move abroad more of their manufacturing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to overstate the damage that ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would inflict on the U.S. auto industry. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, companies tap the comparative advantages of all three markets and have created an intricate web of supply chains to maximize returns. As Charles Uthus at the American Automotive Policy Council said last week, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"brings scale, it brings competitiveness, it brings efficiencies [and] synergies between all three countries, and it brings duty-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" Its demise would be \"basically a $10 billion tax on the auto industry in America.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last week the Boston Consulting Group also released a study</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>sponsored by the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association that found ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could mean the loss of 50,000 American jobs in the auto-parts industry as Mexico and Canada revert to pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico has elections next year and no party that bows to unreasonable demands by Mr. Trump can win. The Mexican political class appears willing to call his bluff, which is making American business very nervous. More than 300 state and local chambers of commerce signed an Oct. 10 letter to Mr. Trump imploring him to \"first 'do no harm' in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It noted that 14 million American jobs rely on North American daily <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of more than $3.3 billion. \"The U.S. last year recorded a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus of $11.9 billion with its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners when manufactured goods and services are combined,\" the letter said. \"Among the biggest beneficiaries of this commerce are America's small and medium-sized businesses, 125,000 of which sell their goods and services to Mexico and Canada.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be even more painful for U.S. agriculture, whose exports to Canada and Mexico have quadrupled under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to $38 billion in 2016. Reverting to Mexico's pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariff schedule, duties would rise to 75% on American chicken and high-fructose corn syrup; 45% on turkey, potatoes and various dairy products; and 15% on wheat.

He may also put in a plug for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement his administration is negotiating with 11 PacificRim nations and for fast-track legislation that would limit congressional input in the accord to facilitate its ratification.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If he does both -- bemoan rising inequality and promote yet another free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement -- his speech will rate a chapter in the annals of self-negation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, even the most ossified right-wing economists concede that globalization has played a major role in the loss of American manufacturing jobs and, more broadly, the stagnation of U.S. wages and incomes. Former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder has calculatedthat 22 percent to 29 percent of all U.S. jobs could potentially be offshored. That's a lot of jobs: 25 percent would translate to 36 millionworkers whose wages are in competition with those in largely lower-income nations. Of the 11 nations with which the United States is negotiating the TPP, nine have wage levels significantly lower than ours.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements that promote the relocation of U.S. corporations' factories to nations like China and Mexico have played a central role in the evisceration of American manufacturing and the decline in U.S. workers' incomes. Two out of three displaced manufacturing workers who got new jobs between 2009 and 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports,experienced wage reductions -- most of them greater than 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the most devastating argument against the kind of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords the United States has entered into over the past quarter-century has been that inadvertently made by those defenders of such agreements who have used the 20th anniversary of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- it went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994 -- to celebrate its achievements. I've read many commemorative editorials, columns and speeches in praise of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and not one of them has so much as mentioned the agreement's effect on U.S. employment, wages or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. In October, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who was one of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s architects in the administration of George H.W. Bush, delivered a lengthy, glowing assessment of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s achievements that managed to avoid any of those topics. The champion of avoidance seems to be Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. At a San Diego conference in October, a public radio reporter asked her, \"And where has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> not lived up to some of the hopes and promises?\" Pritzker replied: \"I don't think about where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't lived up.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one statistic in the deal's defense that Pritzker cited in that interview is that the total volume of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> signatories now exceeds $1 trillion a year. What she failed to note, however, is that the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico has risen from $27 billion in 1993, the last pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> year, to $181 billion in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By avoiding discussion of the consequences that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with developing nations have on U.S. workers, not to mention our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance, defenders of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are indulging in the worst kind of imperviousness to facts. But when the case for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is coupled with the case for raising U.S. workers' incomes, it enters a zone where real numbers, and real Americans' lives, matter. In that zone, the argument for the kind of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal embodied by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, permanent normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership completely blows up.

They worsen the very inequality against which the president rightly campaigns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are ways that a developed nation can <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the developing world without gutting its own economy. Germany has been able to protect its workers not only through the advantage of having the euro as its currency, but alsoby requiring its corporations to give their employees a major say in their companies' investment decisions and by embracing a form of capitalism in which shareholders don't play a major role. Were the United States to adopt this form of stakeholder capitalism, then its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords wouldn't necessarily come at the expense of its workers.

His companies have also filed for bankruptcy six times, helping him wriggle out of bills. Given this reputation, it's hardly surprising that vendors and lenders alike ultimately learned it was wiser not to do business with him at all, rather than count on him to keep his word.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised that he'd \"run government like a business,\" and in this respect \u2014 among others \u2014 he has.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Multiple times since taking office, after agreeing to a deal, he has changed his mind at the very last minute. He's done this with \"dreamers,\" China tariffs, a Group of Seven communique, budgets. As Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

To be clear, kicking the can down the road for another seven weeks is not exactly a sign of responsible governance. But if you're a Republican, it seemed shrewd politically. The majorities of both houses of Congress have an interest in looking at least semi-functional. Shutdowns, besides inflicting unnecessary pain on hundreds of thousands of federal workers, are embarrassing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which is why Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decided to endorse this stopgap bill and delay a more substantial funding battle until after Democrats take over the House in the new year. Then at least Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely incoming House speaker, could be scapegoated for any shutdown-related embarrassment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Accordingly, the Senate passed the temporary funding measure, by voice vote, on Dec. 19. The House was expected to vote on it the following day, and the bill was anticipated to sail through with broad support in both parties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Before then, Trump did what he always does: He suddenly changed his mind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Egged on by Fox News and Ann Coulter, he announced he was torpedoing any funding bill \u2014 including this pitiful temporary measure \u2014 unless it included money for his precious border wall. And so outgoing Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) decided not to bring the Senate-passed version of the funding bill to the floor at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's precisely this sort of flip-flopping \u2014 and the cowardly congressional accommodation of said flip-flopping \u2014 that is slowly fraying the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're stuck in an indefinite government shutdown now that Congress has apparently disbanded until after the new year. Maybe the Trump administration will find ways to preserve many of the Obamacare provisions that the public loves, despite refusing to defend them in court; maybe not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 remain in limbo, as do the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico that Trump promised to repeal once a deal was signed. Same with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era arms-control agreement. And so on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump has managed to convince himself, and his base, that he's a brilliant negotiator, smarter than all the experts \u2014 including his Federal Reserve chairman, the many minions tasked with negotiating and renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, his secretaries of state, defense or treasury, or really all of the \"best people\" he has selected to work for him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His gut tells him more than anybody else's brain can ever tell him, he maintains. But his gut seems to have a perpetual case of indigestion, given how often it flips.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real question is why congressional leaders, including Ryan, repeatedly cave to Trump's latest tweets and fleeting fancies instead of writing him off as the flake that he is. Why not at least try to whip the veto-proof votes \u2014 for a budget, really for any piece of legislation \u2014 necessary to simply govern without him?

But it isn't. That argument is neither true of motor vehicles nor of manufactured goods in general.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A study to be released Friday by Anne Flatness and Chris Rasmussen of the Office of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Economic Analysis within the Commerce Department proves its falsity. The study, based on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in Value Added data recently released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, shows that between 1995, the year after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect, and 2011, U.S. content of manufactured goods imported from Canada dropped significantly \u2014 from 21 percent to 15 percent. U.S. content in goods imported from Mexico fell even more \u2014 from 26 percent to 16\u2009percent. The data is available only until 2011, but there is no reason to think that the situation has improved since then.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The numbers for the automobile industry specifically are similar \u2014 not surprising because automobiles account for 27 percent</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>of total imports from Canada and Mexico. Indeed, automobiles drive the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with those countries; the United States would enjoy a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners were it not for the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit in autos and auto parts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These data debunk the claim that U.S. content in the form of parts is so high that we shouldn't worry about headline gross-deficit figures. Nor is this a trivial concern: Canada and Mexico combined are the largest source of manufactured products imported into the United States, accounting for nearly a quarter of our imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This problem is particularly troubling because the previous U.S. share of the content found in imports from Canada and Mexico is largely being absorbed by non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> trading partners, not by Canada and Mexico themselves. The share of content from foreign countries other than Canada and Mexico has almost doubled in our imports from Mexico, from 14 percent to 27 percent. The non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> content of our imports from Canada likewise rose, from 12 percent to 21 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We cannot forget that the point of a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement is to advantage those within the agreement \u2014 not to help outsiders. Instead, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has provided entry into a bigger market for outside countries, and the United States is paying the price. While <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has achieved its goal of increasing three-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in absolute terms, American workers and businesses are not benefiting in a way that is fair and reciprocal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What does this mean for U.S. jobs?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hundreds of thousands of Americans go to work every day in the automobile manufacturing industry. The declining U.S. share of content in imports from Canada and Mexico puts those jobs at risk. The United States accounts for an overwhelming share of the total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> auto market today \u2014 83 percent, in fact \u2014 yet American workers are not reaping the benefits of that purchasing power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, why is this happening?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> included \"rules of origin\" provisions that were intended to restrict the non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> content in final goods. Yet the numbers above show that the opposite has, in fact, happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rules of origin on automobiles listed the exact parts to which the rules of origin applied, and many of those parts are no longer used. Another reason is that the rules include a concept called substantial transformation, which means that if further processing of a non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> item is done by a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partner, the non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> items are \"transformed\" and are deemed to have been produced in the United States, Canada or Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These facts are why U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert E. Lighthizer announced that two major objectives for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are raising the total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> content requirement and raising the U.S. share of that requirement, especially in autos and auto parts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Autos and auto parts are particularly important because our combined <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit in autos and auto parts from Canada and Mexico is $84.6 billion annually, which is the vast majority of our total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in goods deficit with our neighbors. Only $14.6 billion of that deficit is offset by surpluses in other product categories. That is why we have a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> net <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit in goods of $70 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we don't fix the rules of origin, negotiations on the rest of the agreement will fail to meaningfully shift the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalance.

{"id": "421703723.xml", "text": "<h2>GLOBALIZATION; Many Latin Americans Oppose Trade Deal; Critics want a partnership, but a more equitable one.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Porto Alegre, Brazil--In U.S. living rooms, talk about such policy measures as the White House's proposed Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas (FTAA) is likely to elicit clueless shrugs. But south of the Rio Grande, millions of Latin Americans consider FTAA--and U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy in general--to be an immediate issue of life and death urgency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No surprise, then, that as some 40,000 social activists and scholars met here last week to strategize against what they call \"corporate globalization,\" they chose resistance to the FTAA as one of their top priorities. \"We will fight it every possible way and we will defeat it,\" vowed Luis Inacio da Silva, Brazil's most important opposition politician. As head of the left-of-center Workers' Party, which governs large parts of Brazil, Da Silva, or \"Lula\" as he is known to most Brazilians, is currently leading in opinion polls for this October's presidential election. The FTAA, he says, \"isn't really a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact. Rather, it's a policy of annexation of Latin America by the United States.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lula's characterization of the agreement is at sharp odds with that of the Bush administration, which claims that the proposed agreement would help the hemisphere's poor by encouraging a freer flow of goods among all 34 countries stretching between Canada and Argentina. The administration hopes a pact can be approved and implemented by 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, why such a sour view from Lula and other Latin Americans-- the very people President Bush says this agreement would benefit? Critics of the FTAA say it would allow powerful countries like the U.S. to force smaller countries to open their markets, which would then be quickly absorbed. Underdeveloped countries couldn't hope to compete with giants like the U.S., which would, in the end, gobble up an even greater piece of the economic pie.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even some leading free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> defenders concede the same point. Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, chief <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> advisor to the Organization of American States (OAS), acknowledges that, while he remains hopeful, there has been no substantial reduction in Latin American poverty after a decade of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization encouraged by Washington. \"Liberalization was not the miracle or the magic formula that many expected,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Objections to the FTAA center on the same point: the pact would diminish the power of nation-states to regulate their own economies and protect their own citizens. Like the 1994 North Atlantic Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement signed by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the new pact would allow corporations to sue individual governments over any law that might diminish private profit, including legislation that protects consumers, communities, labor and the environment. Already, under Chapter 11 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico has been successfully sued by a U.S. company for trying to protect itself against toxic dumping by blocking the company's expansion plans. And a Canadian firm has sued the U.S., claiming a California anti-air pollution law interferes with profit-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The FTAA would also severely erode controls on foreign investment capital--the same sort of controls that the International Monetary Fund says have been key in providing financial stability in countries ranging from Chile and Colombia to Brazil.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the richest economy in South America and the ninth-biggest in the world, Brazil worries that American corporations would use the FTAA to exploit the abundant resources of the Amazon. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate has become so contentious in Brazil that the recent assassinations of two Workers' Party mayors have been widely interpreted here as an attempt to intimidate Lula and force him to withdraw from the presidential race, thereby silencing a central FTAA critic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But hesitation over FTAA extends beyond Lula's leftist opposition. Recently, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution calling for withdrawal from the current FTAA negotiations with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such opposition also extends into the United States, where there is fear that, as has been the case with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the export of domestic jobs will be greatly accelerated if the FTAA is implemented. Resistance from labor, citizen and environmental groups has been so stiff that, two months ago, when the Bush administration asked for \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" to expedite negotiation of the FTAA, the measure passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote, at a time when Bush was at the height of his post- Sept. 11 popularity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In its desperation to ram this measure through Congress, the White House may have done itself more damage than good. Last-minute backroom deals with wavering members of Congress guaranteed more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection for U.S. agricultural interests--not only contradicting the spirit of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but infuriating major trading partners. A few days after the squeaker House vote, Brazil's moderate President Fernando Henrique Cardoso condemned the protectionist measures.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the months to come, as negotiations on FTAA become more intense, so will resistance and protest. U.S. opponents say they will apply the \"Dracula Strategy\" to defeat the pact. \"The more we expose it to the sunlight of public opinion, the more unpopular it will become,\" says Lori M. Wallach of the nonprofit Public Citizen's Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Watch division.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From Brazil and the rest of Latin America, meanwhile, anti-FTAA campaigners will make it clear they are not flat-Earthers opposed to all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements or to greater economic integration. Rather, they will argue that it is the height of cynicism to contend that treating radically unequal partners equally is somehow fair. These critics want a partnership with the U.S.--but a more equitable one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One model frequently cited as more attractive is that of the European Union. When the EU was being formed, \"compensatory\" measures were enacted so that richer countries--like Germany and France--provided significant development aid as well as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and currency advantages to poorer partners like Greece and Portugal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If President Bush is serious about his promise to help lift Latin Americans out of poverty, he should follow the European example. An FTAA based on the notion that a country like landlocked and impoverished Bolivia can be an equal trading partner with the U.S. will only deepen the hemispheric divide. A more authentic partnership between North and South America would not only establish rules for fair and increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and alleviate the suffocating burden of Southern debt, but would also embody a continental Marshall Plan that would seriously address the currently unsustainable imbalances in education, health care, the environment and human rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there is no evidence to suggest that Bush is serious about his hemispheric anti-poverty promise, which probably means a rocky road ahead. This might be a good moment, then, for average Americans to start brushing up on the alphabet-soup details of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>) and the FTAA. They're likely to be hearing a lot of angry protesting about these issues in the next few months, and they might want to know what all the shouting is about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER: MATT MAHURIN / For The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to The Nation magazine.

But if the 45th president destroys the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement in an attempt to rescue some Americans, millions more -- including many who voted for him -- could be added to the nation's economically forgotten souls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The very red state of Texas could suffer the most. Over 23 years it has worked to adapt to open commerce with its southern neighbor. Production sharing in manufacturing with counterparts across the Mexican border has boosted productivity, and a sharp increase in U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> at Texas land and sea ports has generated big export gains for the Lone Star State.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has made Texas more globally competitive. It hasn't happened without some pain, particularly in border cities. Yet without the agreement, Texas arguably would have found it more difficult, on the employment front, to adjust to the acceleration in manufacturing automation that hit the U.S. during the same period.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump, who was a Democrat for most of his life, uses the metaphor of the forgotten man in much the same way President Franklin Roosevelt did during the 1930s. Both can be viewed as champions of the fellow who has fallen on hard times and cannot seem to recover. The Trumpian approach to helping the \"little guy\" would also be familiar to FDR: Make the economy less free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet as Amity Shlaes explains in her 2007 book, \"The Forgotten Man,\" that term originated with Yale professor William Graham Sumner. In his 1883 essay the forgotten man is the one who is passed the bill -- unnoticed -- when do-gooders propose \"measures of relief for the evils which have caught public attention.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sumner didn't name names. He simply described the injustice of A and B getting together to help X with some new law. C isn't in on the plan but he carries the burden. \"Such is the Forgotten Man,\" Sumner wrote. \"He works, he votes, generally he prays -- but he always pays -- yes, above all, he pays.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mr. Trump's war on globalism, Texas is brimming with Cs -- hard-working Americans who have adjusted to freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and now find that A and B want to change the rules as a favor to X. There are millions more Cs all over the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economist Jesus Canas provides a useful profile of post-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Texas in a 2016 report \"Texas Border Cities Illustrate Benefits and Challenges of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>.\" The report says 710,000 U.S. jobs were lost between 1994 and 2014 \"as a result of increased imports from Mexico and Canada or due to shifts in production.\" Texas, Mr. Canas writes, was the second most-affected state -- in absolute numbers of jobs lost -- behind North Carolina and ahead of California. Texas border cities, where manufacturing had been \"heavily concentrated in low-value-added industries,\" were hit hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet with more competition came increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, investment and technological change, all of which helped reshape the Texas economy. And cities along the border \"went on to gain far more employment than what they lost\" due to changes from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Texas' exports to Mexico -- measured not by where the products are made but by where their journey abroad begins -- increased by 236% from 1994 to 2015. \"A significant share of this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" Mr. Canas writes, \"is in intermediate products -- goods destined for assembly or other processing after which they are imported back into the U.S.\" Mexico is Texas' top export market, taking 40% of what the state sends abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Canas notes that the blue-collar workers most affected by Mexican imports have \"experienced substantially lower wage growth than their counterparts in other industries.\" But he observes that the metropolitan areas that lost the most jobs due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have benefited the most from increases in foreign direct investment. They also benefit from \"rising living standards on the Mexican side of the border,\" i.e., new customers with money.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like the rest of the country, Texas' employment is shifting from manufacturing to \"other sectors such as business services,\" Mr. Canas writes. The state's manufacturing employment is down 9% since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> implementation but manufacturing output grew 4.1% per year between 1997 and 2015.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Manufactured goods exports supported an estimated 990,000 jobs in Texas in 2015,\" the report says. The state \"gained\" more than four million jobs from 1994 to 2015, a period of rising automation and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, while real per capita incomes grew to $47,000 from $30,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's proposal to build new barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico ignores the harm that is sure to come to the armies of American factory workers, entrepreneurs and suppliers of business services who buy and sell across the border.

He may also put in a plug for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement his administration is negotiating with 11 PacificRim nations and for fast-track legislation that would limit congressional input in the accord to facilitate its ratification.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If he does both -- bemoan rising inequality and promote yet another free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement -- his speech will rate a chapter in the annals of self-negation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By now, even the most ossified right-wing economists concede that globalization has played a major role in the loss of American manufacturing jobs and, more broadly, the stagnation of U.S. wages and incomes. Former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder has calculatedthat 22 percent to 29 percent of all U.S. jobs could potentially be offshored. That's a lot of jobs: 25 percent would translate to 36 millionworkers whose wages are in competition with those in largely lower-income nations. Of the 11 nations with which the United States is negotiating the TPP, nine have wage levels significantly lower than ours.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> agreements that promote the relocation of U.S. corporations' factories to nations like China and Mexico have played a central role in the evisceration of American manufacturing and the decline in U.S. workers' incomes. Two out of three displaced manufacturing workers who got new jobs between 2009 and 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports,experienced wage reductions -- most of them greater than 20 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps the most devastating argument against the kind of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords the United States has entered into over the past quarter-century has been that inadvertently made by those defenders of such agreements who have used the 20th anniversary of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- it went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994 -- to celebrate its achievements. I've read many commemorative editorials, columns and speeches in praise of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and not one of them has so much as mentioned the agreement's effect on U.S. employment, wages or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance. In October, former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who was one of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s architects in the administration of George H.W. Bush, delivered a lengthy, glowing assessment of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s achievements that managed to avoid any of those topics. The champion of avoidance seems to be Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. At a San Diego conference in October, a public radio reporter asked her, \"And where has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> not lived up to some of the hopes and promises?\" Pritzker replied: \"I don't think about where <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't lived up.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one statistic in the deal's defense that Pritzker cited in that interview is that the total volume of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> signatories now exceeds $1 trillion a year. What she failed to note, however, is that the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico has risen from $27 billion in 1993, the last pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> year, to $181 billion in 2012.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By avoiding discussion of the consequences that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with developing nations have on U.S. workers, not to mention our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance, defenders of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are indulging in the worst kind of imperviousness to facts. But when the case for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is coupled with the case for raising U.S. workers' incomes, it enters a zone where real numbers, and real Americans' lives, matter. In that zone, the argument for the kind of free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal embodied by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, permanent normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership completely blows up. Such deals increase the incomes of Americans investing abroad even as they diminish the incomes of Americans working at home. They worsen the very inequality against which the president rightly campaigns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are ways that a developed nation can <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the developing world without gutting its own economy. Germany has been able to protect its workers not only through the advantage of having the euro as its currency, but alsoby requiring its corporations to give their employees a major say in their companies' investment decisions and by embracing a form of capitalism in which shareholders don't play a major role. Were the United States to adopt this form of stakeholder capitalism, then its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords wouldn't necessarily come at the expense of its workers. Absent such reforms, however, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals will only negate our attempts to diminish inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>meyersonh@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1985548753.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Courts Economic Mayhem</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump's new National Security Strategy argues that the U.S. must compete in a hostile world. Yet the White House also wants to retreat behind <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. The Trump administration has stacked up a pile of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> cases that will come tumbling down early in 2018. More important than any specific case is the signal of a strategy of economic defeatism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is ready to block steel and aluminum imports through a rarely used \"national security\" rationalization. As an alternative, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had tried negotiating capacity cuts in Chinese production, but Mr. Trump waved him off with a demand for tariffs. Because most of China's metal exports already face U.S. tariffs of more than 80%, Mr. Trump's tactic will likely trigger retaliation from other countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Next up are \"safeguards\" to block imports of solar panels and washing machines. Imposing \"safeguards\" doesn't even require a claim of unfairness. On top of this, last year (through Sept. 20) the Commerce Department conducted 65 investigations of alleged low-cost or subsidized imports. That figure is a 16-year high, up 50% from the year before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But these amount to an overture to the big show: likely withdrawal from the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement or both. The continuing negotiations to \"fix\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are doomed. Mexico and Canada would probably agree on eliminating barriers and setting new rules for the digital age. But Mr. Trump's real aim is to dictate market outcomes. The administration wants to start with the goal of eliminating the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and then manipulate rules to that end. It wants the U.S. to be excused from keeping its side of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bargain. It wants a five-year sunset clause.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's National Security Strategy covered every region except North America, our home continent and base for projecting power. The administration gives the bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico precedence over areas where our interests align: Asian competition, border security and energy security. Moreover, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals cannot change the economic fundamentals that determine the balance. Mexico and Canada cannot agree to managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or any deal that lets Washington ignore the rules when it chooses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president is trying to placate his political base, which will be enraged if he accepts a deal on \"Dreamer\" immigrants and fails to build his promised border wall. He relies on the support of economic isolationists who find it easier to blame others than to make America more competitive. Killing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would fit the bill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump does not know how to use bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations to create pressure for stronger multilateral rules. The U.S. has historically used bilateral deals not only to eliminate tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers but also to set higher standards for services, agricultural products, intellectual-property protection and more. Such deals have added environmental and labor protections, while boosting anticorruption and transparency rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has used <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to expand the circle of like-minded nations. The Trans-Pacific Partnership included six countries with which the U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, and added five more. That offered leverage with China, but Mr. Trump abandoned the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No country wants to do a bilateral deal with Mr. Trump now because he demands managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, not fair competition. He wants excuses to raise barriers, not rules to boost <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. That's why Mr. Trump will use his indictment of China's intellectual-property practices to justify more protectionism, not solve the problems. During the president's recent trip to China, when Beijing proposed opening some of its financial markets to U.S. companies, the Trump team dismissed this as the old way of doing business. The new way is to block Chinese exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some in Congress, with Mr. Trump's backing, want to establish a new technology-control regime under the rubric of screening foreign investment. But government reviews of \"covered transactions\" could apply to countless business deals with foreigners -- licensing, joint development, hiring -- far beyond those involving China. The U.S. already has the authority to block investments and regulate the transfer of technology. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. reviews 200 or so deals a year. Expanding that to many thousands would harm America's competitiveness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are all signs of an America in withdrawal, not one confidently pressing the world to adopt new rules of fair competition and technology security. Farmers and ranchers are fretting that the retaliation triggered by a Fortress America <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy will leave them behind a closed door. Companies that rely on sophisticated supply chains, such as auto makers, will pay a high price.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is abandoning the challenge of setting new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> standards, whether for data, e-commerce or transnational services. America once attracted the world's talent, but Mr. Trump's hostility is driving people away. If he pulls the U.S. out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, even financial markets might recognize that his economic isolationism poses a risk to growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True competitors honestly assess their weaknesses, adapt and then grow stronger. Those are the qualities that made America great. This will be the year that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy could define Trump's fearful America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Zoellick is a former World Bank president, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative and deputy secretary of state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Robert B.

{"id": "421181421.xml", "text": "<h2>This Bridge Is Going Nowhere; An expanded NAFTA will be fought unless worker rights, environment are negotiated.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TWith Washington consumed by the metastasizing money scandal, President Clinton is about to turn to the world stage to change the subject of public attention. After summiting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, he will revisit what he calls the major foreign policy victory of his first term: the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Accord. The President is poised to ask Congress for \"fast track\" authority to negotiate Chile's entry into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a prelude to a hemispheric agreement on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The president then will make a \"historic state visit\" to Mexico on April 11.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But this turn to foreign policy is likely to bring the president more grief than relief. Mexico is a catastrophe, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> an embarrassment. A push for \"fast track\" will earn the president wide editorial approval but pit him against the base of his own party and the majority of the American people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A satirist would be hard pressed to invent a greater foreign policy debacle than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement with Mexico. Virtually every fact mustered by the administration to get the deal through Congress has been revealed as fiction, every promise broken, every prediction proven wrong. The Mexican administration that was touted as a bastion of Harvard-educated democrats turned out to be corrupt and financially incompetent, its president shamed into exile. The small U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico became a $16-billion-a-year deficit. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 251,000 U.S. workers lost their jobs in the bargain. U.S. manufacturers routinely use the threat of moving to Mexico as a club against workers in wage negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mexico, the catastrophe knows no bounds. The U.S. bailed out speculators when the peso collapsed, but not the Mexican people. More than 1 million were thrown out of work. The middle class has been crushed. Real wages have sunk by about one-third. The proliferating companies exporting to the U.S. advertise jobs at 91 cents an hour, a fraction of pay levels in 1980. Poisonous environmental conditions on the border have gotten worse. Illegal migrants pour across as hundreds of thousands of peasants displaced from their land head north. Drugs are Mexico's largest export, and the corruption of Mexican authorities is rampant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration would like to dismiss all this. It has certified Mexico as cooperating in the drug war. Two-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is up, apologists argue. Deficits don't matter. Mexico has repaid its debt to the U.S. (by borrowing more from the Europeans).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president doesn't want to argue about the past but about the future. The global marketplace is a reality and \"the U.S. must lead.\" Surely he is right about that, but it opens that obvious question: Where is the U.S. leading? The reality of the global market--and the record profits of U.S. multinationals and stagnant wages of U.S. workers--have transformed the debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The argument isn't about the catastrophe in Mexico, although that erodes the credibility of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosters. The question is whether the U.S. will take the lead in the hard work of building sensible rules to govern the global market. Here the administration's default has been one of historic proportions. It has exerted itself mightily to protect the rights of multinational corporations, but has been essentially absent without leave in the argument over worker rights or environmental protections.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, the major opposition to \"fast track\" authority will come not from the protectionist fulminations of Pat Buchanan, but from progressives--liberal internationalists, human rights activists, environmentalists, citizen groups, union leaders and a growing portion of the public. The opposition is not arguing to shut down <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but to outlaw child labor; not for building walls but for protecting rain forests. It wants the administration to fight for worker rights as hard as it fights for property rights. It will demand that enforceable labor rights and environmental protections be part of any fast track treaty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With Newt Gingrich announcing that Republicans will oppose any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that requires protection of people and not just property, the president may find his bipartisan \"vital center\" on the wrong side of a historic struggle. He also will find <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> no exit from the financial scandals enveloping Washington. The vast majority of large donors to both parties are ardent supporters of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. A recent Bank of Boston poll shows overwhelming voter support for building labor rights into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords. The White House and the legislators will have choose between the interests of those who pay for their parties and the concerns of those who vote for them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead of changing the subject, the president may end up getting voters more concerned about who is buying what in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Robert L.

{"id": "2063571138.xml", "text": "<h2>In Trump's game, everyone loses</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ever since it ended, a steady drip of gossip has circulated about last month's disastrous Group of Seven summit. By all accounts, President Trump behaved far worse behind the scenes than he did in public.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was the gratuitous rudeness, including the moment he threw two Starburst candies onto a table and said</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>to the German chancellor, \"Here, Angela. Don't say I never gave you anything.\" There was aggression, as well as ignorance: \"NATO is as bad as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it's much too costly for the U.S.,\" he said at one point; to others he mentioned NATO, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the European Union collectively, throwing them together as organizations he dislikes. Later, he added a twist: \"The European Union was set up to take advantage of the United States.\" Those comments have inspired the resignation of the U.S. ambassador to Estonia, a career diplomat, who has called them \"factually wrong,\" as well as proof that \"it's time to go.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is the background that you need to understand the emotions around the next NATO summit on July 11 and 12, as well as the Trump-Vladimir Putin meeting on July 16. For the first time since 1945, Europe is grappling with an American president who has a fundamentally different view of America's international role. Trump doesn't want the United States to be the West's central organizing force. He doesn't care about the benefits that role has brought, if he even understands them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's dislike of U.S. allies is now shaping into a clear policy: Europeans are bracing for a United States that no longer considers security and defense organizations special and inviolable. Instead, Trump sees the U.S. commitments to all the institutions he despises as bargaining chips, and he is prepared to use U.S. troops in Europe to force Europeans to make concessions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and other things. He may use his meeting with Putin for the same purpose: to intimidate the British, the Germans and others worried by aggressive Russian behavior, and to force them to do what he wants, in whatever sphere he happens to care about. Everything is up for grabs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This new attitude has already had one very minor, little-noticed effect: The radical-right Polish government last week unexpectedly rushed through amendments to a law it had passed curtailing public debate about the Holocaust. For months, the government wasted political capital defending this ludicrous law, which was particularly offensive to the Israelis, not to mention many Poles. But in the run-up to the NATO summit, the Polish leadership is terrified that U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Poland; Polish leaders know Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is close to Trump, and they don't want to give the White House any excuses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a price this Polish government is willing to pay (and it's notable that the White House does not seem to demand that this same government halt its ongoing assault on the independent judiciary). But what about others? Not everybody will be asked for such a small, essentially cosmetic sacrifice. Perhaps the Germans will be asked to destroy their car industry in exchange for keeping U.S. troops in Heidelberg. Perhaps the British will be told to bankrupt their farmers in exchange for promises of joint maneuvers. As for smaller countries - Estonia, Lithuania - they are out of luck: They haven't got many chips to bargain with in this new poker game, and they can be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d away to Putin - if he wants them - at low cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The bigger question, of course, is what price U.S. voters are willing to pay for accepting these new rules. Here's one possible consequence: If it becomes clear that America no longer supports NATO's security guarantee - or supports it for some countries and not others - then does the alliance have any value at all? Maybe the whole thing comes crashing down, NATO becomes worthless, and America finds itself all alone at the poker table. Without its European bases, the United States ceases to be a force in Eurasia. The U.S. military will have trouble projecting military power into the Middle East or Africa. Perhaps Russia or China replaces the United States as the dominant power, particularly if the E.U. collapses - and then they set the trading rules. Is that what we want?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other risk is that the coming <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars take a toll, and not just on Harley- Davidson. U.S. multinationals are by far the biggest beneficiaries of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> arrangements around the world. If U.S. markets are no longer open to European companies, then why should Europe be open to Amazon, Facebook and General Motors? Europeans might decide to impose new tariffs and taxes - or use antitrust legislation to try to break up big U.S. corporations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have always been downsides to the American-led international order, for everybody. It was a series of negotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-offs: You win some, you lose some. Mostly, America won. There was a reason successive American administrations supported the WTO, NATO, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the E.U.: These organizations were the basis for American military power, as well as for American wealth and prosperity. If Trump destroys the trust upon which this system was based, it may never be revived. Europe may be poorer and more unstable as a result. But so will the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>applebaumletters@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Anne Applebaum</p>\n"}

Yes, that increases demand. (Score one for Schniepp.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result there is increased pressure on farmers to convert their land, particularly in light of competition from foreign producers with cheaper labor, fewer pesticide regulations and questionable inspection procedures. (Think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and malathion.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schniepp offers a simplistic economic view of the world using purely black and white numbers and trying to distill many quality-of-life issues into simple quantitative formulas. He's correct that restrictions on the supply of land coupled with increased population demand leads to higher housing prices that may force some economic groups out of the market. So, what's new? That's Economics 101!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The diatribe by Postrel supporting \"flat\" rather than \"tall\" solutions to urban settlement problems is equally lacking. Postrel blathers on about a \"neo-traditional conspiracy\" that is determined to put everybody into living conditions like San Francisco. (This writer happens to think San Francisco is one of the top cities in the world. But San Francisco can't happen everywhere because climate and terrain can't be imitated.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The neo-traditional / new urbanist movement is simply saying that a lot of today's ills are visited upon us because we have chosen to sprawl. Sprawl does lead to jobs following housing in some instances (see \"Edge Cities\" by Joel Garreau), which has led to deteriorating downtowns. Sprawl has forced longer commutes for some people seeking affordable homes, and also separated them from basic services, leaving them dependent on autos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cookie-cutter tract homes with garages as the dominant feature (\"garages with attached houses\" as former Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole puts it) are primarily designed to serve the automobile rather than human needs. This has led to people feeling disengaged from their neighbors and without a sense of community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new urbanists are not saying that more compact development is for everyone. They are saying that builders, until recently, have not been willing to develop that type of product (more precisely, lenders haven't been willing to lend for it). They are also saying that alternative types of housing should be offered. And the purchasers of those new products seem to be fairly happy with them (so says the Real Estate lead story \"Inside Tracts\").</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One way to save farmland is to efficiently use the areas that are already developed. (Back to SOAR.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Schniepp always fails to take into account quality of life--an intangible factor for economists. And yet, that's what much of this discussion is about. SOAR was a reaction to concerns about a deteriorating quality of life, real or perceived. Instead of viewing SOAR as only a negative movement, we could take advantage of it to reevaluate how humans can better interact with the natural landscape.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Humans are a strange species. Our lives are full of dichotomies. We rail against high density. We rail against longer commutes, crowded streets, lack of good-paying jobs, no time for our families and pesticide use near our homes. We say we want to slow down, become members of a community, care for our elders and enjoy the natural environment. Yet we chase the good-paying job, love our cars, want cheaper housing and don't like change.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Everything is interrelated. Nothing in life is without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-offs. Sure, there are problems but there are also solutions--be it trading malathion for more benign borax so farming can continue close to urban uses; in-filling underutilized areas or helping U.S. farmers compete with imports by paying slightly higher prices for better quality produce.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Life happens on an incremental basis. Decisions about where to live, eat, work happen daily. Choose wisely. The quality of life you save may be your own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: Carl Morehouse</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Carl Morehouse is a Ventura resident and professional land-use planner and past director of the Central Coast section of the American Planning Assn</p>\n"}

But do we really want America to be known for spreading the pricing practices of our drug companies?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Guatemala, the United States has become the sales rep for the pharmaceutical industry. Citing urgent public health concerns, the Guatemalan legislature enacted a law last year that permitted the marketing of generic drugs alongside their brand-name equivalents. Citing the Central America Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (CAFTA), whose ratification congressional committees will begin to consider next week, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative then told the Guatemalans that any such drug legislation would stop CAFTA dead in its tracks. If the five Central American nations (plus the Dominican Republic) that had signed CAFTA wanted it ratified, Guatemala would have to repeal the new law. Reluctantly, Guatemala obliged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though the rules laid down by the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization permit generic competition, CAFTA imposes a five -to-10 year waiting period on generic competitors, unless they conduct their own time-and- money-consuming clinical trials for the very same drugs that have already passed such trials. CAFTA thus effectively ensures the drug companies an extension of their monopoly on high-priced medications. It also ensures that thousands of Central Americans in need of such medications will have to go without.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is just one of a number of cautionary tales illustrating the fundamental reality of most of our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords: They are designed to maximize corporate profits no matter the cost to the peoples of the signatory nations. Consider our experience with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, after which CAFTA is modeled. In the 12 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was ratified, the yearly U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico and Canada has grown from $9.1 billion to $110.8 billion. Yet, while close to a million jobs have been lost in the United States, it's not as if that money is flowing into Mexicans' pockets. Since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was enacted, real wages for Mexicans have declined, the nation's poverty rate has increased, and illegal immigration to the United States has soared. For both Mexican and American workers, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a lose-lose proposition. For the U.S corporations that have outsourced their work to Mexico, though, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a clear profit center.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now comes CAFTA, which promises Central American workers the same kind of raw deal. CAFTA would actually weaken the not very formidable labor standards that currently exist in the Central American nations. Under the current Generalized System of Preferences, those nations are required to take steps \"to afford internationally recognized worker rights.\" Should CAFTA pass, the nations will be required only to enforce their own worker- protection laws, which they'd be perfectly free to repeal. That's the primary reason why the major union federations in Central America have joined the AFL-CIO in opposing CAFTA's ratification.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Labor is not alone in its opposition to CAFTA. For years, the issue of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has divided the Democratic Party. But the experience with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and now the concentration of global manufacturing in China seem to have awakened virtually every Democrat in the House to the perils of a new economic order based on the protection and promotion of cheap labor. In 2002, 21 House Democrats supported the administration's fast-track legislation. This year the estimate of the number of Democratic congressmen who will back CAFTA is no higher than 10. That's partly because Republicans have defeated such Democratic free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> champions as Charles Stenholm, who lost his seat in Tom DeLay's great Texas Demo-cidal district redrawing. But it's also because Democrats have finally realized the futility of supporting labor and environmental protections domestically, only to see them threatened, and American jobs eliminated, by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords that eviscerate such standards internationally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That means that Republicans will have to be unified in order to pass CAFTA, and by all indications, they're anything but. As was not the case with previous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords, agricultural interests are lining up against CAFTA, a change that Republicans from rural districts have duly noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> debates, finally, are concerned with the emerging global order; our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies are as clear an expression of our global vision as our foreign policy. For those who see America's mission as enforcing the drug companies' profit margins, CAFTA is the treaty for you.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>meyersonh@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "398899150.xml", "text": "<h2>The Skinny on Cafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The legislative battle over the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is heating up, and if we are to believe the grandiose claims put forward by Cafta's supporters, this deal will create great jobs at home, close our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, lift Central America out of poverty, and solidify democratic reforms there. It will also boost global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks and allow supporters to paint themselves as \"pro-growth\" and \"pro-jobs.\" Wow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we've heard these arguments before: 11 years ago, when Congress debated the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement; 10 years ago, with the ratification of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization agreement; and five years ago, when China joined the WTO. In each instance, the American people were told the deals would open markets abroad, improve U.S. competitiveness, spur jobs and growth, and eradicate poverty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It didn't work then and it won't work now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, proponents argued that with the American market already more open to Mexican products, our workers and producers would come out on top if all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers were eliminated. But since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was implemented, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico has increased 1,200%, from $9 billion in 1993 to $111 billion in 2004. Imports from our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners grew more than $100 billion faster than our exports to them, displacing almost one million decent-paying jobs here at home, in industries as diverse as aircraft, autos, apparel, and consumer electronics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, real wages in Mexico have fallen, the number of poor people has grown, and illegal immigration flows have doubled. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> liberalization in agriculture displaced nearly a million rural small farmers, swamping the fewer jobs created in the export processing sectors. Many in Mexico who supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 11 years ago have turned into ardent opponents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ratification of the WTO and the grant of permanent normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations (PNTR) to China involved similarly spurious arguments. Ten years into the WTO, our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit is at a record-smashing $617 billion, close to an unsustainable 6% of GDP. And just three years after China's accession to the WTO, our bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit has about doubled, to $162 billion. These <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals have not, by themselves, caused the ballooning of our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalance, but they sure haven't improved it, as advertised.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor have the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals improved our competitive edge in key sectors. In traditionally strong areas -- services, high tech and agriculture -- our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances are eroding dramatically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's face it, there is something wrong with this \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" model. It simply fails to deliver good jobs and rising wages at home, or real development abroad. Meanwhile, intrusive limits on government's capacity to regulate in the public interest lurk in the investment, services, and government procurement chapters of these deals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is time for us to take a closer look at the actual content of these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements and ask: \"Is this the best we can do?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta extends a failed model. We should all understand by now that modern (post-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements are not just about lowering tariffs. They are about changing the conditions attached to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization, in ways that benefit some players and hurt others. These are not your textbook free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. These are finely orchestrated special-interest deals that boost the profits and power of multinational corporations, leaving workers, family farmers, many small businesses, and the environment more vulnerable than ever.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lopsided tilt toward corporate interests helps to explain why Cafta is so unpopular, both here at home and throughout Central America. A recent poll by Americans for Fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> found widespread opposition to Cafta, with 74% of respondents saying they would oppose the pact if it caused job losses, even if it also reduced consumer prices. In Central America, tens of thousands of workers, farmers, small-business owners, and other activists have taken to the streets to voice their vehement opposition to the deal and to the lack of transparency in the negotiation process.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta strengthens protections for multinational corporations, forcing draconian changes in intellectual property protection regimes, giving corporations new rights to sue governments over regulations they deem too costly or inconvenient, and limiting the ability of future legislators to place conditions on government procurement. This hurts Central America's prospects for future development, just as it weakens state legislators and erodes wages and jobs here at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Guatemalan Bishop Monsignor Alvaro Ramazzini said in a statement issued on March 10, \"Cafta is much more than a simple <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement, as it includes a range of mechanisms that combine prohibitions on governments with rights for foreign investors on such issues as investment, national treatment, intellectual-property rights, market access, public services and access to bidding on public contracts. If implemented, Cafta will transfer privileges for corporations into rights.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, Cafta actually weakens the minimal workers' rights conditions we have in place today, under existing preference programs like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Instead of insisting that Central American governments must respect internationally recognized workers' rights, the Bush administration has negotiated provisions requiring only the enforcement of domestic labor laws. There is nothing in the agreement that would prevent governments from gutting or even eliminating their labor laws after signing the agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American and Central American unions have come together to oppose Cafta and to lay out our alternative vision for a system designed to eliminate social and economic inequities. A fair system must provide for, among other things, workers' rights, clear anti-corruption policies, fair environmental and agricultural rules, and debt-relief.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Bush administration bungled an opportunity to negotiate a decent deal with Central America, one that would balance diverse interests and promote genuine development and reciprocal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The deal now being offered to Congress represents a setback on workers' rights and development prospects. For the sake of America's working families and our counterparts in Central America, Congress should reject it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Lee is the chief international economist at the AFL-CIO.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Cafta: Good for the Goose, The Gander, and Everyone\" -- WSJ April 13, 2005)</p>\n"}

He negotiated 27 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> treaties that were the basis, after World War II, for the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> (GATT) and the greatest economic boom in history.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's Hull is . . . Mickey Kantor? The new U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rep is a certified friend-of-Bill, but so far he qualifies only as a statesman manque. Last week Mr. Kantor told Congress that new side deals on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement wouldn't include enforcement powers. Anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> forces howled. This week Mr. Kantor said those deals must come \"with teeth.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So which is it? \"You can't ask me to reconcile the two,\" says Mr. Kantor's spokeswoman, who deserves a raise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Over the weekend he got some dentures,\" quips one Capitol Hill Democrat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So goes the Clinton <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, if that's the word for it. While our president gives fine speeches about \"open and competitive commerce,\" his team's behavior is giving everyone else headaches. \"If there ever was a time that cried out for U.S. leadership, it is now when we're the only major country that's growing, and instead we're playing the role of the aggrieved party, claiming we're the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> victims,\" says Ted Van Dyk, a Democrat from the party's old free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> school. Consider:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Mr. Clinton has blown a chance to wrap up the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-opening GATT talks. In George Bush's last days, Europe finally squeezed farm concessions from the ornery French. Advice streamed into the Clinton transition to take the deal, declare victory and refer catcalls to Mr. Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the White House bowed to private complainers and vowed to reinvent the deal. It stiffed Leon Brittan, Europe's chief negotiator, on his recent visit here. Meanwhile, the \"fast-track\" process for getting the treaty through Congress has expired; it may not be renewed until next fall, if ever. Mercantilists -- who want state power to serve commercial ends -- are ecstatic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- The White House says it wants <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> but has no strategy for getting it through Congress. Its marketing whizzes can sell a tax increase to the middle class, but apparently not a treaty that would create jobs and keep Mexico growing and stable. If a vote were taken today, Democrats would repudiate their own president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Mr. Kantor may cashier a study of the punitive effects of U.S. laws against \"dumping\" foreign goods. The study, requested in her last days by Bush <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rep Carla Hills, is timely because this tool of U.S. protectionists is now being used by others to block U.S. goods. But the study is being resisted by the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This drift reflects the emerging Clinton method of viewing all policy through the prism of transactional politics. In this view, the U.S. has no special responsibility to lead an open global trading system. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is less about a principle than about making a political deal. \"This is a process, not a philosophy,\" Mr. Kantor told the National Journal, revealingly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A lawyer/lobbyist, Mr. Kantor personifies this approach. He made sure his first official visit was to the AFL-CIO. On Capitol Hill his mentor is Dick Gephardt, who so fears Japanese mercantilism that he wants us to imitate it. Mr. Kantor welcomed Mexico's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> minister, Jaime Serra Puche, to their first meeting by showing a letter from Mr. Gephardt and saying they had no business to discuss until his concern was met. (It was.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kantor's idea of promoting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is now to assert that the U.S. will \"walk away from the table\" if it isn't changed to the liking of Democratic critics. Perhaps this shows negotiating genius that others are too dull to see. More likely, it's a transparent attempt to appease <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> critics (Ralph Nader) who are unappeasable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is also a remarkable attempt to impose U.S. domestic law onto a sovereign nation. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> policy was once about such quaint matters as tariffs; now it is supposed to include social welfare and air quality.

Secretary of State Warren Christopher seems to think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a domestic issue. Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, preaches the virtues of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> retaliation. She misunderstands that the Bush threat of retaliation -- against Europe in November -- was a laser shot to prod France to make progress on GATT. Treasury may be the only open-market voice on the Clinton team.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton's instincts aren't mercantilist. But the danger of his muddled <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is that it will slouch toward mercantilism by degrees; that GATT will die of inattention; that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be overrun by demagogues; that the targets of Ms. Tyson's \"strategic\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> punches will punch right back.

President Clinton is touring South America to promote expansion of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment, but rules guiding those activities make it impossible for countries to manage their resources sustainably.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Protections for forests in the three North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement countries -- Canada, Mexico and the United States -- have been rolled back by measures designed to boost competitiveness. Expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to the Amazon will insure destruction of the planet's most important reservoir of biological diversity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, President Clinton's proposed fast-track rules prohibit our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators from getting what even pitiful protections for labor and the environment they got under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cattle ranching, which has encouraged destruction of the rain forest, will skyrocket as the United States grants new market access for Brazilian beef.

{"id": "2160683417.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Broken Nafta Promise</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Trump signed his new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> accord last month with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau almost didn't show up. The reason: Mr. Trump still hasn't lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs as he promised he'd do if America's two neighbors signed a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A month later they're still waiting. The delay is damaging the U.S. economy and America's credibility as a trading partner. Though Mr. Trump likes to use tariff threats as a negotiating tactic, his Administration also promised relief from the levies he imposed under Section 232 of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Congress in June that the \"objective\" of the metals tariffs \"is to have a revitalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that helps America and, as part of that, the 232s would logically go away, both as it relates to Canada and as to Mexico.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In July U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer told a Senate hearing that \"resolving the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> issue -- we would expect, or hope, that we would resolve the steel and the aluminum issues with both Mexico and Canada.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last March no less than the President himself tweeted that \"tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> agreement is signed.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet U.S. officials now say signing new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn't enough. They also want Canada and Mexico to agree to new quotas on their metals exports to the U.S. before the U.S. will lift the Section 232 tariffs. This is politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that responds to lobbying in Washington, not free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that responds to market supply and demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel to the U.S., with a 20% import share, so the goal of quotas would be to limit steel supply to keep prices in the U.S. high. Canada and Mexico are understandably resisting since they thought a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would mean the end of arbitrary tariffs imposed in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, American steel consumers continue to suffer from the tariffs. One loser is the American beer industry, which says the tariffs amount to a $347 million tax on U.S. brewers. Beer Institute President Jim McGreevy says U.S. brewers used more than 36 billion aluminum bottles and cans last year and the tariffs \"could cost the beer industry more than 20,000 jobs.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hundreds of American metal fabricators are also finding it difficult to acquire the steel to compete with foreign producers. Riverdale Mills Corp., in Northbridge, Mass., makes \"aquamesh,\" a marine wire-mesh used in 85% of lobster traps made in North America. The company is the largest global supplier for lobster fishermen and makes 95% of the wire mesh used for oyster cultivation. It exports 45% of what it makes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Riverdale needs specialty steel, which CEO James Knott says the company would like to buy in the U.S. But suppliers often can't make the high-quality grade he needs and his steel prices have doubled since January. He's losing market share at home and abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"My foreign competitors are buying steel at half the price I'm paying, and some of them face no tariffs when [exporting] to the U.S,\" he says. The company has received some exclusions, but they account for less than 3% of their steel purchases. Mr. Knott says he's cut his workforce to 150 from 200.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>New <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opens a slightly larger share of the Canadian dairy market to U.S. producers. But Mexico is the largest destination for U.S. dairy exports, and American dairy farmers are getting hammered by the 25% tariff that Mexico imposed on U.S. dairy products in retaliation for the steel and aluminum tariffs. The marginal gain in Canada may not make up for the export losses to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We're not ready to celebrate,\" CEO David Ahlem of Hilmar Cheese Co., based in Hilmar, Calif., said when new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was announced in October. \"As long as 232 retaliatory tariffs are still in place . . . we can't enjoy the benefits of having a modernized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and be back to where we were.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's broken <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> promise will make it harder to negotiate new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Europe and Asia. Other countries worry that even if they sign a new deal, Mr. Trump or some future U.S. President will roll out 232 tariffs any time there's domestic political pressure. Congress intended 232 to be used for \"national security\" emergencies, not as an all-purpose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> weapon. Mr. Trump's tariff trickery with Mexico and Canada is one more reason Congress should restrict his 232 license.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}
{"id": "2115077957.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA 2.0, with a splash of TPP</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, that was unnecessarily painful.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After spending a year and a half alienating our friends, punishing our farmers and manufacturers with devastating tariffs and counter-tariffs, and fracturing the hard-won alliance we had built to isolate and pressure China, we finally got a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal - and a \"new\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet somehow, they look an awful lot like the old ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sunday evening, news broke that Canada agreed to the terms of a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Not merely renegotiated: rebranded! What was once the easily pronounceable \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" will hereafter be the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or \"USMCA.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the name change was needed is a little unclear. Our marketer in chief clearly loves rebranding things, and USMCA, while it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does have the virtue of literally putting America first. Oddly, the posted text of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact itself still repeatedly refers to itself as \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2018.\" I guess someone forgot to search-and-replace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to the substance, well, the best you can say is it could have been a whole lot worse. President Trump didn't, as he threatened, blow up the system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, you know, whoop de doo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some new protectionist measures, such as complicated new requirements for auto rules of origin, which could potentially backfire. That is, they may end up being so costly to adhere to that they'll encourage manufacturers to move more of their operations and jobs outside of North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other stuff, such as a \"sunset\" provision requiring members to regularly reaffirm their desire to continue the three-party deal, is probably also not an improvement. There are better ways to encourage ongoing modernization of the deal that would involve less policy uncertainty for businesses. But, again, this section is not as bad as many businesses and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also won some modest concessions in tiny industries he's weirdly obsessed with, such as Canadian dairy. He has conveniently played down the concessions he made in exchange: In return for greater American access to the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg markets, we gave Canada greater access to U.S. markets for dairy, peanuts, processed peanut products, sugar and sugar-containing products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the most part, despite Trump's assertion that \"it's not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> redone, it's a brand-new deal,\" the president mostly kept <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> intact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, some of the more significant changes - relating to issues such as labor standards, environmental protections and e-commerce - appear to be cribbed from another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that Trump has demonized: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you (like me) supported TPP, this is either reassuring or supremely frustrating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Barack Obama negotiated TPP - a 12-party pact that included Canada and Mexico - as part of his own promise to \"renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" TPP was also Obama's strategy for keeping China from writing \"the rules of the road\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. China was deliberately excluded from the pact, which was designed to cement a coalition of countries that had been wounded by China's misbehavior. Working together, these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> victims hoped to pressure China to reform.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's first orders of business as president, of course, was to pull out of TPP. He soon thereafter picked unnecessary <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fights with TPP countries we'd previously tried to make common cause with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Trump seems to have realized his mistake. Despite how he characterizes his \"historic transaction,\" the USMCA is mostly just a smooshing together of two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that he derided as the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals ever made, as Dartmouth Tuck School of Business professor Emily Blanchard points out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, a bunch of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 language appears squarely aimed at returning to Obama's alliance strategy for isolating China - which, to reiterate, only requires rebuilding because Trump destroyed it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>- replacement deal includes \"protections against misappropriation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets, including by state-owned enterprises,\" one of China's major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sins. Likewise, there's also language designed to disincentivize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 signatories from making free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with \"non-market\" countries, widely understood to be targeting China. Some have speculated that Trump may press for similar language in negotiations with other countries, such as Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, Trump has wrought a lot of destruction in service of landing us in roughly the same position we would have been in had we simply stayed in TPP and pursued more amicable negotiations with Mexico and Canada on other outstanding issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of these harms - such as the steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures that, despite Sunday's announcement, remain on the books - may yet be reversible. But the damage to our reputation as a reliable trading partner and ally may be irreparable. To Trump, that may be a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Catherine Rampell</p>\n"}
{"id": "419944019.xml", "text": "<h2>One more time: Gephardt revives a losing strategy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) has a theory of how to become president. It starts with being the most protectionist candidate in the Democratic field, which he hopes will lead to his endorsement by the AFL-CIO, lifting him to victory in the primaries and the general election. But if it were such a great plan, Gephardt wouldn't be running. He'd be writing his presidential memoirs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He tried this approach in 1988, campaigning on a bill to punish countries that ran <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses with the United States. But after winning in Iowa, with the advantage of being from neighboring Missouri, he soon fell out of contention. The guy who beat him in the Democratic primaries, Michael Dukakis, was strongly in favor of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. So was the guy who beat Dukakis in November, George Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In presidential politics, the only thing worse than not getting the AFL-CIO's endorsement is getting it. The last two candidates to get its blessing early in the race were Walter Mondale and Al Gore, neither of whom spent the following four years being serenaded with \"Hail to the Chief.\" Bill Clinton won even though the labor organization didn't get behind him until he already had the 1992 nomination sewn up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The support of organized labor would be nicer if it didn't force a candidate to take positions that alienate so many other Americans. Gephardt has already gotten the endorsement of both the Teamsters and the United Steelworkers. But pandering to labor, though it may help him now, will probably doom him once actual voters get involved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The AFL-CIO endorsement wasn't enough to save Mondale in 1984, when union members made up 19 percent of all workers. Since then, organized labor's share has shrunk to 13 percent of all employees-- and just 9 percent in the private sector. Gephardt, who brags that he has been fighting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for 20 years, is offering top dollar for a dwindling asset.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mondale lost partly because he was perceived, fairly or not, as the slavishly obedient son of Democratic special interests. Gephardt makes Mondale look like the soul of independence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is a make-or-break issue with unions, which regard imported goods the way Californians regard earthquakes. Most Americans, however, don't share that fear. To the contrary, they like being able to buy a range of economical products from all over the world, and they understand that foreign competition makes American companies more efficient and more attentive to consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, protectionist appeals usually fizzle at the polls. In 1988, Bob Dole thought he could beat George Bush in the South Carolina primary by denouncing textile imports, which competed with South Carolina companies. But locals apparently didn't care that much about South Carolina's fabric industry: They preferred Bush by more than 2-to-1. It turns out the state has a lot more people who buy textile products than people who make them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>-bashing was supposed to be a winner in 1992, thanks to a weak economy. It didn't turn out that way. Nebraska Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey got nothing out of a campaign ad in which he stood in front of a hockey net threatening to keep out Japanese imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the Republican side, veteran xenophobe Pat Buchanan gave President Bush a scare in New Hampshire, but the threat evaporated once voters started paying attention to what he was saying. He didn't win a single primary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ross Perot, running as a third-party candidate that year, bitterly opposed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. He got 19 percent of the vote in November. That sounds impressive until you consider that Clinton and Bush, both of whom endorsed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, got a combined 80 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Perot, Gephardt wants Americans to strike back against foreigners who insist on selling us things we want. But if fear of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't work in 1992, when Japan was seen as an unbeatable rival, it certainly won't work now, when Japan is an economic invalid. Back then, Americans worried that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> might send all our jobs to Mexico. Today, we know it didn't, and won't.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It may not be a coincidence that the Democratic Party enjoyed its greatest success, from the 1930s into the 1960s, when it was the champion of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Republicans eventually abandoned protectionism and have been winning presidential elections ever since. Michael Barone, the principal author of \"The Almanac of American Politics,\" says the last time a protectionist party was the majority party nationally was in the 1920s, when high-tariff Republicans reigned.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Memo to Gephardt: Just because it worked for Herbert Hoover doesn't mean it will work for you.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: schapman@tribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Presidential hopeful Rep.

The more robust North America is, the better it can compete and project power globally. In contrast, Mr. Trump's approach seems almost designed to help elect an anti-American, pro-Castro populist, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to the Mexican presidency in 2018.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's policy of confrontation pits his hostile nationalism against an American tradition of practical internationalism. Because of historical legacies and national pride, North American integration and cooperation have been built on respect for the sovereignty and independence of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. That differs sharply from the European model of integration, which has sought shared sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider how Mr. Trump's own priorities would fare under his Mexican policy, starting with illegal immigration. Today's illegal immigrants are coming primarily from Central America. Washington should cooperate with Mexico to create a multistage defense. Working with Mexico to strengthen law enforcement, the rule of law, and intelligence would leave both countries better positioned to stop drug traffickers, criminals, human smugglers and terrorists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Insulting Mexico, on the other hand, will make it impossible for politicians there to work with Yankee gringos. A hostile Mexico can ignore the flow of people northward, while American policies that weaken investment and growth in Mexico simply create more incentives for Mexicans to migrate to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's great wall would be a waste of money, as conservative Republicans from border states now acknowledge. A combination of fencing, additional border police, electronic surveillance and other intelligence tools would stop illegal immigration more effectively and at a lower cost. Fiscal conservatives should just say no to Mr. Trump's $20 billion boondoggle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson knows that the amendments Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto made to his country's constitution in 2013 open the door to investment that will expand North American energy security and Mexico's income. Mr. Tillerson may not be aware, however, that because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s energy terms refer to Mexico's constitution, American investors are now protected against a populist reversal of Mexican policy -- but only as long as the U.S. remains in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The integration of North American energy markets helps the U.S. sell gas and electricity to Mexico while lowering costs of production in North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's policies will actually increase costs and weaken the global competitiveness of the U.S. auto sector, his favorite subject for industrial policy. Efficient manufacturing relies on integrated supply chains that crisscross borders. U.S. producers seeking to compete with Asian and European manufacturers now transfer components across North American borders up to 14 times in the process of completing final goods. More than 30% of Mexico's exports to the U.S. contribute to the integrated auto sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's protectionist economists have questioned the data on U.S. exports. Yet when the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation recalculated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> statistics to count only the value added by each country, the U.S. had a surplus in manufactured goods with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump blocks Mexico's exports, Mexico will strike back, hurting other parts of the U.S. economy. American farmers, already struggling with low prices, could forfeit sales of soybeans, corn and fruit. Poorer Mexicans will consume less, so U.S. sales will drop. American exporters of services, a source of competitive advantage and surplus, could suffer. Six million U.S. jobs depend on exports to Mexico, with workers in Texas, Michigan, Arizona and Louisiana particularly vulnerable to self-defeating economic nationalism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump will also discover that the U.S. needs friends. When I first started working with Mexico in the 1980s, I could usually guess Mexico's foreign policy by putting a minus sign in front of any U.S. position. The old one-party state of the PRI, which ruled for more than 60 years, placated leftist intellectuals by posting them to the Ministry of External Affairs, where they were free to indulge in anti-American policies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But when I became the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative in 2001, my closest partners in opening markets were Mexican and Canadian counterparts. Mexico's central bankers and economic officials became natural allies as macroeconomic policies converged. Until recently, Europeans, Asians and even other Latin Americans assumed that the three North American countries would be aligned on most foreign policies. The Mexican public's attitude toward the U.S. had shifted from sullen resentment to admiration and friendship.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Looking to the future, the alliance of the three North American democracies -- being energy self-sufficient with integrated infrastructure and efficient and secure borders -- could offer the U.S. a resilient and powerful base from which to face global challenges. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly should brief the president on the high number of Mexican-Americans in the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was chairman of the Republican National Committee, he concluded that the GOP needed to reach out to Mexican-Americans and other Hispanics. Insults and attacks on citizens' home countries are not a winning formula for the future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state and the man with the vision to purchase Alaska, wrote in 1853 that someday Mexico, Canada and the U.S. would create a North American union, but only after a long process and solely through free choice. Seward fought for America's national union while also promoting an internationalist vision. Vice President Mike Pence and members of the cabinet have tried to reassure allies in Europe and Asia that a nationalist America can be internationalist, too. Mr. Trump should apply this correction at home and stop abusing America's amicable and vital neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Zoellick is a former World Bank president, U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative and deputy secretary of state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Robert B.

{"id": "2115065123.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump\u2019s \u2018historic\u2019 trade deal doesn\u2019t look so historic after all</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Well, that was unnecessarily painful.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After spending a year and a half alienating our friends, punishing our farmers and manufacturers with devastating tariffs and counter-tariffs, and fracturing the hard-won alliance we had built to isolate and pressure China, we finally got a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal \u2014 and a \"new\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet somehow, they look an awful lot like the old ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Sunday evening, news broke that Canada agreed to the terms of a renegotiated North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Not merely renegotiated: rebranded! What was once the easily pronounceable \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" will hereafter be the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or \"USMCA.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why the name change was needed is a little unclear. Our marketer in chief clearly loves rebranding things, and USMCA, while it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does have the virtue of literally putting America first. Oddly, the posted text of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact itself still repeatedly refers to itself as \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2018.\" I guess someone forgot to search-and-replace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As to the substance, well, the best you can say is it could have been a whole lot worse. President Trump didn't, as he threatened, blow up the system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, you know, whoop de doo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are some new protectionist measures, such as complicated new requirements for auto rules of origin, which could potentially backfire. That is, they may end up being so costly to adhere to that they'll encourage manufacturers to move more of their operations and jobs outside of North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other stuff, such as a \"sunset\" provision requiring members to regularly reaffirm their desire to continue the three-party deal, is probably also not an improvement. There are better ways to encourage ongoing modernization of the deal that would involve less policy uncertainty for businesses. But, again, this section is not as bad as many businesses and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also won some modest concessions in tiny industries he's weirdly obsessed with, such as Canadian dairy. He has conveniently played down the concessions he made in exchange: In return for greater American access to the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg markets, we gave Canada greater access to U.S. markets for dairy, peanuts, processed peanut products, sugar and sugar-containing products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for the most part, despite Trump's assertion that \"it's not <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> redone, it's a brand-new deal,\" the president mostly kept <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> intact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more, some of the more significant changes \u2014 relating to issues such as labor standards, environmental protections and e-commerce \u2014 appear to be cribbed from another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that Trump has demonized: the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you (like me) supported TPP, this is either reassuring or supremely frustrating.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Barack Obama negotiated TPP \u2014 a 12-party pact that included Canada and Mexico \u2014 as part of his own promise to \"renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" TPP was also Obama's strategy for keeping China from writing \"the rules of the road\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. China was deliberately excluded from the pact, which was designed to cement a coalition of countries that had been wounded by China's misbehavior. Working together, these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> victims hoped to pressure China to reform.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's first orders of business as president, of course, was to pull out of TPP. He soon thereafter picked unnecessary <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fights with TPP countries we'd previously tried to make common cause with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Trump seems to have realized his mistake. Despite how he characterizes his \"historic transaction,\" the USMCA is mostly just a smooshing together of two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals that he derided as the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals ever made, as Dartmouth Tuck School of Business professor Emily Blanchard points out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, a bunch of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 language appears squarely aimed at returning to Obama's alliance strategy for isolating China \u2014 which, to reiterate, only requires rebuilding because Trump destroyed it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-replacement deal includes \"protections against misappropriation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets, including by state-owned enterprises,\" one of China's major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sins. Likewise, there's also language designed to disincentivize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 signatories from making free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with \"non-market\" countries, widely understood to be targeting China. Some have speculated that Trump may press for similar language in negotiations with other countries, such as Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, Trump has wrought a lot of destruction in service of landing us in roughly the same position we would have been in had we simply stayed in TPP and pursued more amicable negotiations with Mexico and Canada on other outstanding issues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of these harms \u2014 such as the steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures that, despite Sunday's announcement, remain on the books \u2014 may yet be reversible. But the damage to our reputation as a reliable trading partner and ally may be irreparable. To Trump, that may be a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "1825170055.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's Nafta Mistakes Are Huge</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Donald Trump said during the first presidential debate that the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) \"is the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\" Such hyperbolic rhetoric -- butchered syntax and all -- was undoubtedly cheered by his base. But it is not supported by the facts. As a result it harms his case with Republican holdouts, whom Mr. Trump needs to win but who distrust his fast-and-loose economics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican is promising to force a renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But he doesn't seem to realize that Mexico gave up more tariff protection than the U.S. did when the agreement was signed in 1993. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is reopened, Mexico is unlikely to accept new limits on its access to the U.S. market. If a standoff leads to the end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, both countries would revert to their commitments under World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization rules and the existing \"most-favored nation\" tariff schedule. That would hurt, not help, the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump is so reckless on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that he makes Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, who wrote the book on Big Labor protectionism, seem sane. At least she acknowledged in the debate the importance of opening new markets abroad. \"We are 5% of the world's population. We have to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the other 95%,\" she said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately neither of the candidates is good on this critical issue but the Republicans advising Mr. Trump should know better. His attempt to slam <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> by pointing to a 16% value-added tax that Mexican importers pay, for example, is misleading. This tax applies to transactions on both foreign and domestic-made goods, like the New York sales tax. It doesn't discriminate against imports, and the importer recovers it by charging it to the customer. That's Econ 101.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> disrupted the economic status quo in the U.S. -- as it did in Mexico. There have been winners and losers. But the U.S. dislocations are minor compared with those that occur from technological advances or when companies move production from high-tax, union-dominated U.S. states to low-tax, right-to-work states, and especially so when compared with the economic efficiencies gained.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump gave a quick nod to one genuine U.S. disadvantage during the debate when he talked about cutting U.S. corporate tax rates to spur investment at home. But his main message was that under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mexico is \"stealing\" U.S. jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, an interconnected North American economy has made U.S. manufacturing globally competitive. U.S. companies source components from Mexico and Canada and add value in innovation, design and marketing. The final outputs are among the most high-quality, low-price products in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. automotive competitiveness is highly dependent on global free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. According to the Mexico City-based consulting firm De la Calle, Madrazo, Mancera, 37% of the U.S.'s imported auto components came from Mexico and Canada in 2015. This sourcing from abroad is important to good-paying U.S. auto-assembly jobs. But parts also flow the other way. U.S. parts manufacturers sent 61% of their exports to Mexico and Canada in 2015.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This synergy has made the U.S. auto industry attractive for investment. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis investment in the auto sector contracted. But from 2010-14 almost $70 billion was invested in the North American automotive industry. Mr. Trump claims that investment is going to Mexico but two-thirds of it went into the U.S., according to a January 2015 report by the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This investment dynamism helped generate 264,800 new U.S. jobs in motor-vehicle production and parts between January 2010 and June 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a 40% increase in employment despite the increasing trend toward robotics in the industry. Shut down <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and these workers and future job seekers will pay.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. agriculture would also suffer. U.S. farm products now enter Mexico practically tariff-free and in 2013 (the latest year that data is available) it was the third-largest foreign market for U.S. farm output after China and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Let's suppose that Mexico won't give up ground in a new round of negotiations and Mr. Trump is successful in leading the repeal of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That would mean a reversion back to the WTO-agreed duties that each country charges nations without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. In 2013 Mexico's weighted average tariff on agricultural products was 38.4%, which would be quite a climb over the zero tariff-rate that U.S. exporters now face. U.S. manufacturers that ship to Mexico would be hit with a weighted average tariff on industrial goods of 7.7%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Keep in mind that Mexico has many bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Competitors from those countries would have large duty-free advantages over American farmers and manufacturers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's outlandishness is supposed to be one of his strengths. But when it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> he is not politically incorrect. He is factually incorrect.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Trump's Right: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Has Been Loser for U.S.\" -- WSJ October 14, 2016)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "409878412.xml", "text": "<h2>A Toxic Trade-off</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pressing for passage of the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement at a White House news conference in May, President Bush made the case that a vote for CAFTA was a vote for democracy: \"By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area, we will promote democratic governance, human rights and economic liberty for everyone,\" he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But lawmakers who voted to pass CAFTA in late July may not have realized that a part of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement threatens to do just the opposite. That's because of a little-understood legal clause included in CAFTA, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), and other, already existing bilateral investment treaties. Designed to protect foreign investors against unfair treatment by a signatory state, these \"investor-state arbitration\" provisions actually hand foreign businesses powerful rights that trump the interests or desires of local citizens.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the example of the current bid by U.S.-Canadian corporation Glamis Gold Ltd. to mine the ore in Guatemala's Western highlands. Local community and church leaders have vigorously protested the company's plans to dig an open-pit gold and silver mine in the department of San Marcos. They contend that the mining process, which uses cyanide to extract gold from ore, could leach deadly toxins into the surrounding water supply. After construction began in 2004, the indigenous poor --  who make up most of the region's population and depend on scarce local water  --  began protesting the mine. They continued for months into this year, even though the government dispatched the military to quell the protests and local leaders reportedly received death threats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to these health and safety concerns, the government of Guatemala could decide either to ban the cyanide process or to require the company to compensate surrounding communities for their risk. The vice president has said that the government wouldn't do anything the people don't want. But stopping the Glamis project now could be costly: Under CAFTA, the government of Guatemala could be liable for tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How can a multinational corporation that objects to local environmental, health or safety regulations sue a national government? That license is provided under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Once CAFTA is signed, it will provide the same right. In each case, a provision of the agreement allows a foreign corporation to sue a national government for money damages if it believes that the actions of the federal, state or local government in a given country are discriminatory, violate international law or can be considered  --  directly or indirectly  --  an expropriation of the company's investment. If complying with an environmental regulation makes a project no longer worth the cost, a company can claim that its investment has been expropriated by the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether the company is in the right won't be decided by an independent judge, however. Rather, it will be decided by a panel of three private international arbitrators chosen by the parties involved. These arbitrators are often corporate lawyers, who, in another suit, could be representing the investor. Affected citizens are not parties to the case. The government's right to protect the water supply in Guatemala, then, could be decided by British or American lawyers, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And it's not just a matter of a powerful multinational corporation challenging a struggling Central American country. In fact, Glamis, the company that's digging the mine in Guatemala, has already brought a similar legal action against the United States. In 2003, Glamis filed for arbitration under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, claiming that environmental and historic preservation regulations passed in California after the company had received a federal permit to dig there amount to an expropriation. The regulations, championed by then-governor Gray Davis in response to strong local protests, require that open-pit gold mines be backfilled and returned to their pre-mined condition after the ore has been depleted. Claiming that the cost of backfilling would destroy the future economic value of its project, Glamis brought a $50 million claim against the United States. (The matter hasn't been resolved yet.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Defenders of arbitration provisions claim that critics' concerns are overblown, and emphasize that, unlike Canada and Mexico, the United States has yet to lose one of these cases. Still, many legal experts argue that the provisions violate state and national sovereignty: They allow foreign investors to make an end-run around the federal courts, which usually rule on the legitimacy of public laws. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s adoption: \"Article III of our Constitution reserves to federal courts the power to decide cases and controversies, and the U.S. Congress may not delegate to another tribunal 'the essential attributes of judicial power.' Whether our Congress has done so with respect to tribunals created by different treaties and agreements is a critical question.\" John Echeverria, executive director of Georgetown University's Environmental Law and Policy Institute, puts it more starkly: \"Congress is virtually sleepwalking through a revolutionary, and likely highly destructive, alteration of the American constitutional system of government.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Echeverria is referring to the threat to U.S. sovereignty when, for example, the Canadian division of Glamis challenges the legitimacy of a California law by suing the United States. With agreements like CAFTA between rich and poor countries, the sovereignty question also has another, more sinister twist: Although these treaties protect corporations against the vagaries of unpredictable governments, they can also make it easier for corrupt national leaders to ignore the interests of their own populations and sign lucrative contracts with foreign corporations. This is a longstanding problem with extractive industries like mining and the countries that depend on them. And this sort of corruption is one reason why poverty in those countries has soared in recent decades. According to the United Nations, in 1981, 61 percent of people in mineral and energy exporting countries were living on less than $1 per day; by 1999, that number was 82 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, companies need some protections when they invest. If Guatemala suddenly nationalized its mining industry, for example, seizing all foreign-owned mines, foreign corporations would understandably be aggrieved. But enacting environmental, health or safety regulations is a different matter. The United States Supreme Court has made clear that even if a regulation significantly reduces the value of a company's investment, the government needn't compensate that loss. Environmental regulations are part of the cost of doing business. It's far cheaper to dump toxic waste into a river than to dispose of it safely, but we still want our government to impose the cost of safe disposal on companies creating the hazard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The mining industry spews almost half of all toxic emissions in some countries, in the process ruining local agriculture and causing a substantial boost in respiratory disorders and raising cancer rates,\" according to a recent, critical report on investor arbitration rights written by Oxfam America and Friends of the Earth. Mining will only encourage real development, they conclude, if it's properly regulated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Increasingly, people in developing countries are demanding just that. And it's a sign of progress. If democratically elected governments enacted laws in response to these legitimate concerns, that would be another important step; in fact, it'd be exactly what we want \"developing\" countries to do. And it's what the United States government claims to be encouraging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, with the proliferation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment agreements that hand foreign investors surprisingly broad rights, local governments are losing the power to protect their people, environment and economy. Investor protection clauses \"essentially restrict the ability of governments to impose public interest or environmental regulations on corporate operations,\" says Keith Slack, an extractive industries expert for Oxfam America. And this hinders the very sort of development that would, in the long run, make poor countries not only better places for people to live, but far better places for American corporations to do business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These arbitration provisions also highlight the inconsistency of the Bush administration's approach to sovereignty under international law. According to many legal experts (including lawyers now bringing these claims), the significance of investor- state arbitration provisions, which wasn't clear at the time <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was enacted under the Clinton administration, in the last few years has become so. The Bush administration has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gases and the treaty creating the International Criminal Court on the grounds that these treaties threaten U.S. sovereignty. But when it came time to push for Congressional support of CAFTA and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts that compromise U.S. sovereignty for the benefit of big business, the administration's concerns about the integrity of our legislative and judicial system had disappeared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The debate over these sorts of agreements isn't over whether or not to have \"free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" All <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is regulated  --  just a quick glance at the 22 chapters of CAFTA alone makes that plain. The conflict is over which rules will make the liberalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefit both foreign investors and local villagers. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that binds the hands of local governments for the benefit of foreign corporations will only undermine democracy  --  and in the long run, global development itself.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Author's e-mail:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>daphneeviatar@earthlink.net</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Daphne Eviatar is a contributing editor at the American Lawyer and a 2005 fellow with the Alicia Patterson Foundation.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398278510.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA's Protectionist Bent</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pandering to protectionists is poisoning the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. In its attempt to get a so-called free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact approved, not only is the Bush administration surrendering to Congress's demands, but it may be setting a precedent for higher U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers against scores of other countries. It calls to mind the Carter administration's surrender to Soviet demands in the SALT II talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The key protectionist danger in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> lies in its new rules of origin. Rules of origin are the federal regulations that determine the national origin of an imported good. For most imports, national origin is determined by the country in which the product was last substantially transformed into a \"new and different article of commerce.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will have more protectionist rules of origin for autos, televisions, and especially clothing. In 1984 the U.S. Customs Service, at the behest of the domestic textile industry, announced a much more restrictive rule of origin for apparel, decreeing that the nation of origin would depend not on where fabric was finally sewed or assembled, but on the nation of origin of both the fabric and of the sewing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> builds on this precedent to concoct a super-protectionist rule of origin for apparel. It requires not only that clothing be sewed in North America from fabric made in North America, but that the yarn the fabric is made from also be from North America -- a triple rule of origin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The intent of this \"yarn forward\" rule is to oblige Mexican and Canadian apparel makers to buy yarn and fabrics from American textile mills before being allowed to sell clothing to U.S. consumers. This makes as much sense as forcing Belgian companies to use American sugar for their chocolate exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many types of yarn and fabrics are not produced in the U.S. But Mexican and Canadian companies that must rely on those yarns or fabrics to produce products for export to the U.S. will have to get special exemptions from the triple rule of origin. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will have byzantine regulations for determining whether specific yarns and fabrics are in \"short supply\" in the U.S. And who will likely be the final judge? The American textile industry's best friend, the U.S. Commerce Department. (During the mid-to-late 1980s, Commerce ran a similar short-supply program for steel products; the General Accounting Office concluded that Commerce officials \"viewed it as their responsibility . . . to keep foreign steel out of the U.S.\")</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The short-supply system could empower U.S. bureaucrats to heavily influence which fabrics Mexican factories use to produce dresses that Americans will buy. At a June 29 closed-door meeting, retailers, importers and apparel manufacturers presented a list of 117 fabrics they considered to be in short supply in North America; U.S. textile manufacturers responded by insisting that only eight fabrics are in short supply. Ron Sorini, the chief U.S. textile negotiator, who was present at the meeting, appears to have accepted the textile manufacturers' claims. This means that the U.S. government is likely to deny short-supply exemptions in the vast majority of cases.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The short-supply system will also hurt Canadian apparel makers. Four years after President Reagan signed the Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada, the Bush administration is demanding that Canada accept new restrictions on the number of wool suits it can export to the U.S. (The U.S. currently imposes no textile import quotas on Canada.) Wool suits are one of Canada's most successful garment exports, and, since Canadian apparel makers import most of their fabric from Europe, the \"yarn forward\" rule will throttle their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Israel Shames, president of the Quebec Apparel Manufacturers Institute, estimates that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could halve Canada's exports of some apparel items. Jack Kivenko, president of the Canadian Apparel Manufacturers Institute, estimates that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could result in the loss of as many as 40,000 jobs in the Canadian apparel industry. Mr. Kivenko complains: \"America is drawing up rules to keep the threat of a Canadian apparel invasion down to a mere trickle. Every time the Americans 'level the playing field,' we find that Canadians have higher hurdles to jump.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judging from the current negotiation, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is likely to sow other seeds of national conflict. Customs Service Commissioner Carol Hallett told a congressional hearing in May that she presumes that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will allow U.S. agents to enter Mexico in search of illegally labeled goods, as States News Service has reported. (Some congressmen fear that Mexican companies may purchase Chinese clothing and attach a \"Made in Mexico\" label.) Last December, two busloads of heavily armed Customs agents pulled up outside of the Empire State Building in New York and ransacked the offices of 20 textile companies, browbeating employees and seizing hundreds of boxes and computer tapes to investigate whether the companies complied with U.S. textile import regulations. If U.S. Customs agents pulled a similar stunt in Mexico City or Toronto, U.S.-Mexican or -Canadian relations could be devastated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico currently provides barely 3% of U.S. textile and apparel imports. Yet the archprotectionist textile rule of origin will likely be applied to other nations in the future. Textile negotiator Sorini explicitly declared that the yarn-forward rule will guide future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations: \"This will be a model for all future free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. We feel we have balanced the interests of business.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Furthermore, the U.S.'s preferential treatment of Mexican imports could hurt other Latin American nations. If, for example, both Mexico and Guatemala are shipping lace brassieres to the U.S. and the U.S. abolishes the 32% tariff for Mexican producers but retains it for Guatemalan producers, then Guatemalan producers will be left at a severe disadvantage. Puerto Rican government officials have warned that eliminating tariffs on Mexican textiles while maintaining tariffs on Caribbean textiles could torpedo the entire Caribbean textile industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will give too much discretion to Customs Service employees, who have injected protectionist intention into previous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws. This February, for example, Customs bureaucrats bushwhacked Honda with a profoundly creative, retroactive interpretation of the U.S.-Canada Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, ruling that automobile engine blocks that are cast, shaped, machined and finished at a Honda plant in Ohio are not made in America. The Honda decision created much ill will north of the border, making many Canadians suspect that hypocrisy is now the U.S.'s leading export.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is also danger in how much political ransom the Bush administration may pay Congress to get <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> approved. Democrats have already demanded a large increase in spending for government job training programs to ameliorate the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. However, as a recent Labor Department report showed, government job training is one of the worst things politicians can inflict on young workers. The Labor Department found that young male trainees in the Job Training Partnership Act, the nation's premier job-training program, have significantly lower earnings than similar youths who were never trained by the government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The negotiations are not yet complete. The Bush administration still has a chance to drop its protectionist stance and make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a treaty worth signing. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not complex; it does not require an army of bureaucrats to define and re-define it. It is protectionism that requires endless administrative gimmicks to camouflage its true nature. With each new politically contrived definition of fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiators are sowing the seeds of future uncertainty, accusations and ill will.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bovard writes often on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n"}

The average hourly compensation, including benefits, for a production-line worker in the United States in 1992 was $16.17; in Mexico, it was $2.35. The minimum wage in the U.S. is $4.25 an hour. In Mexico, it is $4.60 a day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Green Giant plant that left 200 American workers jobless when it moved from Watsonville, Calif., to Irapuato, Mexico, in the early-1980's was able to cut the wages it paid to vegetable trimmers from $7.58 an hour to 83 cents an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These are some of the reasons why workers in the United States are afraid that big companies will continue taking their jobs south, and that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will accelerate the trend.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The plight of Mexican workers is grim. They don't have much in the way of rights by American standards and President Salinas is committed to keeping it that way. His overall economic strategy is to move away from protectionism, opening Mexico up for foreign investment. There is no better way to attract investment than to insure that labor costs remain low.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican labor unions are tightly controlled. They have to apply to the Government for permission to strike. There were more than 7,000 applications to the federal Government in 1991, according to Harley Shaiken, a labor expert from the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the Mexican economy. Only 136 of them were approved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is only the tiniest chance that a truly independent union will even be recognized by the Government. A dispute has arisen over how many have been recognized in the past decade or so. Said Mr. Shaiken: \"Some say it's been one. Those that use a broader definition say it's been two.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mexico is not just a country that deliberately sacrifices the well-being of its workers in the name of economic development. It's also a land of torture and extreme poverty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several respected human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Committee Against Torture, have complained about the extensive use of torture by federal and state police officials in Mexico, and the failure of the Government to make substantial efforts to stop it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Carlos Salinas (no relation to the President) is an official with Amnesty International. In testimony before a U.S. Congressional subcommittee last month, he said, \"Mexican violators are not accountable and they are brazen.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He told the committee \"they beat and kick their victims\"; they \"introduce carbonated water with chili pepper up the victim's nose\"; they \"semi-asphyxiate\" them by putting plastic bags over their heads or submerging their heads in water; they shock them with electric prods or leave them hanging by their wrists for long periods of time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas, mindful of the negative impact that human rights abuses could have on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, has instituted reforms, but there is little real enforcement. The torture, according to Amnesty International and the other organizations, continues.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is estimated that more than half of the 82 million Mexicans live in poverty, and 18 million in \"extreme poverty.\" Amid these conditions a million new workers enter the job market each year and two-thirds cannot find full-time employment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It will be a long time before we see tremendous purchasing power in Mexico.

Obama calls his previous <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> rhetoric \"overheated\" and essentially endorses what one of his senior economic advisers privately told the Canadians: The anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> stuff was nothing more than populist posturing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is there much left of his primary season pledge to meet \"without preconditions\" with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

What's the downside? He won't lose the left, or even mainstream Democrats. They won't stay home Nov. 4. The anti-Bush, anti-Republican sentiment is simply too strong.

Not Obama. After all, this is a press corps that heard his grandiloquent Philadelphia speech -- designed to rationalize why \"I can no more disown [Rev. Jeremiah Wright] than I can disown my white grandmother\" -- then wiped away a tear and hailed him as the second coming of Abraham Lincoln. Three months later, with Wright disowned, grandma embraced and the great \"race speech\" now inoperative, not a word of reconsideration is heard from his media acolytes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worry about the press? His FISA flip-flop elicited a few grumbles from lefty bloggers, but hardly a murmur from the mainstream media. Remember his pledge to stick to public financing? Now flush with cash, he is the first general-election candidate since Watergate to opt out. Some goo-goo clean-government types chided him, but the mainstream editorialists who for years had been railing against private financing as hopelessly corrupt and corrupting, evinced only the mildest of disappointment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, The New York Times expressed a sympathetic understanding of Obama's about-face by buying his preposterous claim that it was a pre-emptive attack on McCain's 527 independent expenditure groups -- notwithstanding the fact that (a) as Politico's Jonathan Martin notes, \"there are no serious anti-Obama 527s in existence nor are there any immediate plans to create such a group\" and (b) the only independent ad of any consequence now running in the entire country is an AFSCME-MoveOn.org co-production savaging John McCain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, Obama's U-turn on public financing was not done for ideological reasons, it was done for Willie Sutton reasons: That's where the money is. It nonetheless betrayed a principle that so many in the press claimed to hold dear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As public financing is not a principle dear to me, I am hardly dismayed by Obama's abandonment of it. Nor am I disappointed in the least by his other calculated and cynical repositionings. I have never had any illusions about Obama. I merely note with amazement that his media swooners seem to accept his every policy reversal with an equanimity unseen since the Daily Worker would change the party line overnight -- switching sides in World War II, for example -- whenever the wind from Moscow changed direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The truth about Obama is uncomplicated. He is just a politician (though of unusual skill and ambition). The man who dared say it plainly is the man who knows Obama all too well. \"He does what politicians do,\" explained Wright.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it's time to throw campaign finance reform, telecom accountability, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation or Wright overboard, Obama is not sentimental. He does not hesitate. He tosses lustily.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why, the man even tossed his own grandmother overboard back in Philadelphia -- only to haul her back on deck now that her services are needed. Yesterday, granny was the moral equivalent of the raving Rev. Wright.

{"id": "2098605775.xml", "text": "<h2>A Bogus Deal on Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is a nearly 25-year-old agreement that needs to be modernized to address new technologies, update intellectual property rights and protect American industry and workers from unfair competition. Instead, President Trump has proposed replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with something worse, a vague agreement that could hurt American workers and raise prices for American consumers while antagonizing America's neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the Trumpian worldview, Canada isn't a friendly neighbor but a frosty enemy bent on ruining our steel, auto and dairy industries while cutting down forests in British Columbia and trucking the lumber across the border. Fiends! Likewise, as he sees it, Mexico ships tequila, produce and people north, and imports our higher-paying manufacturing jobs. Desperados! Yet his solutions would simply add complications with few benefits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the revised, don't-call-it-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bilateral deal with Mexico that he awkwardly announced last week, 75 percent of the value of vehicles exported to the United States would have to come from North American-made parts, up from the current 62.5 percent. And 40-to-45 percent of the value would have to be made by workers who earn at least $16 an hour, even though no Mexican autoworkers earn $16 an hour, and none will. Otherwise, Mexican-assembled vehicles would be subject to a 2.5 percent tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The logic here is that auto-related jobs would supposedly flood back to the United States as labor costs rise in Mexico. That logic is dubious. Automakers in Mexico would rather pay the 2.5 percent tariff, figuring it would not raise prices enough to hurt sales seriously. If it did, they could stop making those cars for the American market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump has particular animus for the dairy industry in Canada. There's no question that protectionist constraints keep milk prices there high and farmers profitable. The Canadians have pointed to subsidies that American farmers get and are resisting Mr. Trump's no-compromise demand to throw their cows under the bus. Mr. Trump also wants Canada to join Mexico in agreeing to drop Chapter 19 of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a dispute resolution protocol. Canada has used it to fight off tariffs on its softwood and paper products. Mr. Trump's softwood and paper tariffs are hurting Canadian industry, but also are raising lumber prices in the United States so much that the housing market has slowed. Isn't that a great deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American farmers have been big losers in this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war and would remain so under this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal. After Mr. Trump assessed tariffs on Mexican metals, Mexico imposed tariffs on corn and pork. The bilateral agreement restores the status quo on agriculture, but Mexico has, in the meantime, cultivated other sources of supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Auto companies have developed global supply chains since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> began in 1994, costing thousands of manufacturing jobs in the United States, as low-value work shifted to Mexico and other lower-cost countries. Auto companies have also built plants here using the same supply chain rationale, though, partly because labor costs in those American plants have decreased in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Mexico, in turn, is becoming less dependent on the American market every year -- meaning the deal is covering fewer and fewer jobs. So Mr. Trump's deal isn't going to be getting jobs back from Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on cars if Canada doesn't submit to his demands will be painful -- to Canada, and to General Motors, which produces the Chevrolet Impala and other models there. He's also threatened the European Union, which has offered to remove tariffs on autos if the United States does the same. That's not good enough for Mr. Trump, who thinks Europeans should be forced to buy American-made cars. Should the president carry out threats to hit imports, the United States stands to lose 200,000 jobs, according to Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, because cars assembled in the United States contain imported parts, including engines. Prices would rise; sales would fall. Auto sales are cooling globally, so creating obstacles for the industry is foolish policy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Having failed to browbeat Canada into submission by the American-imposed Aug. 31 deadline, the administration told Congress it will go ahead with the Mexico deal. Canada is free to join under those terms, within 30 days. No thank you, said the ever diplomatic Canadian minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland. \"Once we have a good deal for Canada,\" Ms. Freeland said, \"we have a deal.\" The ever-petulant Mr. Trump then tweet-threatened not only Canada but his own Congress: \"If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse, Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> entirely & we will be far better off...\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We will certainly not be better off. Nor is Congress planning to cede its authority in treaty making. The president can and should expect a bipartisan pushback against an unnecessary and abusive bad \"deal.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Canada has oil, electricity, water, all the things that the United States desperately needs,\" notes Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor Canada, a leading <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> union. \"So for him to pick a fight with us makes no sense, either philosophically or economically.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correct, Mr. Dias.

{"id": "2355472498.xml", "text": "<h2>The Senate's descent into irrelevance</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Shortly before the Senate, sitting as an impeachment court, contemplated the president's misbehavior, it demonstrated its own flair for disregarding rules and violating norms. Done with bipartisan bonhomie, the episode illuminates the decay of government.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bill Clinton's finest achievement as president, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, passed in December 1993 with more Senate and House support from Republicans (34 and 132) than from Democrats (27 and 102). Many Democrats predicted devastation of U.S.-manufacturing, and Donald Trump was characteristically Cassandra-like. Today manufacturing capacity is 66 percent larger than in 1994. Undeterred by evidence, candidate Trump termed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a 'disaster' and 'the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal maybe ever signed anywhere.'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As president he is replacing it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is remarkably similar to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with two significant exceptions: It is the first U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement designed to decrease <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and it is larded with Democratic policy objectives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) notes, under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> there were zero tariffs on 100 percent of manufactured goods and 97.5 percent of agricultural products that crossed the three nations' borders. U.S. exports to Mexico increased 500 percent. The USMCA's constructive modernizations of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \" the enormous digital economy did not exist in 1994 \" are, Toomey says, 'mostly taken from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,' which was negotiated by the Obama administration, and for that reason was anathema to Trump. His scrapping of the TPP was a gift to China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA ends free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in automobiles and auto parts with Mexico: By imposing impossible minimum-wage requirements on Mexican factories, the USMCA guarantees that cars and parts will be subject to tariffs \" taxes paid by U.S. consumers. The USMCA also compels Mexico to change its labor laws to promote unionization. And the provision that the USMCA expires in 16 years is, Toomey says, 'designed to have a chilling effect on investment.' He notes that members of Congress who have opposed every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement before this one support it, as does the AFL-CIO, which generally opposes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's substance is regrettable. The process that produced it was even more so because it was lawless.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Agreements that fully comply with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority (TPA) cannot be amended and can be passed by a simple majority. But the USMCA did not comply: The implementing legislation was not submitted to Congress 30 days before a committee or floor vote on it, a requirement necessary if Congress is to perform its constitutional duty to establish <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Also, the TPA requires that the implementing legislation contain only provisions 'strictly necessary or appropriate' for implementation. Otherwise, the TPA's expedited process could be used to sneak extraneous matters into law without adequate scrutiny, or possible opposition through amendment, or a 60-vote threshold. But for the first time ever, implementing legislation contained appropriations, $843 million, including $50 million for salaries and expenses for the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative, which was designated an 'emergency.'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Senate and its once-formidable Finance Committee are, Toomey believes, being 'marginalized' and made 'irrelevant' as the executive wields authority delegated to it by Congress \" but without Congress insisting on compliance with the terms of the delegation. The question, Toomey says, is: 'Are we willing to enforce our own law that governs the proceedings of this body?'</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) felt similarly in December when Congress 'passed a $1.4 trillion spending extravaganza, complete with half a trillion dollars in tax cuts and a bevy of favors for special interests \" all without debate and without committee consideration, based on decisions made by the bill's sponsors over a weekend.' The $300 billion 'Cadillac tax,' a restraint on lavish employer-provided health plans, was repealed. This demonstrated that Congress cannot repeal Obamacare but will not pay for it. Amendments were not allowed, debate was limited to 90 minutes, and the Senate voted on the bill less than three days after it was unveiled. 'Senate leadership clearly didn't want it to be understood or discussed,' Cassidy said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 116th Congress, now in its second year, there have been, Toomey notes, votes on just 20 amendments \" one was a 'sense of the Senate' legal nullity, four were 'noncontroversial or largely devoid of substance,' six 'were killed using a procedural maneuver,' and none of the other nine 'came close to passage.' The Finance Committee has held one substantive markup in 13-months.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's institutional vandalism is partially explained, although not excused, by the breadth and depth of his ignorance concerning the manners and mores of a republic. The Senate's self-degradation is even more depressing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>georgewill@washpost.com</p>\n"}

The official rationale for launching this probe wasn't that foreign countries were \"dumping\" their products at unfairly low prices, stealing our intellectual property or otherwise engaging in the sort of foul play that administrations past have alleged when threatening tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No, in this case, Trump has instructed Commerce to probe whether imports of automobiles and auto parts \"threaten to impair the national security.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, you read that right.

The logic was shaky then; it's maxing out the Richter scale now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even U.S. automakers don't think auto tariffs would be justified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We are confident that vehicle imports do not pose a national security risk to the U.S.,\" said the Auto Alliance, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> group of U.S. and foreign manufacturers that operate in the United States. \"We urge the Administration to support policies that remove barriers to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and we will continue to work with them and provide input to achieve that goal.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, U.S. auto imports are dominated by our biggest military allies. Last year, 98 percent of new passenger vehicle imports came from Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union, according to the Commerce Department's International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Administration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To add insult to injury, literally a day before Trump made this announcement, he told reporters that he was working to ease penalties on ZTE.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ZTE, you may recall, is a partially state-owned Chinese telecom giant that admitted to illegally selling phones to Iran and North Korea. Our intelligence community has repeatedly called it a national security threat, saying that ZTE devices could be used as surveillance tools against Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So how is it that Trump seems so unconcerned by the (real) national security risk posed by a Chinese firm that may be spying on us, and so much more worried about the (imagined) national security risk of cars made by our friends?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe this is just what happens when you're stuck in the 1980s, when Japan auto panic reached a fever pitch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More likely, Trump has gotten drunk on a power that Congress ceded to the White House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Expansion Act of 1962, Congress \u2014 which the Constitution says is supposed to regulate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \u2014 authorized the president to impose tariffs when required by \"national security,\" regardless of any existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. This law offers relatively broad language about what \"national security\" means, however. And compared to some other kinds of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes, the process here for determining what justifies a tariff is relatively nontransparent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of which suggests that this authority could be easily abused.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Previous presidents, however, have very rarely invoked it, generally for sensitive commodities such as uranium and oil. And with good reason: Slapping tariffs willy-nilly in the name of \"national security\" could provoke other countries to retaliate in the name of their own \"national security.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know if I do it, you'll do it, too, and that could ruin the whole thing for everybody,\" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Those countries might be desperate to make a deal, no matter how lousy, rather than face the painful possibility of losing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether and getting stuck with a 25 percent auto tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem with that strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Expansion Act, the president can still decide a year from now, or two years from now, to unilaterally invoke \"national security\" once again and override any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0. Which means there's no way to know that Trump won't use it as extortion again, when he wants something else.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If you're Mexico or Canada, would you trust Trump to keep his word?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And that, boys and girls, may be the real flaw in Congress's abdication of power in 1962: Lawmakers clearly assumed that we'd always have a president who cared about his \u2014 and his country's \u2014 reputation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>crampell@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "292995209.xml", "text": "<h2>Is Zedillo's Cross the Mayas' Revenge? Mexico: The Chiapas revolt, the peso meltdown, the army's new offensive-all are part of a NAFTA-bred scenario.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there ever was a reason <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a bad deal, we are looking at it now as Mexico flounders. President Clinton's decision to provide financial backing through the U.S. Treasury makes sense, if only because the near-meltdown in Mexico will affect the U.S. economy far worse than anything <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could have done directly. Even with the $50-billion bailout, the peso crash represents tremendous losses-more than $10 billion in U.S. investor funds alone, plus $10 billion in U.S. export revenues. Some put the losses as twice that, including as much as half a million U.S. jobs, a total that more than erases the 140,000-job gain the Administration claimed as the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> harvest of 1994. Add to that the expected 30% rise in illegal immigration from Mexico and the huge global stock-market drubbing, and the promise of financial stability and responsibility enshrined in the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement starts to look like a scam.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How were so many people fooled so thoroughly, and what caused the Emperor's nakedness to be so abruptly exposed? And why, on the heels of financial debacle, is President Ernesto Zedillo beating the war drum against an Indian rebellion?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Zedillo blamed the Zapatista movement for much of the financial crisis, he was criticized for trying to shift blame from the government's mismanagement. But the fact is, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation-no more than 5,000 peasants, mostly Maya Indians, in the remote state of Chiapas, -managed in less than a year to transform the power landscape of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The rebellion, which drew international media coverage on a scope unprecedented for Mexico, started with a takeover of key towns on New Year's Day, 1994. The rebels condemned the then-president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, as a traitor for betraying the principles of the Mexican Revolution leader Emiliano Zapata. They demanded the rescinding of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, calling it a death sentence for all of Mexico's already land-poor indigenous people. The initial military response was clumsy and it became news as well. Within weeks, Salinas settled for peace negotiations, a turnabout also done in the bright glare of the media.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In August, Zedillo was elected, and the government party (PRI) candidate was declared the winner in the Chiapas governor's race. The opposition in Chiapas was outraged and vowed to form a parallel government. The Zapatistas threatened to resume the war if the PRI governor was installed. He was, with Zedillo in attendance. Soon after, the rebels took over another town, their first bellicose action since January.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Dec. 20, the army moved to respond. Two days later, the peso was floated on the exchange market and went into free-fall. The army withdrew.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But what does the crash have to do with Chiapas? It was clear that the peso was overpriced, inflated in part by the massive inflow of investor dollars looking for a high return and overlooking national soundness. The investment houses of New York saw Mexico as a hot market right up till the day of the devaluation. This pressure pushed Salinas into the humiliating position of negotiating with the guerrillas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In blaming the Zapatistas, Zedillo was acknowledging that Mexico's economic boom has been built on foreign speculative investment-which, of course, is extremely sensitive to bad news in a fundamentally risky \"emerging market.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ultimately, the crisis may say much about the idea of economic reforms that are unaccompanied by serious social and political ones in the Third World. When Chiapas was thrust into the international news net in early 1994, it was not just because of the dramatic nature of the peasants' challenge to the government or the connection of agrarian misery to the newly concluded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, although both helped. It is that investors in highly liquid markets are insistent on coverage of any event that might threaten their money. Unfortunately, outside interest waned when negotiations moved behind the scenes. Now, the investors' attention has been gained too late, and at quite a cost. Only the Mexican insiders, aware of the peso's true value and shielded by government policies and secrecy about the national reserves, were able to turn a profit, rushing as they did to buy dollars before Dec. 22.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we do even the most conservative calculations and consider only the impact on U.S. investors, each armed Zapatista represents at least $1 million lost as of Christmas. The New York Times reported that U.S. holdings lost $6.5 billion in value between Dec. 1 and 22, and another $3 billion was lost in the devaluation of the peso and peso notes held by Americans. Even if half of that loss recovers with the aid of U.S. lending and other emergency measures (an increasingly doubtful scenario), investors are out $5 billion, probably more. It will be years before investment confidence returns. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> now begins to look to some like a con game to snooker the gringos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meantime, the nightmare grows worse. Zedillo's political weakness forced him to cut his losses by negotiating with the opposition and the Zapatistas regarding political reforms, including a review of the elections in Chiapas and neighboring Tabasco. Why the sudden turnaround in pursuit of a military solution? While Zedillo claims that the non-Indian elements in the rebels' leadership were uncooperative, rumors are flying that crushing the Zapatistas was a condition of the bailout.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political instability does not wear well in international finance. Zedillo has to put Mexico's house in order. The Zapatistas and the larger civil movement inspired by them have the upper hand, at least in Chiapas. That hand has been strengthened, not weakened, by the crash and the new military offensive. The worse the economy, the more attractive the rebels and the more insightful their complaints. The more the violence escalates, the more international money runs away. Clinton and the international lenders would be pound-foolish to even contemplate conditioning assistance on eradicating the rebels. This will be a long drawn-out affair. After 500 years of struggle against domination from the outside, it is not likely the Maya will become impatient or concede defeat any time soon. Even if they were to disappear tomorrow, their influence would still be felt for years in Mexico-and the investment behavior of the financial world. They may not understand it, but these ill-equipped and impoverished insurgents have gained a niche in history as the most costly army per capita to take up arms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least up to now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Duncan Earle is an anthropologist at Texas A&M University, College Station, Tex., with years of experience in Chiapas.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2235444842.xml", "text": "<h2>There is a sheer nastiness to Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump's latest foray into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is notable for its economic recklessness (it could tip Mexico into a recession, followed perhaps by the United States), its gratuitous insults of a close ally (Mexico) and its rank opportunism. (It would shift power to the White House from Congress.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For anyone who missed Trump's announcement, here's a summary. The president said he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico ($372 billion in 2018) unless it halted illegal immigration by June 10. It would add another 5 percent every month that the demand was not met until the tariff hit 25 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The timing of Trump's policy is especially offensive. Earlier, Mexico, Canada and the United States had negotiated a successor to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>); the new arrangement is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Mexico and Canada were preparing to ratify their agreements; the Trump administration was trying to assemble the necessary support.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The betrayal resembles a marriage in which one of the betrothed doesn't show up for the wedding. \"Unless the Congress intervenes or Trump changes his mind, the new USMCA is dead,\" wrote Edward Alden, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a blog post.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The implications extend beyond Trump's proposal, Alden argued. The White House has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 as authorizing Trump's ultimatum, but Alden says that law aimed to cover \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" as opposed to giving the president \"carte blanche authority to impose tariffs on close allies.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, Alden added, \"no other country \u2014 no matter how closely allied or how dependent on the United States \u2014 will be willing to negotiate any agreements with this administration, knowing they can be torn up at the whim of the president.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a sheer nastiness to Trump's proposal that seems to ignore the fact that, counting services (tourism, transportation) and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries was only about 5 percent ($66 billion) on total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of $1.385 trillion in 2018, according to government figures from the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Trump's tariffs do go into effect, the impact on Mexico's economy could be devastating, according to Shannon K. O'Neil, also of the Council on Foreign Relations. The economy has already slowed, she said, and is highly dependent on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which equals 38 percent of the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In another indication of how vulnerable economic growth may be in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell suggested that the Fed might ease monetary policy to offset any adverse effect from Trump's tariffs. The stock market rallied strongly on the news.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But whether Powell's pledge is sensible economic policy is an open question. Implying that the Fed can \u2014 and should \u2014 ease monetary policy to offset the possible hazards of Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies puts the Fed in an uncomfortable position. If the Fed does nothing, it increases the odds of a recession. If the Fed takes action, it seems to support Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> views. There are drawbacks no matter what it does or doesn't do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Republican senators have been meeting to discuss a challenge to Trump's tariffs. The situation is nothing if not fluid. But whatever happens, Alden is surely correct on the main issue:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"If the Congress lets Trump get away with this, he will be free to slap tariffs on any country or any product at any time for whatever reason he dreams up. Congress's constitutional authority over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will be utterly hollow.\"</p>\n"}

The Wall Street Journal told of a man in rural Vermont who is working full time, but after the rent and other expenses are paid, does not always have money left over for food. At times he has to hunt so his family can eat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are millions of Americans who can no longer take eating for granted. I spent some time with a family in Vermont that had worked out strategies for eating. The parents ate less so there would be more food for their 6-year-old son. At times it was necessary to ship the boy to his grandmother's house to be sure that he got a decent meal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not Depression-era America we're talking about. This is America on the verge of the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton, aware of the nation's crisis in jobs, did not suggest in his North Carolina speech that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a \"no-brainer.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He said: \"Too many Republicans would say that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> today always equals economic growth. Well, it can, but only if we have a comprehensive national strategy to promote that kind of growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Some Democrats would say that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> today always equals exporting jobs and lowering wages. Well, it sure can if you don't have a comprehensive economic strategy to maintain a high-wage, high-growth economy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A comprehensive strategy to maintain a high-wage, high-growth economy. It made sense. It sounded good. Where is it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some proponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have taken a contemptuous view of the other side, dismissing the opposition as know-nothing isolationists and protectionists. That is unfair. Concern for American and Mexican workers who are being ruthlessly exploited by rapacious corporations is not a form of neo-isolationism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If anything, much of the support for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been of the knee-jerk kind. In September 300 economists sent a petition supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Mr. Clinton. The cover letter began, \"Dear Mr. President: As economists we feel it is necessary to set the record straight on the costs and benefits of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House made a big deal out of the letter. But when the People's Radio Network, a nonprofit group of 230 stations, began contacting the economists, it turned out that very few had bothered to read the massive agreement. PRN reached 150 of the 300 economists. Only 19 said they had read the agreement, and 8 did not even remember signing the petition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nevertheless they were setting the record straight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the wholesale loss of good American jobs continues. The monthly Challenger Employment Report, compiled by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said that companies announced 66,801 layoffs in October, up from 48,786 in September.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>James Challenger, president of the firm, said, \"Workers at all levels, especially recent victims of mass layoffs, must be terribly confused by all the talk from economists about a growing economy while at the same time reading an increased number of layoff announcements.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Clinton had it right in his campaign speech. \"We need not only to reduce <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers, but to prepare our entire work force not only to compete in the global economy but to live with the changes in it and make sure nobody gets left behind.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pretty words. That's what you get in campaigns.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398397192.xml", "text": "<h2>Congress Must Choose: Pigs or Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement may be derailed by congressional disgruntlement over a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> case involving pork imports from Canada. The U.S.-Canada free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement permits judgments by American and Canadian <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agencies to be appealed to a panel made up of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts from both countries. Congress bristled when a binational panel reversed a decision imposing punitive tariffs on Canadian pork imports three years ago. Another panel will probably review last week's controversial decision to impose punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber later this summer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Understandably, Mexico's free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiaters have requested the same \"dispute-settlement\" mechanism that has protected Canadian exporters. But Congress has raised the banner of pork and said, \"No.\" Congressional displeasure with the panels runs so deep that it is dimming the prospects for a North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area. But this displeasure is entirely unjustified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The history of the pork case can be traced to 1985, when U.S. pork producers brought a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> case charging that Canada unfairly subsidized the production of live swine and pork to the detriment of the U.S. industry. The U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission ruled in favor of U.S. live swine producers, but against the processed pork producers. That finding was upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1988, the pork producers brought another case, and this time -- bolstered by new congressional legislation -- they won by a divided vote in the ITC. By then, however, the U.S.-Canada Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement was in effect. The ITC's decision was reviewed by a five-person, binational panel. Twice that panel remanded the case to the ITC, and finally, the ITC ruled against the domestic industry. Then the U.S. government, claiming that the binational panel had abused its authority, convened an extraordinary panel of U.S. and Canadian judges to review the panel's decision. The judges unanimously rejected the government's charge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Mexico wants the right under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to appeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> cases to a binational panel rather than U.S. courts. Several members of Congress have threatened to reject the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> text if it incorporates the Mexican proposal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressional critics rely on public comments by several ITC commissioners criticizing the panel decision. Of course, it is a rare government official who is happy to be over-ruled. A dispute between the ITC and the panel over the merits of the case should not draw the panel into disrepute.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After all, the panel's record, unlike the ITC's, reveals a surprising degree of harmony over the merits of the case. The panel in the pork case, composed of highly qualified American and Canadian <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts, reached unanimous determinations at every stage of the proceedings. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the panel members -- Canadian or American -- deviated from their obligation to decide the case fairly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Few in Congress are likely to parse the record of the case, but the details are telling. Even the hawkish Commerce Department, determined that the Canadian subsidies were minuscule -- less than three Canadian cents per pound of imported pork. Notwithstanding the subsidies, Canadian pork has a very small share of the U.S. market. A three cent per pound duty, all the domestic producers could achieve, would hardly have affected the domestic industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congressonal criticism of the binational panels implies that the panels are biased in favor of Canadian interests. Yet the binational panels, with the concurrence of Canadian members, have affirmed the findings of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agencies. Nothing in the overall record of the binational panel system suggests that its members have voted their passports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pork case is a foolish reason to oppose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Major changes are under way south of the Rio Grande. This country can either help shape those events or it can stand aside and let events unfold. The oinkings of the pork producers and their congressional sponsors should not control that critical decision.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Parker, formerly counsel to the chairman of the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission, is an attorney in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Don't Butcher U.S. Law For a Pig in a Poke\" -- WSJ July 30, 1992)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>920708-0046</p>\n"}

Hillary Clinton promises to send special envoys to foreign capitals the day after she's elected. Barack Obama offers to reach out to America's foes as well as friends. Unfortunately, none of this will matter if they continue to spout dangerous, ill-informed rhetoric about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What the rest of the world  --  particularly poorer countries  --  really wants is for the United States to continue its historic role in opening up the world economy. For a struggling farmer in Kenya, access to world markets is far more important than foreign aid or U.N. programs. If the candidates think they will charm the world while adopting protectionist policies, they are in for a surprise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Already the mood is shifting abroad. Listening to the Democrats on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \"is enough to send jitters down the spine of most in India,\" says the Times Now TV channel in New Delhi. The Canadian media have shared in the global swoon for Obama, but Greg Weston recently wrote in the Edmonton Sun: \"What he is actually saying  --  and how it might affect Canada  --  may come as a surprise to otherwise devout Barack boosters.\" The African press has reported on George W. Bush's visit with affection and, in some cases, contrasted his views on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the Democratic candidates'. The Bangkok Post compared the Democrats unfavorably with John McCain and his vision of an East Asia bound together, and to the United States, by expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The backlash could be greatest against Obama because he's raised the highest hopes. A senior Latin American diplomat told me, \"Look, we're all watching Obama with bated breath and hoping [his election] will be a transforming moment for the world. But now that we're listening to him on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>  --  the issue that affects us so deeply  --  we realize that maybe he doesn't wish us well. In fact, we might find ourselves nostalgic for Bush, who is brave and courageous on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and immigration.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact is, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been pivotal in transforming Mexico into a stable democracy with a growing economy. And, in Lawrence Summers's words, it \"didn't cost the United States a penny. It contributed to the strength of our economy because of more exports and because imports helped to reduce inflation.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> among the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries has boomed since 1993, growing by about $700 billion. No serious economists or experts believe that low wages in Mexico, China or India is the fundamental reason American factories close. And labor and environmental standards would do little to change the reality of huge wage differentials between poor and rich countries' workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The candidates' supporters often argue that they don't really mean what they say, that their proposals on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements involve only minor tinkering. It is an odd defense of candidates promising change, honesty and a new approach to politics to say that they are being cynical and hypocritical. Besides, Obama and Clinton propose renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which is a terrible idea. (And one that has prompted Canada's prime minister to retort that if that happens, his country would like to get more concessions from the United States.) Clinton also has proposed that free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals be reevaluated every five years, which is absurd. The benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals lie in their permanence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both candidates surely know that it is their general attitude and rhetoric, not their policy papers, that matter. On this crucial topic they are pandering to Americans' worst instincts, encouraging a form of xenophobia and chauvinism and validating the utterly self-defeating idea of protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I know, I know. This is all about the Democratic primaries in states such as Ohio and about union support. But you can't target messages so easily anymore. What is said in Ohio is heard in Ghana, Bangladesh and Colombia. And isn't the point of leadership to educate and elevate people, not to pander and drag them into the swamp of ignorance and fear? There is a way to speak about the pain of globalization  --  and about the need for investments in retraining, education, health care and infrastructure  --  so that we can compete but also absorb the shocks of a changing economy. Unfortunately, that is not what the Democratic candidates are talking about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm not even sure that protectionist rhetoric works that well in a general election. Americans like optimists. Railing against Mexicans, Chinese and Indians for stealing American jobs smacks of anger, paranoia and fear of the future. Americans want hope, as Obama says, \"hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.\" Where is that courage now?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is editor of Newsweek International and co-host of PostGlobal, an online discussion of international issues.

Adherence to an agreed set of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules and support for the W.T.O. dispute settlement mechanism encourages nondiscrimination, transparency and rule of law, which contribute to increased stability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Doha negotiations broke down in 2005 and have made little progress since. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> commentators are declaring Doha dead and multilateral negotiations obsolete as governments increasingly have turned to negotiating bilateral and regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that create conflicting rules and distort <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> by creating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> preferences for the signatories at the expense of those that do not participate. There is legitimate concern that the proliferation of bilateral and regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements could render the W.T.O. irrelevant and destroy the enormous benefits we derive from our multilateral trading system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could bring the 159 W.T.O. members back to the table?

In June 1991 the United States, Mexico and Canada launched the negotiations of a North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). Fourteen months later negotiations were concluded. President George H.W.

It was the first comprehensive free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement to join developed and developing nations, and it achieved broader and deeper <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization than any prior <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The world\u2019s reaction was broad, deep and fast. In just a few months following the passage of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators returned to the bargaining table, completed the Uruguay Round, and created the W.T.O. to the enormous benefit of the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If we are to repeat the success of two decades ago, we will require an even greater catalyst: a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement of such quality and scope that the rest of the world is galvanized.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trans-Atlantic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Investment Partnership recently announced by the European Union and the United States could be that catalyst.

The E.U. and the U.S. each recently concludedfree <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with South Korea that could serve as a template upon which to build.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposed Trans-Atlantic Partnership could have even more heft if Canada and Mexico were added \u2014 which makes sense, since Mexico already has a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the E.U., and Canada is in the final stages of negotiating one.

{"id": "1682223963.xml", "text": "<h2>Free Trade Is Not the Enemy</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CORRECTION APPENDED. CHICAGO -- IN 1993, President Bill Clinton tapped me as special counsel to lead the fight to pass the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. As a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> debate rages in Washington, I've thought a lot about that effort. The mistake we made in the 1990s was overestimating the potential of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s positive impact. Today, we are making the mistake of underestimating what defeat of the Asia-Pacific deal would mean economically, globally and politically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, America was on the precipice of great change. In plain view was the collapse of the Soviet empire, the further liberalization of China's economy and the intensification of international efforts to integrate economies worldwide. On the horizon was a technological revolution to rival any we had known. In 1993, the Internet was made up of just 130 websites. President Clinton, who felt that a party that embraced the future would always win out over one that shrank from it, firmly believed that adopting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was in the best interest of the nation, the middle class and the Democratic Party. So we muscled the agreement through Congress over fierce Democratic opposition.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic impact of the deal was immediately undercut by the collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994. But opponents' predictions of \"a giant sucking sound\" accompanying the departure of millions of jobs from American workers never materialized, either. From <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s ratification through the end of President Clinton's final year in 2000, America added over 20 million jobs, including more than 300,000 in manufacturing. When the manufacturing decline began in earnest in 2001, the main culprits were the offshoring of jobs to China, with which we have no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, and automation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now Congress is set to weigh in on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which encompasses 12 nations on four continents and dwarfs <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in economic size and geopolitical importance. Once again, the debate takes place while we are in the midst of great change -- a prolonged period of slow economic growth in the United States, China's re-emergence as a regional power, and a new economic order in which the developing countries of the world produce more goods and services than North America, Europe and Japan combined. Many on the political left and right oppose the liberalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy, just as they did during the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate, arguing instead for protectionist measures. But they're off-base.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no path to middle-class prosperity without tearing down barriers to American exports. By 2030, the world economy is expected to grow by $60 trillion, with almost 90 percent of the growth occurring outside the United States. Our success depends on how much of that new wealth is spent on American products. But today, of the 40 largest economies, the United States ranks 39th in the share of our gross domestic product that comes from exports. This is because our products face very high barriers to entry overseas in the form of tariffs, quotas and outright discrimination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When barriers disappear, we prosper. In the 17 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals the United States has concluded since 2000, our balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the blue-collar-goods sector went from minus $3 billion to plus $31 billion, according to an analysis of government data by the centrist policy institute Third Way, on whose board I sit. According to the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Administration, export-related jobs pay 18 percent more than similar jobs in the same sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Geopolitically, President Obama is also right. If we don't set the rules for commerce in the Asia-Pacific region, China will. Since 2000, China has concluded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with 23 countries, Hong Kong and Macau and is now drafting its own Asia <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal that cuts us out. This deal apparently omits any mention of labor rights and environmental standards common in modern American-led deals. It would keep many of the region's economies relying on the same substandard factory floor conditions that China and other Asian nations used to become manufacturing giants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if the TPP passes, the poorer countries in the pact will have to conform more to the standards of the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada -- all signatories to the proposed deal. The need for the China-led agreement disappears, and China's economic fortunes will be tied to joining our alliance, which would necessitate raising its standards on labor conditions, the environment and the rule of law.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, there is the question of politics. Denying the president the authority to negotiate an agreement to bring before Congress would be a serious rebuke. With much of the opposition coming from his own party, it would tell the nation that Democrats had lost confidence in the economic leadership of the man who steered us out of a near-depression. In effect, Mr. Obama's own party would be stripping him of the same ability to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that every president since F.D.R., except for Richard M. Nixon, has enjoyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s shadow hangs over this deal, but the truth is that both its upside and its downside are smaller than anyone likes to admit. Now we have a chance to guide a huge section of the world's economy to reflect our own high standards for commerce. Why would we deny the president the opportunity to seize this moment?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Correction:  May 21, 2015, Thursday</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Tuesday incorrectly described South Korea's involvement with the Trans-Pacific Partnership; it is not a signatory to the proposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WILLIAM M.

{"id": "1983204428.xml", "text": "<h2>Free Trade Has Been a Boon for Energy Independence</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As turbulent as Donald Trump's political career has been thus far, he has always been consistent about two things: First, that the U.S. should aggressively pursue energy independence; second, that the U.S. is getting short shrift on its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, including the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the administration moves to modernize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, however, it should remember that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico is vital to securing America's energy independence in the long run.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North America now leads the world in energy production, largely because the U.S. has become the No.1 producer of crude oil and natural gas. This outcome was by no means obvious when <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> became law in 1993. But by creating a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone for energy, the agreement helped all three countries' energy sectors flourish.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2016 the three North American economies produced a total of 22 million barrels a day of crude oil, associated liquids and biofuels, according to the Energy Information Administration, with 14.9 million barrels coming from the U.S. Saudi Arabia produced 12.4 million barrels a day and Russia 11.2 million. The fourth-largest producer, China, has less than half of Russia's production.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it comes to natural gas, the numbers are even more skewed toward the U.S., which produced 27.1 trillion cubic feet in 2015 compared with Russia's 21.1 trillion. Third-ranked Iran extracts one-quarter of what the U.S. produced. Canada comes in fifth, after Qatar. Altogether, North America produced about 33.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But these solid figures, dominated by U.S. production, should not obscure an important point: Each of the three North American economies, and its energy sector, depends on the other two.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada and Mexico need the U.S. to buy their excess crude oil, and the U.S. needs its neighbors to cover its own shortfall. According to the EIA, the U.S. consumes about six million more barrels of crude oil and related products a day than it produces. The U.S. imports about three million barrels a day from Canada, its largest energy trading partner. Although total Mexican crude-oil production has been declining, Mexico still exports about 688,000 barrels a day to the U.S. With U.S. technology and investment, Mexican production and exports could be significantly higher -- perhaps enough, together with Canada, to close the U.S. gap.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada depends heavily on U.S. refineries, especially in the Midwest and on the Gulf Coast, which specialize in processing Canada's heavy crude. Mexico also depends on the U.S. to refine its crude, which Mexico buys back as gasoline and diesel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another important result of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that more natural-gas pipelines are being built so the U.S. can help Mexico turn to cleaner-burning natural gas for its electricity generation. In 2016 the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico was $8.7 billion, while U.S. energy exports to Mexico were $20.2 billion, for a positive energy <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus of $11.5 billion, according to the EIA. While most economists don't put much stock in international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances, the Trump administration cares a lot about them, and under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> the U.S. energy sector has a positive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s elimination of virtually all tariffs on energy-related goods has greatly enhanced North America's energy potential, but there is still room for improvement. A modernized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should include a labor provision that allows workers in the oil and gas industry to travel to any of the three countries, especially in emergencies. Mexico needs U.S. technology and assistance to modernize and expand its energy sector, while the U.S. might need more workers in oil fields in places like West Texas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A modernized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should also recognize the threat that could emerge for North America if other major energy exporters tried to punish the U.S. for its foreign policies.

{"id": "398725498.xml", "text": "<h2>Fruit of the lobbyist</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the myths of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that it pits workers (opposed) against big business (in favor). But it's more often true that the worst protectionists are businesses looking out for their own self-interest and using workers as political cover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is what seems to be happening in Washington now in a behind-the-scenes battle to extend lower <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tariff rates to nearly 30 tiny countries in the Caribbean. The protectionist condominium of the AFL-CIO and Pat Buchanan oppose it in the name of American \"jobs.\" But the real power blocking this proposal is a big, politically connected U.S. underwear maker, Fruit of the Loom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This story goes back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan proposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefits to the Caribbean as a way to promote prosperity in our own backyard. Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Dominica, among others, are some of the poorest nations in the world. The thinking was that more jobs at better pay would deter communism in the region, not to mention deterring illegal immigrant landings in Florida. Then a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, Mr. Buchanan was a supporter, and a Democratic Congress passed the Caribbean Basin Initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem now is that these countries have been unintended victims of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which removed just about all tariffs and import quotas from Mexico. All of a sudden clothing became from 10% to 40% less expensive to produce in Mexico than in the Caribbean, which still faces some U.S. import duties. The idea of \"CBI parity\" is to level the playing field once more in the Western hemisphere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This should be politically easy. The Clinton Administration is for it, albeit in its diffident way. So are GOP leaders Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, and Congressmen as ideologically diverse as Phil Crane and Charlie Rangel. Bill Archer's Ways and Means Committee put the provision into the House version of the tax bill, which makes sense since the tariff cut amounts to a tax cut. Even much of the normally protectionist apparel and textile industry likes the idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The big exception is Fruit of the Loom, which our sources say is fighting a furious cloakroom battle to remove CBI parity from the tax bill in House-Senate conference. Fruit fears that it'll be at a competitive disadvantage to other American textile makers that already have more operations based in the Caribbean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fruit CEO William Farley is no political fool. His chief lobbyist is former U.S. textile negotiator Ron Sorini. Remember how Ross Perot and others deplored the \"revolving door\" of foreign companies hiring U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> officials? The reality is that domestic companies do similar hiring. Mr. Farley also understands the leverage of political contributions. Before the GOP took Congress in 1994, he was a big donor to Democrats. Since then he's tended to favor Republicans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fruit claims it wants to protect American jobs, but there's one large catch: It plans to move those jobs out of the U.S. anyway, CBI parity or no. This is what Fruit itself tells Wall Street. A November 7, 1996, investor report by J.P. Morgan makes the point: \"Fruit's offshore migration was the major catalyst for the gross profit jump. By year-end, 55% to 60% of Fruit's production will be handled offshore, well exceeding its original 45% target. Fruit plans migration to reach 70% to 80% by year-end 1997, enabling the company to sustain gross margins in the 31% to 32% range.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this should be a surprise. In 1995, our sources told us at the time, Mr. Farley told Speaker Gingrich that if CBI parity became law Fruit would have to shut down plants in Louisiana and Kentucky, which were holding competitive elections for governor that year. The bill was then pulled from the budget. But lo, Fruit closed some of its plants anyway -- just as it promised investors, if not politicians.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Sorini insists Fruit doesn't oppose extending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, but disapproves of doing so \"unilaterally\" -- as if these tiny countries have to be treated like, say, Japan. He also says Fruit would settle for a compromise that gave CBI parity only for fabric made in the U.S., but this would still benefit Fruit more than other companies, because it is one of the largest U.S. fabric makers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our view is that Mr. Farley can put his plants anywhere he likes, but he shouldn't try to use his clout with politicians to carve out exceptions that benefit him, or prevent tariff cuts that benefit millions. While CBI parity would cost some sewing jobs that would leave the U.S. anyway, it would also create more jobs in other areas. The Gulf ports would see a boom in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that might otherwise head to Asia. U.S. apparel makers would be more competitive with the rest of the world, not less, because they'd have more lower-cost suppliers at closer distances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pat Buchanan and the boys at the AFL-CIO might start thinking about these workers, lest they be conned right out of their BVDs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> and Textiles\" -- WSJ Aug. 21, 1997)</p>\n"}

At their Ohio debate on Tuesday, first Mrs. Clinton, followed ever so quickly by Mr. Obama, pledged to pull America out of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement if the two countries don't agree to rewrite it on Yankee terms. How's that for global \"unilateralism\"?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats sure have come a long way from the 1990s, when Bill Clinton pushed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> through a Democratic Congress. And the truth is that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have spoken favorably about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the past. Yet now they are sounding the loudest protectionist notes by a potential President in decades. More dangerous, neither is telling the truth about the role of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the U.S. economy. If either one makes it to the White House, he or she will carry the weight of this campaign protectionism while trying to lead the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While it is politically incorrect to say so, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good for all of North America. By opening the continent to investment and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, capital has found more efficient uses, with benefits to producers and consumers alike. In <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s first decade after 1993, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the U.S. and Mexico multiplied to $232 billion from $81 billion. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> with Canada has also blossomed, with Canadian exports to the U.S. by surface transport rising 79% in a decade and U.S. exports to Canada increasing 38%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The deal also increased U.S. productivity. U.S. firms found they could be more globally competitive by putting some manufacturing in Mexico or Canada while retaining high-end production in the U.S. This has resulted in what John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, has called \"the highly integrated North American industrial base, particularly between Canada and the U.S.\" Such flexibility may have saved thousands of U.S. jobs from going abroad. In the first 10 years of the deal, the U.S. economy added 18 million jobs and the jobless rate sank to record lows.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has also been crucial to Mexico's continuing development. After the 1994 peso devaluation, the political left in Mexico had all the ammunition it needed to turn back liberalization. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> made that difficult. In the two presidential elections since the 1994-1995 peso crisis, Mexicans have voted for a modern economy. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has helped Mexico develop strong retail competition for the first time and allowed the economy to diversify beyond oil. Other gains include greater transparency in Mexico's fiscal accounts, an independent central bank and an inflation rate that is now lower than in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this counts with Mr. Obama, who is whacking Mrs. Clinton for saying in 2004 that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had been good for New York state and the country. He also points out that \"in her own book Senator Clinton called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 'one of Bill's successes.'\" Instead of defending the economic record of the 1990s, Mrs. Clinton's response has been to call for a \"time out\" on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, as if the world won't build new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs without America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Illinois Senator is less than honest about his own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> history. In his race for his Senate seat in 2004, he told Illinois farmers that the U.S. benefits from exports under the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and he recommended that the U.S. go after more deals like it. He also discouraged protectionism, warning that \"as an exporting state, Illinois would be hurt by a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war sparked by tariffs. This would be particularly devastating to our agricultural economy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that was when he was trying to appeal to farmers who rely on exports. Now that he's battling for union endorsements, Mr. Obama says he \"would immediately call the president of Mexico, the president of Canada [we presume he meant the prime minister], to try to amend <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, because I think that we can get labor agreements in that agreement right now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he doesn't mention is that our trading partners might not want to reopen a pact that the U.S. hasn't yet even fully implemented, as in the failure to allow Mexican trucks onto U.S. highways. The Teamsters, who endorsed Mr. Obama last week, have blocked that one. Mexico and Canada may also want to protect more of their agricultural markets in return for \"labor agreements,\" harming U.S. farmers or other efficient U.S. exporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Democratic contest continues, it is becoming a race to the bottom on protectionism. Perhaps the best <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> demagogue will win, but someone should point out that the last President who tried to govern as a protectionist was Herbert Hoover.

It's how economies grow.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet our political class and intellectuals increasingly point to these developments -- technology, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and migration -- as reasons for pessimism. It is worrisome logic because it suggests that a better future depends on going backward, against the grain of economic liberalism. It also ignores the Fed's culpability for slow growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Innovation and competition generate what Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction.\" In a free market with sound money, the wealth created by disruption is redeployed, providing opportunities for those who were displaced. This boosts productivity further.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fed policies of zero interest rates and bond buying -- quantitative easing -- have not only failed to stimulate business investment. They have discouraged it through the misallocation of capital. This is contractionary because it starves entrepreneurship and thus productivity growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) opened the Mexican economy to Canadian and U.S. imports in 1994. Many Mexicans lost jobs. Yet the country gained access to what it needed to modernize. Running water, salmon entrees, California wines and air conditioning were not standard fare here on the Mayan Riviera in 1985. They are now, and tourism has boomed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talk about the need for faster U.S. growth.

Both prescribe new restrictions on international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and a new entitlement program for preschool children.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton wants government to take a bigger tax bite from the most productive members of society, a policy that would discourage risk-taking by those same individuals.

Mr. Trump argued in September that the Fed's eight-year policy of cheap credit is generating asset bubbles. But if he understood the problem he wouldn't rail against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mrs. Clinton feigns alarm at Mr. Trump's criticism of the Fed on grounds that the central bank is supposed to be independent.

Yet when the Fed buys assets -- such as government debt or mortgage-backed securities -- it only records a short-term liability on the balance sheet. The reserves are on the books but don't create any more credit in the real economy than if the Fed never made the purchase. Meanwhile it creates shortages of medium- and long-term assets in the market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If there were a glut of credit in the real economy it would likely show up in bank lending as expanding businesses clamored for low-cost loans. Yet credit growth \"has been dismally slow,\" wrote David Malpass, president of the consulting firm Encima Global in a recent note to clients. The term structure of bank assets is partly to blame, but so is regulation -- by the Fed and Congress, via 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation -- which has made it difficult to lend to businesses, especially small ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most creditworthy companies are using cheap money not in productivity-increasing ventures but to pay dividends, buy back stock or engage in other financial transactions.

But it\u2019s better than the status quo, and better than any plausible alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting off approval until 2020 would make Democrats complicit in the needless <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> uncertainty that Trump has created.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His tariff policies in particular discourage investment and hiring, and make business planning far more difficult than it should be. Leaving USMCA on the shelf also could provoke the mercurial president to simply abandon <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a step that would create chaos in the North American marketplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American farmers, whose net farm income has plunged by 50% since 2013, have enough trouble lately with bad weather and low prices. They don\u2019t need the additional stress of wondering whether they\u2019ll be able to sell to Mexico and Canada \u2014 which together bought $2.8 billion worth of Illinois\u2019 agricultural goods last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>USMCA also would help Midwest factory workers \u2014 and increase their numbers. The Washington Post reports that: Automakers would face the biggest changes once the new agreement takes effect. The USMCA requires more made-in-the-USA content and mandates that 40% of each vehicle be produced by workers earning $16 per hour \u2014 a provision that is likely to draw jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi\u2019s delay in advancing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal invites Republican criticism that the Democratic-controlled House is too obsessed with impeachment to take care of other matters that have a more direct bearing on the lives of most Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi has insisted that her members \u201ccan walk and chew gum.\u201d But right now it looks as though they are forfeiting an easy achievement in their pursuit of something unattainable \u2014 Trump\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis by the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission, an independent federal agency, concluded that it would stimulate economic growth and job creation across \u201call broad industry sectors within the U.S. economy.\u201d The total yield, by the agency\u2019s calculation: a $68.2 billion increase in gross domestic product and 176,000 additional jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, Trump and Pelosi were sniping at each other: Trump complained to news reporters that the USMCA was \u201csitting on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s desk.\u201d The speaker retorted that she\u2019s awaiting some final decisions from Trump\u2019s U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe so. Maybe, too, she could ask one of her staffers to get final answers. Fifteen months after Trump cut this deal, all those Midwest farmers and factory workers aren\u2019t looking for House Democrats\u2019 excuses. They\u2019ve waited too long for a simple action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going into an election year, Democrats can look distracted by impeachment and inattentive to Americans\u2019 economic concerns.

{"id": "293479733.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade With Latin America: A Tale of Huge Numbers; The issue should be high on the Clinton agenda</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Three issues dominate current U.S. policy toward Latin America: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, drug trafficking and immigration. As President Clinton begins his second term, he would do well to give free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the Americas the highest priority. Numbers alone can provide a strong argument for that choice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to its southern neighbors have grown at a remarkable pace in recent years, even though there are still too many tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in Latin America. The value of those exports will exceed $100 billion in 1996. If this trend continues, the figure will rise to an staggering $240 billion annually by 2010, more than the current combined U.S. exports to Europe and Japan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An export-oriented economy means not just higher profits for U.S. businesses but more jobs and better pay for American workers. Manufacture and exports of goods like electrical appliances, industrial machinery and automobiles require skilled labor that demands the highest wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration should take the lead in the move toward full regional economic integration. At the Miami Summit of the Americas in December 1994, the president proposed establishing a hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone by 2005. The Mexican financial crisis later that month all but scuttled that recommendation, and this year's U.S. presidential campaign gave rise to a few voices from America's protectionist past, casting another shadow over the idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Clinton would serve this country and its hemispheric neighbors well by picking up the banner of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> again. Mexico is climbing back to its feet, edging toward economic recovery--an accomplishment that should be credited in part to the strong foundation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Safely reelected, Clinton could turn his attention to accepting an eager Chile under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tent, bolstering the strength and stretch of the alliance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obviously the White House cannot achieve this independently. Congress should grant the president so-called \"fast track\" authority to negotiate a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Chile. In July, the president must send Congress a report on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s progress. There will be no better opportunity to try to convince remaining doubters of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> alliance that the payoff for the United States is potentially high, both in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and developing a competitive edge for the global economy as a whole.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is not to argue that the other issues on Clinton's Latin American agenda are unimportant. But the emotional matters of drug trafficking and illegal immigration should not be allowed to become irritants to progress on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, which, ultimately, can improve Latin American economies and thus diminish the pressures that drive these two problems. Some would argue that an economic boom south of the U.S. border would keep at home many job seekers who otherwise would illegally enter this country. It also might even convince some peasants that growing opium poppies, marijuana and coca is not worth the risk when weighed against the legal benefits of improved economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S.-Latin <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> figures for 1995, in billions:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exp.

{"id": "1963828707.xml", "text": "<h2>Yes, Nafta Is Good for My Children</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This week American, Canadian and Mexican negotiators will meet in Mexico City for the fifth round of talks to modernize the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. During the previous round of negotiations in Washington, I had the opportunity to meet with U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer, who leads the U.S. delegation. I wanted to explain how important <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is to my company and the communities we serve.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Near the end of our meeting, Mr. Lighthizer asked me a more personal question: \"How is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> good for your children and grandchildren?\" Afterward, I spent a good deal of time thinking about this. I also took the time to consider how this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal will affect America's place in the world for decades to come. I think I can now give a definitive answer to Mr. Lighthizer's question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, what does <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> mean to contemporary society? U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico support 14 million American jobs, including tens of thousands in every state, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Each day, more than $3.3 billion is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. That's $1.2 trillion a year. In fact, about half of all Canadian and Mexican imports are made in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is especially beneficial for America's farmers and ranchers. Agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico -- vital to the health and strength of rural America's economy -- have quadrupled to $38 billion in 2016 from $8.9 billion in 1993, according to the North American Economic Alliance. Canada and Mexico are also the top two markets in the world for U.S.-made manufactured goods, with purchases of nearly $500 billion last year, a sum that tops the next 10 largest markets combined.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's North American neighbors are also booming markets for U.S. services exports. In 2016 the U.S. recorded a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus of $11.9 billion with its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners when manufactured goods and services are combined, data from the Chamber of Commerce show. Among the biggest beneficiaries of this commerce are America's small and medium-size businesses. Some 125,000 of them sell their goods and services to Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's what the world looks like with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. What if it went away?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exports to Mexico and Canada could face tariffs and taxes, meaning that over time American exports would be replaced by products from other markets. Mexican purchases of corn and other agricultural commodities from the U.S. would almost certainly shift to places like Argentina, Brazil and the European Union. Given its concerns over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico is actively pursuing new free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to facilitate this. A recent study by Impact Econ estimates that more than a million U.S. jobs could be lost if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ends.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress is trying to overhaul the tax code to boost the economy and help wages grow. But if the White House pulls out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it could lead to the reimposition of higher tariffs on North American-produced goods. This would effectively be a big tax increase on all U.S. production.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I recently attended a business summit featuring high-profile Mexican business and government leaders, including President Enrique Pena Nieto. Chinese and Russian government officials and business leaders participated too, hoping to strengthen <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Mexico -- and put at risk the $600 billion of goods that Mexico purchases from the U.S. It was a chilling reminder that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s collapse would push Mexico, and perhaps Canada, to look elsewhere to stabilize their economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for Mr. Lighthizer's thought-provoking question: I'm confident my three daughters and future grandchildren are better off because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. And a modernized agreement could help more. I believe the ambassador and President Trump can achieve that objective for all of us, and I want to help them do so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Ottensmeyer is CEO of Kansas City Southern, a railroad company with operations in the U.S., Mexico and Panama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Patrick J.

{"id": "1197126845.xml", "text": "<h2>A Mexican partner in prosperity</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both Mexico and the United States held presidential races this year, and the results offer an opportunity to redirect our countries' bilateral relationship. The U.S. election demonstrated the growing demographic bonds that connect our countries' futures. The election in Mexico heralded a new era of change and reform, as much as a new style of governing, based on pragmatism and results.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To build a more prosperous future for our two countries, we must continue strengthening and expanding our deep economic, social and cultural ties. It is a mistake to limit our bilateral relationship to drugs and security concerns. Our mutual interests are too vast and complex to be restricted in this short-sighted way. When I meet with President Obama on Tuesday - just days before my inauguration - I want to discuss the best way to rearrange our common priorities. After all, our agenda affects millions of citizens in both countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps the most important issue is finding new ways to bolster our economic and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship to attain common prosperity in our nations. The United States is already Mexico's largest trading partner. As a result of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>), our economic ties have grown to an unprecedented degree. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> links 441 million people producing trillions of dollars in goods and services annually, making it the largest trading bloc in the world. Consequently, in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> we have a solid foundation to further integrate our economies through greater investments in finance, infrastructure, manufacturing and energy. Together, we must build a more competitive and productive region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another relevant bilateral issue relates to Mexico's status as an increasingly desirable and dependable manufacturing location. My country is the second-largest supplier of electronic goods to the United States. Coca-Cola, DuPont, GM, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Audi and many others are seizing the opportunity to manufacture within our borders. We seek to continue offering U.S. consumers better products and better prices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Energy production is another emerging area that can enhance our nations' potential. I plan to open Mexico's energy sector to national and foreign private investment. Mexico holds the fifth-largest shale gas reserve in the world, in addition to large deep-water oil reserves and a tremendous potential in renewable energy. We will not surrender Mexico's ownership over its energy resources, and we will not privatize our state-run oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). We will, however, welcome new technologies, new partnerships and new investments. Together with the United States and Canada, this may well contribute to guaranteeing North American energy independence - something from which we would all greatly benefit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Above all, our mutual interest lies in our intertwined peoples. More than 1 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico, and my country remains the largest source of immigrants to the United States. Some analysts detect new momentum for comprehensive immigration reform since the U.S. presidential election. All Mexicans would welcome such a development.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both of our nations are seriously affected by organized-crime activities and drug trafficking. Working against them must be a shared responsibility. I will continue the efforts begun by President Felipe Calderon, but the strategy must necessarily change. I set as a public goal slashing violent crime significantly, proposing a sizable increase in security spending and doing away with redundant police levels. I will improve coordination among crime-fighting authorities, expand the federal police by at least 35,000 officers and bolster intelligence-gathering and analysis. It is also important that our countries increase intelligence-sharing and crime-fighting techniques and promote cooperation among law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am visiting Washington and President Obama because our nations share a long-standing and important relationship. The 2012 elections mark the beginning of a new era for the United States and Mexico. This is a great time to join efforts and capitalize on that momentum. We must build a more prosperous North America, on the basis of an alliance for a further competitive and productive integration of our economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is president-elect of Mexico.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1678046290.xml", "text": "<h2>Exorcising NAFTA's ghosts (Posted 2015-05-04 00:02:00)</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As President Obama makes the case for expansive new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, he has had to contend with the vexing image of the last big <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal debated in the national spotlight, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. In the perception of some Americans, including a significant number of Democrats, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a cautionary tale, invoked today as a warning that similar deals will harm the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is unfortunate on two counts. First, comparing the substance of current negotiations to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, an agreement reached at the end of the Cold War and the dawn of globalization, is like comparing the latest smartphone to an early Macintosh desktop. The 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement being hammered out by the administration is more sophisticated, comprehensive and user-friendly than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was in its day. It would also connect the United States to a much larger global network. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Michael Froman is negotiating a state-of-the-art agreement, and Obama has advanced persuasive arguments for both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority he needs to seal the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s legacy is more positive and instructive than its ardent critics recognize. Reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to a caricature obscures both its achievements and some valuable lessons -- good and bad. As part of the White House team that helped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> become a reality, I think its record over the past 20 years can contribute to the current debate and to larger questions about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the United States's role in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which was negotiated under President George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, united the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Today, Canada is our largest export market and Mexico is the second largest. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> in North America has increased by 400 percent, passing $1.1 trillion per year. More U.S. exports go to Mexico than to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain combined. We export more to Canada than to the European Union.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The successes went well beyond the balance sheet, however. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted U.S. security and regional stability. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is a powerful instrument of geopolitics, binding us to our allies. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> smoothed more than a century of friction in U.S.-Mexico relations. It was a catalyst for opening Mexico's economy and its political system; within a decade, the country ended generations of one-party rule. Mexico is today undertaking reforms that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. The success of a North American platform in energy and manufacturing has yielded diplomatic and security cooperation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> cemented ties with our neighbors and showed that the United States would not turn inward after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Trans-Pacific Partnership can be an essential bonding agent in our relations in Asia. It is a crucial sign of our engagement with a region where China seeks to assert more influence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sharpest criticism of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is that it caused U.S. job losses and lower wages, a concern painfully reflected in the hardship of workers who saw jobs go overseas. The rise of the global economy, advances in technology and other factors have transformed the American workplace. How big was <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s role? Economists disagree. Assessing its overall economic impact, a report last month by the Congressional Research Service issued a split decision: \"In reality, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, despite significant growth, does remain a relatively small part of the total U.S. economy. Still, evidence suggests net job creation and more high-wage jobs created in the process. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, around 14 million U.S. jobs depend on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Canada and Mexico, with nearly 5 million of those jobs due to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> increase generated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disruptive power of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a reality we can't ignore. It brings benefits and costs. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> helps keep inflation and consumer prices low. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> boosted productivity through competition. On jobs, the lessons of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argue for a holistic approach to education and training assistance for employees along with infrastructure and other investment. The profits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must flow not only to shareholders but also to workers. Notably, agreements in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on labor and the environment were handled in \"side letters\" drafted after negotiations. Now, they are being baked into the deal-making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a rare bipartisan triumph. Congress approved the measure with a Republican majority and more than 100 Democratic votes after exhaustive persuasion by Clinton. \"It's never fun passing a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill in this town,\" Obama said last week. But it is a critical test of leadership for both the president and the country. As in 1993, bipartisan support is needed not just to muster enough votes.

Use him as a guide to make an about-face. Implore a foreign leader to exclude members of Congress from their countries? Wrong. Insist that they be let in. Pull out of the Paris accords? No. Use our leverage to increase compliance by other countries and develop the best green technology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's not just me. Under Trump, Americans have learned to love the Affordable Care Act (which Trump sought to destroy), have taken the side of \"dreamers\" (whom Trump holds hostage) and have finally figured out that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is a good thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll finds: \"Amid President Donald Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war with China, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they support free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with foreign countries. ... That represents a new high in the NBC/WSJ survey on this question, and it's a 7-point increase from the last time it was asked in 2017.\" Only 27 percent think free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is bad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That should serve as a warning to lawmakers of both parties and Democratic presidential candidates. It's good policy and good politics to support opening markets for our farmers and businesses and giving our consumers access to the best goods at the lowest prices. In fact, \"The percentage of those favoring free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is up 13 points from 2015 and 7 points from 2017, with Democrats and independents much more supportive than they were four years ago.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democratic politicians who say TPP was a bad idea (although it would have put China in a box and greatly improved our negotiating position on items such as intellectual property, not to mention boosting our strategic alliances in the region) sound very 2015. When they reflexively reject <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 and bad-mouth the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with a a vague and unsupported claim that it costs jobs, they sound like Trump. In other words, they sound economically illiterate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, it's perfectly fine to insist that we give generous support to workers who have been displaced by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. (Getting them ready for the real threat, automation, would be a good idea.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We must also aggressively enforce international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules that prohibit dumping and phony invocation of national security protections (just as Trump is doing). But the notion that we have more leverage to negotiate environmental protections when we renege on agreements or wage tariff wars is Trump-level dumb.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements must include certain core labor protections. And we have done so, as the Atlantic has noted:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In response to complaints about the lack of labor rights in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, Congress came up in 2007 with the May 10th agreement, a bipartisan compromise aimed at ensuring that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> partners were actually working to improve labor conditions. It required that member countries adopt and enforce the basic labor standards set in the 1988 Declaration of the International Labor Organization. It also made labor disputes subject to the same settlement procedures as commercial <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes, meaning that countries that violated labor rules could be subject to sanctions. May 10th required the U.S. to hold countries more accountable for labor standards\u2014Congress did not vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements negotiated with Peru, Colombia, and Panama until those countries had changed their labor laws.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is plenty of room to argue for greater specificity in the agreements and better enforcement mechanisms. But arguing that workers around the globe are better off without such protections is daft. As Vox reported, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 \"includes several labor rules meant to benefit workers on both sides of the border. For example, Mexico has agreed to pass a law giving workers the right to real union representation, and to adopt other labor laws that meet international standards set forth by the United Nations. American auto companies that assemble their cars in Mexico would also need to use more US-made car parts to avoid tariffs, which would help US factory workers. And about 40 percent of those cars would need to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.\" The problem arises in getting Mexico to enforce these rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Democrats want to sound really smart, they would start saying things like \"I'm for TPP and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 so that we can sell American goods and services. But we must nail down the worker protections, maybe agree to spot-audits or other mechanisms so that poverty-wage workers aren't undercutting our own workers. And <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adjustment benefits have to be a whole lot more generous and effective.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In short, Democrats need to stop pandering on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and sounding Trumpian. Tout the benefits of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, give a few concrete examples as to how to improve worker and environmental protections and bash Trump for not seizing opportunities to put China back on its heels (e.g. enter TPP, which excluded China). Alternatively, they can sound like Trump and inveigh against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals based on the irrelevant criteria of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits. They would be in a much better position to skewer Trump on his recession-inducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> antics if their own position on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rested on firmer economic ground.</p>\n"}

But true to their mindset as a 40-year minority, House Republicans may yet try to resurrect the billionaire bully.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do Republicans want Mr. Perot to continue to be a force in American politics? Do they relish, in 1996, a replay of 1992? Or maybe the Bush debacle wasn't enough, and they're looking for a catastrophe of the magnitude that struck the Canadian Tories last month? If so, House Republicans should defeat the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, restore Mr. Perot's reputation for clout, and risk splitting their voter coalition down the middle. Go ahead, re-elect Bill Clinton!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If this seems harsh, it only fits the Perot-chialism that is afflicting House Republicans on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. After Mr. Gore's smiling dissection of Boss Ross, President Clinton is almost certain to get 100 House Democrats to support the accord. But despite the best efforts of leaders Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Dick Armey (Texas), the GOP rank and file are now balking at providing the 120 votes that should be their side of the bargain. Republicans who think a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> loss will tarnish only Democrats may want to think again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican excuses are about as deep as Mr. Perot's economic logic. Take John Doolittle, a second-termer from Northern California who supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as negotiated by George Bush. \"I'm committed to the ideal of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" he told the Sacramento Bee, but, after \"painstaking analysis,\" he now opposes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because the side agreements negotiated by Mr. Clinton somehow threaten U.S. \"sovereignty\" by giving power to international bureaucrats. More likely, the only thing Mr. Doolittle has analyzed is the fact that Mr. Perot won 25% of the vote in his district last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This \"sovereignty\" line is popular among many Republicans, since it offers them a fig leaf of principle to cover their pusillanimity. They don't seem to care that this excuse, concocted by Mercedes-driving protectionist Pat Buchanan, has been debunked by such notorious left-wingers as the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Robert Bork.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ed Royce, a heretofore impressive freshman from Orange County, Calif., even mumbles about an American Maastricht, which refers to the big British fight over European integration. Yet Margaret Thatcher, who led the fight against Maastricht, has endorsed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Sorry, Mr. Royce: Pat Buchanan is no Denis Thatcher, much less a Maggie.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some Republicans seem bent on disproving the adage that \"an honest politician stays bought.\" Florida members balked at tariff reductions for citrus and vegetables, so Mr. Clinton cut some deals. Then they asked Mr. Clinton to quiet the Florida agriculture commissioner, which he did. Yet these Republicans are still holding out, and Tom Lewis, who holds the safe seat from Palm Beach, even called a press conference to assert that \"right now my vote is no,\" but that \"the door is ajar.\" What's really ajar is the door to his political brothel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other profiles in principle include two Cuban-Americans from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Their gripe is with Mexico's insufficient hostility toward Fidel Castro. Thus they've concluded that the blessings of economic liberty Cubans have enjoyed in America after 1959 shouldn't be shared with other Latinos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's Rick Santorum, the loud \"reformer\" from Pennsylvania. He's afraid that a yes vote will doom his 1994 run against Sen. Harris Wofford, as if he could ever outbid the Democrat as a protectionist. Dan Burton, from his safe (72%) Indiana seat, is shouting so loudly about how <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would hurt Midwest agriculture that he's making life difficult for his neighboring Republican, Steve Buyer, who wants to vote yes. Yet everyone who's studied the pact knows that Midwest farmers would do very well under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. And Fred Upton, a four-termer and Whirlpool heir from Michigan, isn't even a profile on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, though three GOP freshmen from that state will vote aye.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All of this is familiar and depressing, because it sounds so much like House Democrats. By refusing to stand up for what most claimed to believe only last year, House Republicans would only convince voters it makes no difference who is elected. Like the egregious Ed Rollins, who couldn't help boasting about his genius in electing Christie Whitman in New Jersey, Republicans would only reinforce voter cynicism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fear of Perot is understandable but overwrought, because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will hardly be the only issue contested in the 1994 elections. Are Perot voters really going to run third-party candidates, thus dividing the GOP vote and guaranteeing election of the same Democratic House majority? In any event, this possibility is diminished if Mr. Perot is diminished.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More broadly, a strong vote for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> keeps Republicans as a party of growth and optimism. It reaches out to new voters, especially Mexican-Americans, who have embraced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and who have shown increasing willingness to vote for Republicans. Henry Bonilla, a Republican who represents the Texas border, says \"you can't find housing in Laredo, the place is growing so fast.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Helping Mr. Clinton on this issue of principle also makes Republicans more credible when they want to oppose him on another, as with health care. By exposing Mr. Perot's intellectual pretense, Al Gore has raised the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> stakes for everyone. If <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> fails now, House Republicans will share the blame.</p>\n"}

The Senate and the Bush Administration are threatening sanctions or tariffs against China, while the GOP majority in Congress is having trouble mustering the votes to expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the poorest countries of Central America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'll save China for another day, but if Congress can't pass Cafta -- the Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement -- everyone will begin reassessing America's global economic leadership. A House vote is scheduled for May, and too many Members are running for cover, thanks especially to the sugar and textile lobbies. It's a sign of Washington's bizarro-world quality that two industries that together account for a fraction of U.S. GDP are nonetheless wagging the Beltway.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta would expand the market for U.S. goods with the 44 million consumers in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, as well as with the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. As it happens, thanks to earlier <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws, the U.S. market is already quite open to their goods. Nearly 80% of goods from the six Cafta countries currently enter the U.S. duty-free. Two-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was $31.9 billion in 2003, according to the Cato Institute, making the Cafta region America's 13th largest trading partner -- bigger than Brazil, Singapore or Australia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta would return the favor by eliminating most tariffs on U.S. exports to the region. On motor vehicles and parts, Cafta countries levy an average tariff of 11% while the U.S. rate is zero. On vegetables, fruits and nuts, the Cafta region's average is 16.7%, again compared with zero in the U.S. On grains, it is 10.6% to zero; and on meat products, it's 14.7% while the U.S. rate is 3%. Cafta would remove these disparities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One big winner under Cafta would be U.S. agriculture, which has seen its market share fall in the region as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have given preferential access to Canada, the European Union and South American countries. The average tariff on U.S. agricultural exports to the region is 11% and reaches as high as 150%, says the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that U.S. farm exports to the region -- $1.6 billion in 2003 -- would increase by $1.5 billion a year when Cafta is fully implemented. The winners would include the feed, potato, pork, grain, corn, milk, oilseed, soybean and meat industries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Cafta could still fail because of the opposition of the economically tiny, but politically gigantic, sugar industry. This is all the more astonishing when you consider how little sugar \"opening\" Cafta really allows. American sugar import quotas would rise by all of 1% of the U.S. market in the first year. After 15 long years of phased-in \"liberalization,\" sugar imports would rise to the magnificent level of 1.7%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oh -- and did we mention that the government price supports that keep U.S. sugar prices two and half times the world market would be preserved? The International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission forecasts that prices could decrease between 0.25% and 1.2%, estimates which the Grocery Manufacturers of America says \"are almost certainly overstated.\" And yet the U.S. sugar lobby -- a few families in Florida, Texas and Louisiana, plus sugar beet farmers in the Midwest -- can't tolerate even this much competition because it fears the political precedent. Big Sugar's Beltway clout is a bipartisan scandal that deserves a lot more media scrutiny.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, as ever there is the textile lobby, which wants it both ways on Cafta. On the one hand, Cafta will help some of the U.S. industry compete with China, especially by providing a market for American fabric. (Chinese garment makers typically use their own fabric.) At the same time, the textile lobby wants to block fabric makers in Mexico and Canada from selling cloth to Cafta countries for apparel that could then be exported duty-free to the U.S. The idea is to force Cafta apparel makers to buy U.S. fabric only. But if that happens, those same companies might simply move to China anyway, for lower costs and to avoid the hassle. In the end, that would cost even more U.S. fabric-making jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another familiar opponent is the AFL-CIO, which is putting special pressure on Democrats. So far only two House Democrats -- Henry Cuellar of Texas and William Jefferson of Louisiana -- have come out in favor of Cafta. One of Big Labor's objections is that Cafta merely requires the countries to enforce their own labor and environmental laws. It wants the U.S. to force them to abide by standards closer to our own -- as if the U.S. had the same standards when it was much poorer, and as if Congress would tolerate such foreign intrusion today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Cafta of course rhymes with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and it's worth remembering that the \"giant sucking sound\" that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> critics predicted 12 years ago never did happen. The U.S. economy has continued to prosper and create jobs, while more opportunities have been opened for Mexicans inside Mexico. If Cafta fails because Congress fears competition from El Salvador, imagine what they'll conclude in Beijing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: No Significant Job or Wage Loss Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>\" -- WSJ May 4, 2005)</p>\n"}
{"id": "429991236.xml", "text": "<h2>In Miami, Freer Trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The United States, Canada and 32 Latin American countries declared yesterday in Miami that they would create a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area by 2006 -- in effect, a larger version of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That represents a political victory for President Clinton and an economic victory for people throughout the hemisphere. By one estimate, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could raise income in Latin America by $500 per person -- a huge boost in countries racked by poverty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The summit meeting's declaration is credible. Compare it to a similar pledge by Asian-Pacific nations meeting last month in Indonesia. There, countries bowing to pressure from the U.S. announced a commitment to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but wavered by delaying a start date and taking no immediate steps to achieve their lofty goals. Some signatories backed away within hours of the declaration. Not so in Miami. The Latin American leaders pushed the U.S. to adopt an early target date for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. They also agreed to concrete steps to get negotiations under way.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The best evidence of their resolve can be found in the record of political and economic changes that have swept over Latin America. In 1967, the last time leaders from the hemisphere met, a third of the countries were run by dictators. In Miami, every official was elected -- though elections in the Dominican Republic were corrupt and problems plague democracy in Peru and Guatemala. In 1967, most of the economies were controlled by government, closed to foreigners and stagnating. Today, governments from Mexico to Argentina are privatizing state-owned enterprises, reducing deficits, controlling inflation and opening borders to imports and investment. The turnabout in policy has turned Latin America into the second-fastest-growing region in the world and the fastest-growing purchaser of U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The summit leaders must now confront two challenges: how to create a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact out of the dozens of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords that already bind nations within the hemisphere; and how to create a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone that is open to democracies outside the hemisphere. Open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the Americas should not become a no-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone for anyone else.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The obvious model is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> accord the U.S. negotiated with Mexico and Canada, and now Chile. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> goes further toward free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> than GATT, which 124 nations signed in April and Congress recently approved. Unlike GATT, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will eliminate tariffs and require signatories to enforce laws protecting workers and the environment. If governments in the hemisphere negotiate an accord like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and then welcome other countries willing to play by the same rules, the Miami summit meeting will prove momentous.</p>\n"}

Both candidates denied any complicity, past or present, and both vowed to scrap the treaty if the Mexican government doesn't agree to changes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama makes a special theme of blaming this and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements for setting off a race to the bottom that destroys American jobs. \"In Youngstown, Ohio,\" he said in a Texas debate, \"I've talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China.\" Why <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would induce a company to move production to China is a puzzle, but you get the idea.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His campaign claims a million jobs have vanished because of the deal. That sounds devastating, but over the last 14 years, the American economy has added a net total of 25 million jobs -- some of them, incidentally, attributable to expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect in  1994, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent. Today it's 4.9 percent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But maybe all the jobs we lost were good ones and all the new ones are minimum-wage positions sweeping out abandoned factories? Actually, no. According to data compiled by Harvard economist Robert Z. Lawrence, the average blue-collar worker's wages and benefits, adjusted for inflation, have risen by 11 percent under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Instead of driving pay scales down, it appears to have pulled them up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Manufacturing employment has declined, but not because we're producing less: Manufacturing output has not only expanded, but has expanded far faster than it did in the decade before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The problem is that as productivity rises, we can make more stuff with fewer people. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it's essentially the definition of economic progress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We're not the only country facing that phenomenon. China makes everything these days, right? But between 1995 and 2002, it lost 15 million manufacturing jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even if the candidates don't want to acknowledge the gains of the last 14 years, it's hard to see how they can blame <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for economic troubles in Ohio or elsewhere. The whole idea was to eliminate import duties in both the United States and Mexico (as well as Canada). What everyone forgets is that we got the best of that bargain, since our tariffs were very low to begin with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexico had very good access to the U.S. market\" already, says Charlene Barshefsky, who was U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative in the Clinton administration. \"What <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did was level the playing field.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics complain that while exports to Mexico have risen, imports from Mexico have risen even faster. But that's not because we embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. It's because our economy has been more robust than theirs. Prosperous consumers buy more goods, from both home and abroad, than struggling consumers. Absent <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalance with Mexico would not be smaller. It would be bigger.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this is a revelation to economists. The candidates' broadsides require them to ignore not just a wealth of evidence but also the overwhelming consensus of experts. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, estimates that 90 percent of the people in his profession regard the accord as a good thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> economist, supports Obama and thinks his positions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are generally better than Clinton's. \"But on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" Bhagwati told me, \"he is dead wrong.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton is also in error, but on the question of which candidate has more consistently and vehemently denounced the accord, Obama has opened up a clear lead. Now there's a race to the bottom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>E-mail: schapman@tribune.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune's editorial board</p>\n"}
{"id": "419004474.xml", "text": "<h2>MIRACLE MAN THE GREATEST FREE TRADER OF ALL</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When he first arrived in Washington, Bill Clinton seemed about as likely to become a champion of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as Elizabeth Hurley is to be caught wearing gingham. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he gave only a lukewarm, carefully hedged endorsement of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. He said he would revoke China's \"most- favored-nation\" trading status. He vowed to get tough on Japan's trading practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we all know politicians can't be trusted, and when it comes to international commerce, Clinton has shown a commendable willingness to renege on his promises. With the House vote to create Permanent Normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Relations with China, he not only won an important battle but capped a record that establishes him as the greatest free- <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r in the White House since Franklin Roosevelt.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton came into office at a time when pressures for protectionism were strong and growing. But the China vote leaves no doubt that the opponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been reduced to the status of those fabled Japanese soldiers holding out on Pacific atolls--vainly continuing a war that has long since been lost. Despite China's poor human-rights record and aggressive policy toward Taiwan, despite the furious efforts of labor unions, Naderites and environmental groups, and despite the upcoming elections, the measure passed by a substantial margin.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He doesn't deserve sole credit. The paradox is that a Democratic president who inspired such intense loathing among congressional Republicans that they impeached him has forged a solid alliance with the GOP on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to overcome resistance from fellow Democrats. Rarely has a chief executive relied so much on the opposition party to pass such a major initiative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton even found himself working closely with Republican Whip Tom DeLay, whose normal urge is to wrap his hands around the presidential windpipe. Last week, 74 percent of House Republicans lined up alongside Clinton to expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China--while 65 percent of Democrats were voting against him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent years, Republicans have favored tearing down commercial barriers, but in the White House, they've talked a better game than they've played. Ronald Reagan, despite his rousing oratory about the virtues of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, didn't do much for the cause. In fact, he provided new import protection for American makers of autos, steel and motorcycles. About his only major contribution was a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>William Niskanen, who chaired Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, noted later that under Reagan, \"For the first time since World War II, the United States added more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> restraints than it removed.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of this was the fault of the Democratic Congress, but the administration's commitment to open borders was not terribly reliable. Reagan Treasury Secretary James Baker boasted of doing more than any previous administration to shield American industries from foreign competition. President Bush did somewhat better, mainly by negotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, though the task of securing congressional approval was left to Clinton. He also maintained normal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre, despite criticism from Democrats in Congress and from the 1992 Democratic presidential nominee, who accused him of \"coddling dictators.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those opposed to protectionism had good reason to vote for Bush over Clinton that year. Early in his term, the new president did little to allay doubts. For months, he let <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> languish, to the point where experts wondered if he really wanted to see it approved. But eventually he threw himself into lobbying for the treaty, and, in the fall of 1993, got it approved by Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In due course, Clinton abandoned his threat to impose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sanctions on China. He decided to push for a trans-Pacific free- <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. He largely resisted efforts to shut out imports from countries affected by the Asian financial crisis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And eventually, his chief negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, hammered out a landmark deal committing China to open up its economy and submit to the anti-protectionist rules of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization. Of course that almost turned into a debacle: Clinton abruptly walked away from the agreement last year, before repenting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His occasional fits of doubt and his efforts to appease protectionists make him the political version of an ace relief pitcher who has to load the bases before striking out the side. But when free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was on the line last week, Clinton once again came through.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustration by Taylor Jones.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1992209293.xml", "text": "<h2>Leaving Nafta Would Cost $50 Billion a Year</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer met in Montreal Monday with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts for a critical day of negotiations over the future of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Mr. Lighthizer told the press that \"some progress was made\" at the talks. That's good. Withdrawing from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be a $50-billion-a-year mistake for the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When it was signed in 1994, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> presented new opportunities for U.S. companies and their workers to sell in new markets. In the decades since it has spurred innovation and investment, and induced firms to strengthen their supply networks. It has also presented new opportunities for American families to purchase a wider variety of products at lower prices. All of this has translated into tangible gains: higher national output, more jobs and higher average real wages.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a new report canvassing dozens of academic and policy studies, I find that the U.S. gross domestic product is now 0.2% to 0.3% larger than it would be without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a yearly boost of about $50 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When U.S.-based multinational companies expand in Mexico and Canada, the result is often more jobs and higher wages back home. These \"foreign\" investments tend to complement, not replace, U.S. operations. A 2014 Peterson Institute study found that a 10% increase in employment at a U.S. multinational's Mexican affiliate leads to a 1.3% increase in employment, a 1.7% increase in exports, and a 4.1% increase in research spending in the stateside parent company.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has helped America's small businesses, too. In 2014, more than 125,000 small businesses exported $136 billion to Canada or Mexico. That is 25% of all U.S. small-business exports. Not only has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> increased the size of American workers' paychecks, it has helped them stretch those paychecks further. American consumers have saved $10.5 billion a year from lower tariffs under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, with most of the benefits going to households with annual incomes below $70,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the delicious case of avocados. For 80 years before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. banned all imports of Mexican avocados. The ban was initially relaxed under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and lifted altogether in 2007. U.S. avocado imports surged 2,214% from 1992 to 2012. Yet the overall U.S. market was growing so rapidly that U.S. avocado production rose, not fell. In California, the number of avocado orchards increased from 4,801 in 2002 to 5,602 in 2012. Many U.S. producers have established a high-end niche, with U.S. varieties commanding a price premium.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and all its gains would be permanently lost. For U.S. companies and their workers, new barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment would limit access to foreign markets, dull additional innovation and investment, and weaken their supply networks. A Business Roundtable study released this month estimates that U.S. GDP would shrink by at least 0.6% -- about $120 billion a year -- in the initial post-exit years, with U.S. exports down more than 2%. This drop in output and exports would initially destroy more than a million U.S. jobs across all 50 states.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Think that \"tougher\" domestic-content rules post-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would help American car manufacturers? Think again. Withdrawing from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> could cost the automobile industry more than 20,000 jobs -- plus nearly 50,000 auto-parts jobs -- while adding $330 to $440 to the cost of every new vehicle sold in America. The idea that more domestic content per vehicle means more domestic jobs ignores that uncompetitive companies make fewer cars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. has been struggling too long with sluggish economic growth. Greater output means more jobs, higher incomes and more opportunity for workers and families. America should not commit a $50-billion-a-year mistake.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Slaughter is dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Matthew J.

{"id": "398451616.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta scorecard</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is common political sport to berate American negotiators for being suckers, accepting agreements in which they give up much more than they get. In attacking the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Ross Perot and his allies are enjoying this sport, charging that naive American officials have accepted a one-sided agreement. They are right on one point. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is indeed one-sided. But not quite the way the critics charge. It requires much more of Mexico than of the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This list is not exhaustive; for example, it leaves out provisions covering financial services, telecommunications, and land transportation. But this scorecard accurately reflects the main point about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>: It is largely a list of things that Mexico must do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. barriers to Mexican <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are already low, with more than half of our imports from Mexico already entering duty-free. If the U.S. is truly unable to meet low-wage Mexican competition -- as the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- opponents fear-then Mexico should already have taken us to the cleaners in our trading relationship. But this has not happened. On the contrary, last year we exported $5.6 billion more to Mexico than it exported to us.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one-sided nature of the commitments does not mean, however, that Mexico has accepted a raw deal. In recent years, Mexico has unilaterally reduced many of its tariffs. This opening to the world economy has helped Mexico to recover from the debt-crisis depression of the early 1980s. It has also benefited U.S. industries, whose exports to Mexico rose by more than 200% between 1986 and 1992. The Mexican reforms of recent years have once again illustrated the mutual gains that can come from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization; <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not a zero-sum game. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will reinforce and extend the Mexican reforms.

{"id": "398607328.xml", "text": "<h2>Free Trade Won't Kill Social Programs</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has been clear since the acrimonious 1993 debate over the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area that our country's politics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy are changing in a fundamental and dangerous way. Joining self-interested parties like U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> unions in their opposition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been apparently well-meaning social groups that erroneously view imports as a threat to their favored social programs, from welfare to environmental protection. The new protectionist social-policy coalition lost the debates over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and then the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>. But it recently scored a huge victory by helping derail President Clinton's request for \"fast track\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiating authority.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the fierce opposition of social-policy advocates to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> doesn't stand up to rational analysis. Many U.S. environmentalists, for example, claimed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would undermine U.S. environmental standards. \"The truth about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" wrote ex-California Gov. Jerry Brown, \"is that it will create a race to the bottom in environmental standards. This is inevitable if we rashly link ourselves to Mexico, where environmental laws are unenforced.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been in effect four years now, and the predicted \"race to the bottom\" in environmental standards has not materialized. The sole environmental effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been that some -- not many -- high-polluting firms have left the U.S. Furniture finishers in central Los Angeles, for instance, moved their plants to Mexico, where they could use more effective but also more toxic furniture sprays.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such relocation shifts the production of pollution inside <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> from a nation where the marginal social cost of pollution is relatively high (as implied by the relatively high U.S. environmental standard) to one where it is lower. Thus even though Mexico loses from more pollution, and the U.S. gains from less pollution, the gain to the U.S. must be greater than the loss to Mexico because of the differences in the two countries' marginal social costs of pollution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An arithmetic example illustrates this point. Assume the marginal, or extra, social cost from an additional unit of pollution is $6 in the U.S., and $3 in Mexico. When the production of one unit of pollution is transferred from the U.S. to Mexico, the U.S. thus gains $6 while Mexico loses $3. This represents a net gain of $3 for the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area as a whole. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> causes a more rational -- i.e. less costly -- distribution of pollution inside the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> area, not an adjustment in environmental standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Experience with the U.S.-Canadian free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement shows free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> also is compatible with different national welfare objectives. The agreement was opposed by Canadian social democrats who feared free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the U.S. would undermine generous Canadian social welfare programs. \"[New Democratic Party] leader Edward Broadbent says his rejection of the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact is motivated less by its actual terms than by his fear that there will inevitably be capitalist pressure on social programs under it,\" reported Toronto's Globe & Mail in 1988. \"Mr. Broadbent told reporters, `I have an immense fear that if the agreement is put in place, corporate pressures would mount to harmonize Canadian social policies, such as subsidized Medicare and pensions, with lower American standards.'\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Broadbent's fears proved groundless, however. The U.S.-Canadian free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement has been in place for almost 10 years and Canadian welfare policy continues to be significantly more generous than America's. One reason: The Canadian dollar fell relative to the U.S. dollar to adjust for the higher social charges Canada imposes on its goods. Canada's depreciated currency made U.S. goods more expensive in the Canadian market and, by doing so, prevented the feared explosion of U.S. imports into Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not only should America's new protectionists look to the Canadian experience for guidance, but to that of the Northern European welfare states as well. In Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, social welfare programs literally exploded during the 1950s and '60s. At the same time, these small European welfare states all followed free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. The $64,000 question: If free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> undermines social welfare programs, as new protectionists fear, why did social democracy flourish in those free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> countries during this 20-year period? The argument that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is damaging to social welfare programs is refuted both by rational analysis and historical experience.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Notwithstanding this fact, the danger posed by the new protectionist coalition to free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> should not be discounted. By identifying <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection with protection of the environment, Naderesque consumer rights, human rights and social welfare benefits, protectionists are gaining an undeserved moral high ground in their battle with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs. Enemies of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> understand the popularity of these social causes and have been clever to attach <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protectionism to them -- not only by forming political coalitions with these social groups but by adopting their language and style. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> unions pursuing their protectionist objectives, for example, pretend they are attempting to stave off a \"race to the bottom\" in labor standards, when in fact they're trying to boost U.S. wages to noncompetitive levels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enemies of the welfare state, on the other hand, do free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> no favor when they also argue that the welfare state is incompatible with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. For if the public must choose between popular social causes on the one hand and a somewhat arcane, poorly understood and much maligned free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy on the other, the outcome may not be a happy one for the followers of Adam Smith.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One lesson from President Clinton's defeat on fast track is clear: Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs must delink <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> protection from social causes, whatever their merits. Otherwise, further protectionist victories loom on the not-too-distant horizon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Krauss, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, is author of \"How Nations Grow Rich\" (Oxford University Press, 1997).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Cuts Holes in Canada's Safety Net\" -- WSJ Dec. 23, 1997)</p>\n"}
{"id": "431496166.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's New Deal</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When things went wrong for global capitalism in the 20th century -- and they often did -- they tended to go wrong first in Mexico. The Victorian version of globalization -- which depended either on colonialism, or on the support of domestic elites so disconnected from the local population that they might as well have been colonists -- began to fall apart in 1911, when Mexicans rebelled against the rule of the ''scientific'' dictator Porfirio Diaz. The cocksure optimism of ''emerging market'' investors in the early 90's got its first serious warning at the end of 1994, when Mexico plunged into financial crisis -- a crisis that proved to be a dress rehearsal for the terrifying Asian crisis that began 30 months later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So Mexico's triumphantly free election on Sunday was cause for rejoicing, not just for Mexico, but for everyone who hopes that this time around we may be getting globalization right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's by no means clear that Vicente Fox Quesada was the better man. In terms of policy positions, he was virtually indistinguishable from Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (what a name!), or PRI. And Mr. Fox will face a sort of reverse version of the Nixon-goes-to-China effect, which may put him at a disadvantage as he tries to continue Mexico's opening to the world. As a former executive of Coca-Cola, he will have to be especially careful not to lay himself open to charges of Coca-colonization, of selling his country to foreign investors. As the candidate of a party originally founded to defend the privileges of the Catholic Church and oppose land reform, he will have to bend over backwards to show that his free-market policies are not just a way to make the rich even richer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet his electoral victory is the best thing that could have happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The worst-case scenario was a narrow victory by the PRI -- a victory that would have raised understandable suspicions of fraud. A solid victory by Mr. Labastida might have been acceptable; but Mr. Fox's victory proves that Mexico's reformers meant what they said, that they really have been out to turn their country into a real democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Need one point out that this is, among other things, a vindication for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement? Sophisticated supporters of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have always acknowledged that the treaty would in itself produce only modest economic gains -- a few percent added to real income in Mexico, a few tenths of a percent added in the U.S. The real justification of the agreement was political: it gave Mexico's reformers an achievement to point to, a promise of better things to come. Some critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> jeered at this argument, claiming that Mexican reform was a sham, that the reformers themselves were merely well-spoken crooks -- a claim made more plausible as revelations emerged about the dealings of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. But now we know that, whatever the sins of Mr. Salinas, the reformers he brought to power were sincere -- and the reform was real.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More broadly, those of us who believe that globalization, while neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for democracy, tends to promote freedom have another success story to add to the list -- a list that now includes Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Argentina and more. When a nation opens to the world, its businesses become less dependent on government favor, its citizens become more aware of how politics is conducted in advanced countries. The result, repeatedly, has been a peaceful transition to true democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, such transitions are not automatic -- we still need heroes. And the hero of Mexico's transition is the current president, Ernesto Zedillo. Mr. Zedillo was an accidental president, a mild-mannered economist thrust into power when assassins gunned down the PRI's chosen candidate. His elevation raised the obvious questions: Would he become just another machine politician? Or would he simply be weak, allowing the ''dinosaurs'' to return to business -- including the business of stealing elections -- as usual?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Mr. Zedillo was neither corrupted by office, nor a patsy for  the corrupt officials in which the  PRI still abounds. He insisted on a fair election. And he and his party have triumphed in defeat: the finest hour in the PRI's history was surely the moment in which it finally lost power.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398825667.xml", "text": "<h2>Liberals vs. Mexicans</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Bush came out last week against quotas in college admissions, liberals were quick to spin it as Republican animus against racial minorities. Yet after one of their own won a lawsuit targeted directly at hard-working Mexicans, the response has been a deafening silence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The liberal crusader, if that's the right word, is none other than Ralph Nader. His Public Citizen lobby sued to block Mexican trucks from entering the U.S., as they are entitled to do under the 10-year-old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> accord. And last week, to almost no media notice, a three-judge panel (one Carter and two Clinton appointees) from the wacky Ninth Circuit ruled that the Administration had acted wrongly in opting for an environmental \"assessment\" rather than a full environmental impact statement before letting in the Mexican trucks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real motive here is better suggested by the co-plaintiffs: the California Truckers Association, the California Labor Federation and the Teamsters. So we have the spectacle of liberal environmentalists siding with protectionist truckers and Big Labor against striving Mexicans. Reactionary liberalism at work.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Mexican truckers were supposed to have access to border states by 1995, leading to full access anywhere in the U.S. by 2000. But when U.S. trucking unions complained, the Clinton Administration caved. The result was a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> arbitration board ruling against the U.S., which in turn led to President Bush's November decision to lift a two-decade-old moratorium limiting Mexican trucks to a 20-mile commercial zone around the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the Ninth Circuit ruling has created a perverse situation. Unlike the trucks that would likely be bought by Mexican companies for long hauls (many of which would in fact be imported from America), the short-haul Mexican trucks that now ply that 20-mile commercial zone are far more of a menace to the environment. To put it another way, Public Citizen has succeeded in keeping the bad trucks on the road while giving the Mexicans no incentive to upgrade to the newer and cleaner trucks.  No wonder some Mexican politicians are calling for retaliation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The hypocrisies here are legion. Back when Mr. Bush was tussling with the Europeans over Kyoto, there was much public handwringing about American \"cowboys\" refusing to live up to their international agreements. Yet here we have the self-styled standard bearer for a purer liberalism scheming to block the U.S. from living up to its international commitments -- and the economic uplift for poor Mexicans that would come with it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush's bet is just the opposite: that America's interests lie in helping the Mexican people better themselves and in so doing bring the prosperity required to make America's southern border, including the environment, more resemble its northern one. In a week in which the Bush Administration found itself excoriated on charges of racial insensitivity, maybe it's time those casting the first stones took a look in the mirror.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409590108.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade Jitters</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FEW SURPRISES emerged from the AFL-CIO forum Tuesday night, at which all nine Democratic presidential candidates appeared onstage to discuss domestic economic and political matters. On most issues, most of the candidates held the views they would be expected to hold: in favor of overtime pay, against tax cuts, eloquent on the subject of job losses. Most touted some form of health care reform, though the format -- 90-second answers to questions -- allowed for little discussion of detail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On one issue, however, even 90 seconds should have provided plenty of time to stake out significant policy differences: free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Certainly some of the candidates have a long record of opposing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich could hardly have been clearer about his opposition. \"My first act in office will be to cancel <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. My second act will be to cancel the WTO,\" he said. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt was not far off this point of view:  \"I am the one who not only voted against but led the fight against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and China free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and Singapore and Chile.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A handful of senators who had actually voted for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, for the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with China, Singapore and Chile were also standing on the podium. They, however, were less than eloquent in defense of their records. When asked, Sen. John F. Kerry quickly asserted that he would vote against a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement covering the Western Hemisphere and promised that as president he would never sign a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement that forces American workers to \"rush to the bottom.\" Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, another longstanding supporter of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, did remind the assembled union members that President Clinton had been a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> supporter also, but then he skipped lightly over his own record to declare himself opposed to \"unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>\" and to complain loudly about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> violations in China. Only Sen. Bob Graham dared to begin his remarks by alluding to the fact that he was going to say something that \"may not be popular with everybody in this room,\"  then pointing out that Americans probably benefit from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and the ability to sell their products abroad, more than anyone else in the world. Yet even he felt obliged to use some diffident language about the need for a \"level playing field\" and better enforcement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What was troubling about these responses was not the particulars of the candidates' remarks. The inclusion of labor and environmental standards within free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts is now standard practice -- quite rightly -- and level playing fields are a legitimate goal of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations. But the apologetic tone that even the defenders of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the Democratic Party felt obliged to adopt was worrisome. It was not accidental that the expansion of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the 1990s coincided with the expansion of the economy in the 1990s. The Clinton administration's effort to make the Democrats into the party of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was a large part of President Clinton's electability. Both the party and the country will suffer if the Democrats become entirely the party of protectionism -- if none of its standard- bearers will forthrightly make the case, as Mr. Clinton did, for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n"}

The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement's lowering of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers has created a new North American marketplace that is generating billions of dollars in new U.S. exports and tens of thousands of new jobs for Americans. It is also helping to create a stronger, more secure neighbor on our southern border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> figures tell the story. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. exports to Mexico surged 16.4% in the first half of 1994, continuing our healthy <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico; our exports to Mexico are growing three times faster than those to the rest of the world. At the same time, Mexican exports to the U.S. have also risen, by 21%, helping to reinvigorate Mexico's economy and spur even more demand for U.S. products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most startling news in these figures is that, in May and June, Mexico even passed mighty Japan as the second-largest consumer of products \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" trailing only Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enthusiasm among U.S. firms for doing business with Mexico is reflected in recent surveys by KPMG Peat Marwick and the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico. Nearly half the U.S. companies surveyed plan, or have already launched, efforts to tap freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. U.S. firms large and small are cranking up production to take advantage of the new continental marketplace, creating more profits and more U.S. jobs. In fact, according to U.S. government data, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has already created eight times as many U.S. jobs as have been dislocated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here are just a few examples of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s many success stories:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- In autos, the Big Three's exports to Mexico are accelerating dramatically -- they shipped 24,000 vehicles in the first seven months of 1994, compared with 4,000 for all of last year. Chrysler is hiring 1,000 U.S. workers to build its first Jeeps for Mexico's market. GM and Ford are also adding jobs for exports to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- In retailing, Wal-Mart, Kmart, J.C. Penney, Price Club and others are opening stores in Mexico to sell household and other goods to eager consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- In agriculture, according to a University of Wisconsin, Madison, study, U.S. dairy exports to Mexico are growing rapidly, and milk producers may see $400 million in annual revenue gains because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. apple shipments to Mexico increased 90% in the first five months of this year, for a total of $58 million in sales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- In computers and telecommunications, Texas Instruments is selling three times as many computer printers and 10 times as many laptops in Mexico since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect on Jan. 1. Motorola has formed a joint venture with a Mexican firm to provide cellular phone service to the northern half of Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- In environmental technology, U.S. firms are showing that a clean environment can be good for business too. U.S. Filter of California recently completed a waste-water treatment plant in Cuernavaca, Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. business confidence has remained strong despite the difficult events in Mexico earlier this year. Mexico has shown great resilience in the face of its challenges. Contrary to the picture <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-bashers painted last year, Mexico has show a strong commitment to democratic, as well as economic, progress. Unprecedented political reforms and nearly $1 billion in modern election systems helped result in the most transparent and fair elections in Mexico's history.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because of this stable climate, and the increased certainty of business rules with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, foreign investment in Mexico has been surging. Before President Carlos Salinas came to office in December 1988, a typical year would bring $2 billion in foreign investment. Last year, that figure was $15.6 billion. In the first quarter of 1994, Mexico received $5.2 billion -- putting it on pace to bring in more than $20 billion in foreign investment for the year. This is providing growth and jobs so Mexicans can find work in Mexico, easing the immigration problem in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's more than just good news -- it's a real success story in the making.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lucey served as President Carter's ambassador to Mexico from 1977 to 1979, and currently lives in Mequon, Wis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related article: \"GATT Is Threatened by the Squeamish . . .\" -- WSJ August 30, 1994)</p>\n"}
{"id": "398920182.xml", "text": "<h2>Americas: Latin America Loses a Friend</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Dec. 10 passing of Robert L. Bartley, The Wall Street Journal's editor emeritus, has been widely recognized as a monumental loss of American intellectual firepower on behalf of free men and free markets. What has been less well recognized is what Latin America has lost, in a friend, a visionary and an intellectual force who viewed the region with undying optimism. It is a record worth revisiting.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year the Americas column celebrated its 20th anniversary. David Asman, the original editor and now an anchor for Fox Cable News, reminded me this week that Bob Bartley launched the column in 1983 because he considered the region to be \"not only under-covered but also poorly covered.\" The problem had become more apparent in the early 1980s as the Soviets inched their way into the Caribbean Basin. Most of the few correspondents in the region seemed content with mainly reporting Castroite propaganda. What made its way to American readers was often sketchy at best, and, at worst, admiring of the \"revolution\" that was bringing Nicaragua under Soviet influence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>George Melloan, the Journal's Deputy Editor, International who worked with Bartley for 32 years, made a tour of the region in 1980. \"You had to be blind not to see what the Sandinistas were doing,\" he told me the other day. Nicaraguan newspaper editor Pedro Chamorro told him the Soviet ambassador had walked into his office not long after the Sandinistas took over and announced, \"We're in charge here, now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bob's concern with Latin America during the Cold War was based partly on U.S. security interests. But perhaps as importantly, it reflected his view that all human beings had a right to liberty. As he wrote in 1993, \"the fundamentals of human nature are universal.\" He exposed the hypocrisy of the international left, and its U.S. adherents, who seemed to view millions of Latinos as unworthy of freedom.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bartley's greatest contribution to the region, though, may have been his interest in Mexico. He had followed the country closely since 1980 and never seemed to tire of examining its rich culture, mysterious traditions and bitter politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He recognized its importance to the U.S. \"During the Cold War,\" recalls Mr. Asman, \"Bob said that Mexico was the second most important country for the U.S. If it weren't for the Soviet Union, it would have been the most important. He recognized that the cultural influence of Mexico on the U.S. was underrated and vice-versa. And he saw the tremendous influence that Mexicans living in the U.S. would have on Mexico's politics.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paul Greenberg, the Pulitzer Prize winning editorial page editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette pointed out in the Los Angeles Times on Dec. 23, that despite how he was tagged in the mainstream, Bartley wasn't really a \"conservative.\" Said Mr. Greenberg, \"He was more a liberal counter-revolutionary.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bartley's differences with conventional conservatism were especially apparent in issues involving Mexico. In a 1993 column on the drug war and the murder of a Mexican bishop in Guadalajara, he took note of a contention making its way around Washington, that \"because of violence the U.S. should hold back on closer relations and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He disagreed. Mexicans saw themselves \"as deserving partners, spending blood and money to hold the front line in a drug war waged primarily for the benefit of the gringos.\" His conclusion was that \"no notion could be more mindless than that the way to fight drugs is to keep Mexico at arm's length. If the war can be won, it will have to be not by less cooperation and integration but by more.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His ideas on immigration were consistent with this theme. Bartley viewed Mexican workers, hungry for opportunity and ready to work, as an asset to the American economy. When the Clinton administration, with strong support from Republican nativists, went to work on a Berlinesque wall on the Califorina border, Bartley worried that the migrants would shift their routes into the desert and the number of deaths from exposure would grow. Indeed, that is precisely what happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Bartley had no illusions about the faults of Mexico's 70-year-old one-party system. But he also recognized that an evolution was underway. He saw the 1968 massacre of protesting students at Tlatelolco as Mexico's Tiananmen Square. He fully expected the economic liberalization of the Salinas government to stir a political transformation, and it did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An integrated North America was coming, whether cultural protectionists wanted it or not. Bartley put his efforts into establishing the right fundamentals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among his most important contributions was his advocacy of a stable peso-dollar exchange rate to protect Mexican wages and savings. In a 1996 column he took issue with the conventional wisdom that to \"stay competitive\" Mexico had to depreciate its currency, a policy he correctly thought would sentence Mexicans to perpetual poverty. \"The right inflation rate is the one you end up with after you've set monetary policy to stabilize the exchange rate,\" wrote Bartley.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course that debate wouldn't have been possible if Mexicans had not first won a long, hard battle for central bank independence. Pedro Aspe, Mexico's former finance minister, says Bartley was an important voice in that effort, as well as in the struggle for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> approval. \"On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> he was in favor of it all along and kept reminding us that if we open as much as possible, and as fast as possible, with no exceptions and special rules, we would not need to create a bureaucracy like the one in Brussels. And indeed we did not create a permanent bureaucracy with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"His contributions to our free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement and to our independent central bank were crucial and indeed today they are the central pillars of stability. Can you think of a better friend for Mexico and with better forward thinking about Mexico-U.S. relations?\" Mr. Aspe asks. I can't, or a better friend of Latin America as a whole.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398898132.xml", "text": "<h2>The Triumph of Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox sit down together today at the Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico, they might begin with a toast to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. The treaty turns 10 this month and, despite protectionist bellyaching, a decade of closer commercial ties across our shared 2,000-mile border has been a boon to both nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> includes Canada, of course. But the treaty was historic in 1994 because no advanced country since Britain in the 1800s had dared to institutionalize open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with such an underdeveloped neighbor. The U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Canada. Bringing Mexico into the mix was the revolutionary gamble.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> visionaries in the U.S. went out on that limb for good reason. Mexico's authoritarian political system, repressed economy and resulting poverty were creating problems that could not be contained at the border in perpetuity. Mexican instability would eventually spill over the Rio Grande. The choice was easy: Either help Mexico develop as part of an integrated North America, or watch the economic gap widen and the risks for the U.S. balloon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By this measure alone <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a success. In less than a decade the openness of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> helped promote monumental changes in Mexican politics, and in its economy and financial system. Greater transparency in almost all facets of governance means that Mexico is far more stable today than it was 10 years ago. It has also made for exponentially better U.S.-Mexico relations, and for a more promising North American future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican liberalization had begun before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, under the presidency of Carlos Salinas. But by making markets open to American and Canadian goods by law, in the year Mr. Salinas left office, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ensured that the trend toward liberalization would continue under a new administration. Without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico's destructive 1994 devaluation might well have pulled the country back into another decade of isolationist nationalism, of the sort we have seen in Argentina. As it turned out, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> helped the Mexican economy stabilize more quickly amid the post-devaluation chaos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The economic shock of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> competition has in turn helped open Mexican politics. In July 2000, what Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa had famously called the \"perfect dictatorship\" finally came to an end. Mexicans elected their first president from outside the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 70 years. Mexican elections at the national and state level are now considered free, fair and highly competitive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political accountability provoked yet another advance. When Mr. Fox took office in December 2000, there was no mega-devaluation of the peso as there had been in the presidential years 1976, 1982, 1988 and 1994. The drivers of this historic non-event were unmistakably related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That is, pressure to attract foreign investment had forced Mexico to open its books, and at Mr. Fox's inauguration there were no monetary or fiscal surprises.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexican businesses -- notably the Monterrey elite -- had new incentives as well. They became importers of components and machinery for production as well as exporters. Their transactions were now in dollars. Open markets changed the dynamics of a currency play that once had Mexican producers lobbying the government for a weaker peso.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> efficiencies have also boosted North American economic growth. According to Dan Griswold at the Cato Institute's Center for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Policy Studies, \"since 1993, the value of two-way U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico has almost tripled from $81 billion to $232 billion, growing as fast as U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the rest of the world.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> isn't to create jobs per se but to allow resources to find their most efficient use and redeploy workers to better-paying jobs. Manufacturing networks incorporating the comparative advantages of all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> members have made North America an attractive investment for global capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The small outflow of direct manufacturing investment to Mexico has been overwhelmed by the net inflow of such investment from the rest of the world,\" writes Mr. Griswold. From 1994 to 2001, U.S. manufacturing companies invested an average of $2.2 billion a year in Mexican factories, in addition to the $200 billion invested annually in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S.-Mexico relationship still faces challenges -- from water rights to crime and immigration. But the future is infinitely more promising now that we share a greater number of economic interests and political values. On those counts alone, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a spectacular success.</p>\n"}

These two countries will co-chair talks next year to establish a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement of the Americas by 2005.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement with Chile, which seems certain to be approved by Congress, would eliminate tariffs on 85% of goods immediately and on all goods within 12 years. President Clinton promised the deal seven years ago, but it had to wait for the so-called fast-track negotiating authority that Congress finally granted Bush.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The measure would allow U.S. financial, communications and insurance companies into Chile and establish a secure and predictable legal framework for U.S. investors. Neither country can weaken environmental protections to encourage investment. Both countries have pledged to observe internationally recognized labor standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> illustrates the net gain likely to occur. Yes, some companies did shift manufacturing jobs to cheaper Mexican labor. As former President Bush said at the anniversary celebration, since it went into effect in 1994, \"350,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the U.S. ... but 2 million better-paying jobs were created.\" There was no \"giant sucking sound.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider this. To sell one of its U.S.-made tractors in Chile today, Caterpillar Inc. would have to pay $13,090 in tariffs. Once the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement is signed, that same tractor enters Chile tariff-free.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The big story is still being written. To unite the economies of 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere into a single free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone presents much bigger challenges. Some nations are industrialized and others poor and mainly agricultural. Education levels vary wildly. Engaging Brazil, with the largest economy in the Southern Hemisphere, will be essential to pulling in the rest and determining how poorer nations can be helped to join.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After his meeting with Bush, Lula, as the Brazilian president is widely known, told reporters he favors aggressive free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies -- a turnabout from his fiery protectionist past. He urged the United States to end subsidies and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers that keep Latin American farm products, such as Brazilian orange juice, from U.S. buyers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> running smoothly and a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Chile at hand, the U.S. can focus on Brazil as the next steppingstone to a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal.</p>\n"}

His scripts typically include plenty of threats, complaints and drama, designed not just to get his way but to keep the public engaged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not being drama critics, we'll let others judge the entertainment merits of his strategy. But when it comes to tangible results, his renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has worked better than his detractors expected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, came to fruition in cliffhanger talks with Canada that ended Sunday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It retains most of the valuable parts of the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal, which was designed to facilitate more commerce and greater economic integration among the United States, Canada and Mexico. Under it, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the three has grown from about $290 million to $1.2 trillion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But as you would expect of an economic compact drafted before the internet, email and mobile phone use became part of every facet of life, it was due for a renovation to accommodate changes in these North American economies. The ones agreed on by the three governments in recent months reflect that need.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the Midwest, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been a boon. Automakers have gained from being able to make and assemble different components wherever efficiency dictates. With some tweaks -- which, regrettably, will make it more expensive to build vehicles in Mexico -- the new accord largely preserves that system.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's no accident that the two biggest customers for Illinois exports are Canada and Mexico, and sales have grown at a solid pace in recent years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That corn you see being harvested when you drive through the countryside? In a normal year, about 40 percent of it is shipped to our North American neighbors. A tariff war with either or both of them, which might have erupted had the talks failed, would have taken a heavy toll on heartland farmers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are other useful steps, notably stronger protections for intellectual property, which is a particular U.S. strength. Canada and Mexico obtained commitments that they won't be subject to the 25 percent auto duties Trump has threatened to impose on other countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He won a big concession by persuading Ottawa to take steps to open up its highly protected dairy industry -- which has long blocked U.S. competition with import quotas and tariffs as high as 300 percent. We take it as good news that Dairy Farmers of Canada immediately denounced the change. Wisconsin and other Midwest dairy farmers, who lost sales after Canada tightened its rules last year, are likely to take a more positive view.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump correctly dropped his demand to get rid of the independent tribunals set up in the original treaty to resolve disputes about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy. Some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hawks see them as an infringement on American sovereignty, but they serve to ensure a fair process to everyone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Keeping them was perhaps the highest priority for Canadians -- who otherwise would have to litigate in American courts, where U.S. companies would enjoy a home-field advantage. The panels function to promote free commerce under established rules, something that benefits all three nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> created a mostly open continental market that fosters trilateral growth, cooperation and progress -- and, not least important, Midwestern prosperity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In concluding the new pact, the administration deserves credit for preserving that fundamental achievement.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398466827.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta opens more than a trade door</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, from a long-term perspective, is President Clinton's most critical foreign policy decision of his first year and probably his first term. Its enactment -- or defeat -- will have a profound impact on our economy, on our relations with Mexico, and on prospects for political and social stability throughout the hemisphere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> so far, however, has reflected more about our anxieties than about our opportunities. Unfortunately, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has become a lightning rod for these anxieties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be a tragic irony if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> were to be defeated in the name of saving American jobs, or improving the environment, or stemming illegal immigration. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause our current problems. How could it? It is not yet in place. And defeating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will not solve them. Indeed the truth is quite the opposite. On every point, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is part of the solution.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the economy, the inescapable truth is that Mexico currently has <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers that are higher than America's. Although it has made significant strides in opening its economy in the past few years, it retains high tariffs on nearly all imports of manufactured goods and it all but prohibits U.S. service providers from operating in Mexico. And yet, there are virtually no barriers to locating economic production in Mexico. Anyone who wants to relocate a factory to Mexico is free to do so now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is now, before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. What <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> does is eliminate virtually all Mexican protection of its industrial and agricultural sectors and open for the first time the Mexican market to U.S. service providers in such important fields as banking, insurance, construction and telecommunications. The U.S. eliminates a 4% tariff on Mexican goods that is less than one-half as large as the 10% Mexican tariff on U.S. goods. In other words, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> makes it easier to produce goods and services in the U.S. and sell to Mexico. As a result, after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> there will be less incentive to move production to Mexico, not more.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is why most economic analyses project a significant increase in exports to Mexico and a net increase in jobs in the U.S. But we don't need to rely on theory to predict the effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; the best evidence is the record to date. Since the partial opening of Mexico's economy began in the mid-1980s, American exports to Mexico have exploded, from $12.6 billion in 1986 to $40.6 billion in 1992. Mexicans today purchase more American imports per person than do the Europeans or the Japanese, supporting several hundred thousand American jobs. Even in the short-term, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will lock these gains in and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs by further opening the Mexican economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, the world is undergoing a massive economic transformation, and such change is always accompanied by worker dislocation. But the job losses related to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are tiny relative to the effects of defense downsizing, competition from Europe, Japan, China and Southeast Asia, and the normal churning of the economy. According to a recent Congressional Budget Office study, the number of workers who may lose their jobs because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be no more than 1% of all workers who lose their jobs every year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't mean we don't need a strong worker adjustment package. We do. Or national health insurance. We do. Or pension security. We do. But the point is that worker retraining, guaranteed health coverage, and pension security aren't the prices we pay for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. We need them with or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in order to treat change as an opportunity and not a threat.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But most important, we must keep our eye on the long term -- the changing nature of global competition. Economic competition in the year 2020 won't consist of scattered countries nibbling at each other, but major regions operating as economic units on the global playing field. The biggest threat to American jobs does not come from Mexico but from Europe, Japan and China. With <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, we will be better able to save American jobs from those threats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unless we in North America work as partners in this game, we are going to be at a severe disadvantage in competition with these large economic centers. Europe is rapidly moving toward a single, integrated economy, while Japan has been building economic bridges throughout Southeast Asia as part of its strategy to be competitive with America and Europe in the 21st century. These strategies have not lowered wages or living standards in Japan or Germany. Quite the contrary. Strong regional links have made these countries more internationally competitive and their workers more prosperous.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But if we don't allow <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to help us build an economic unit that would provide advantages in technology, labor diversity, market size, and capital, we will limp behind in the race for economic growth. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will enable us to combine American, Mexican and Canadian economic strengths, building a region of 360 million people that is stronger together than it could be apart.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With regard to the political and social advantages of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it is in our national interest that we have a stable, prosperous and pro-American neighbor to our south. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> presents a historic opportunity to ensure that relationship. Notwithstanding the knee-jerk anti-American sentiment that marked Mexican politics for generations, most Mexicans are pro-American. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is a symbol of the triumph of a new optimism over traditional negativism. The level of its support in the Mexican population and the benefits it will bring reflect a sea change in official Mexican attitudes toward the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For generations, Mexico's political economy was a disaster. But in the mid1980s, it took a 180 degree turn. It dramatically reduced its budget deficit by an amount that was the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans in just four years. It opened its economy to international competition and sought to return to the world capital markets after the destruction of the debt crisis. It began to make political changes toward a functioning democracy and cracked down on official corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico wants to see itself in the 21st century as a society that has taken its place among modern democratic nations. It has not fully arrived, but <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will speed Mexican progress toward a future that is irrevocably tied to the U.S., which means more democracy, a cleaner environment, and higher living standards for all the people of North America. But if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not enacted, it is conceivable that the Mexican economy will falter dramatically, creating a return to the old politics where demagogues fight bitterly for power while democracy is shunted aside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Should we care about the Mexican economy any more than, say, the Thai economy? Absolutely. With half the population of Mexico under the age of 19, a desperate Mexican economy will produce millions of illegal immigrants flooding into America. It is better to have Mexicans working legally in a growing Mexico than taking jobs from our poorest citizens and burdening our social service system in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What about the environment? A Mexico dedicated to its own citizenry's health and engaged on many fronts with the U.S. will be a Mexico that has a cleaner environment. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will allow it to do something about it because richer nations can afford to be cleaner nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps most fundamentally, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will show the world that we understand the post-Cold War situation to be about building bridges and including others in a common destiny. This inclusiveness has always been an American strength. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> demonstrates it anew. It is here that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opponents are the most cynical, opposing the treaty with thinly veiled attempts to play on resentments rooted in ethnic chauvinism and to promote fears of closer relations with Mexicans. An Ideal Opportunity One of America's greatest strengths is our remarkable ethnic, racial and religious diversity. We must maximize that advantage, just as surely as we would utilize a strength in production, education, or geography. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> gives us an ideal opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the global competition of the 21st century, the ability to forge international alliances and to relate to people different from ourselves will be critical assets. More important, enacting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will enrich American, Mexican and Canadian societies. It will allow us to demonstrate once again that our societies are open enough and understanding enough to be able to grow culturally as well as economically and politically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Defeating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> won't create jobs, control immigration, or clean the environment. Either we address the problems of economic transformation head on, or we bury our heads in the sand, blame <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for situations it did not create, and accept a lower standard of living and a fraying social fabric.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> opens more than a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> door. It will enhance our nation in ways that are absolutely critical to growth, progress and security in the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bradley is a Democratic senator from New Jersey.</p>\n"}

Think regional; To prosper, we should include Mexico and Canada in our economic policies.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Washington focuses on the urgent and has little time for the important. As a result, it faces chronic problems and cannot plan for the future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is no better illustration of this than the idea that was missing from President Obama's address last week to Congress on jobs: North America. Had he grasped it, he would have amplified some of his proposals in a way that would have helped achieve his job goals and two others -- doubling exports and limiting undocumented immigration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Americans view our neighbors, north and south, as very dependent on the United States. That is true, and it explains why we don't take them seriously, except as problems. What few Americans realize is how dependent we are on them. The top two markets for U.S. exports are not China and Germany; they are Canada and Mexico. Our top two sources of energy imports are not Saudi Arabia and Venezuela; they are Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The light bulb on our interdependence should have switched on when the electricity in the Southwest and Mexico switched off last week, purportedly because of a single operator in Yuma, Ariz. Our economies are interconnected. That means when one country has a crisis, all are hurt, but a success in one helps the others. More important, if we find new ways to relate to each other, we can lift all three countries and make the region competitive with China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For seven years after the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. tripled <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and had the largest expansion of jobs in our history. But since 2001, North America has languished because of new security barriers, Chinese competition, the lack of infrastructure investment and no continental strategy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The potential is clear. As our two neighbors' economies grew faster than ours coming out of the recession, U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in 2010 increased by nearly $80 billion, from $334 billion to $412 billion. The total was more than four times our exports to China and eight times our combined exports to Korea, Colombia and Panama. The president has rightly recommended approval of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with those three countries, but that is a side issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We can expand our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> fastest by focusing on our neighbors, and it benefits us more. This is because unlike U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the rest of the world, the three North American countries make products together, meaning that a much higher percentage of our imports are composed of exports from our two neighbors. We should eliminate restrictive \"rules of origin,\" which add a tax as high as the tariff that was eliminated by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, and combine, rather than duplicate, customs' forms, personnel and frequent-traveler programs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> relied on the magic of the marketplace to reduce the income gap, the major cause of migration from Mexico, but that failed. Foreign investment concentrated on the border, where it served as a magnet attracting migrants from the south and eventually to the U.S. If Mexico were to sustain growth at twice the level of the United States for a decade, the income gap between the two countries would shrink by 22%, and its success would benefit both it and the U.S. That's not enough to stop illegal immigration, but recent data on reduced immigration suggest Mexico's growth would alter the calculus of migrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nearly 80% of North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> goes by truck, and while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has grown, no new roads have been built. Obama ought to expand his infrastructure fund to be a North American one, with contributions from all three countries. The leaders of each nation should then instruct their transportation ministers to develop a North American plan for transportation and infrastructure that would include another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> corridor from the busiest transit point in Windsor, Ontario, to southern Mexico. Such a highway would bring down costs, expand <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, encourage foreign investment in all of Mexico and reduce illegal migration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2009, the three leaders of North America pledged to meet the next year, but that still hasn't happened. Obama should invite his counterparts to address the full North American agenda, beginning with a strategy to lift the continent's economy and then addressing transportation, immigration, education and borders.

Remember the Great Grape Crisis, when a few tainted Chilean grapes led to a gringo hysteria that almost wiped out a Chilean industry?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Failing to proceed with Chiles membership in a timely fashion would not only be unfortunate for the country that has long been the most qualified for partnership in a free trading relationship with the U.S., but would damage prospects for the gradual development of a hemispheric free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> community.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. risks losing at least as much as the South American nations. Countries in South America already are forming overlapping regional alliances within which <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has grown at a staggering rate. Brazil, the giant of the region and with a tradition of independent behavior, has long harbored dreams of organizing the South American economy around itself. So the U.S. could find that by the time it is ready to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> terms with the fast-changing countries of South America, the governments there will have little desire, or need, to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile was, by far, the country in all of Latin America most ready for incorporation into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> at the time Mexico's membership was negotiated. But Chile's distance from the U.S., modest $44 billion economy and population of just 13 million kept it behind the much more populous and problematic country on our border. There were compelling arguments for putting Mexico first, most of them not directly economic. They included Mexico's size, its location, concerns about political instability there, and the immigration issue. Whether or not the new rescue package heads off deep economic dislocation in Mexico and elsewhere, there is still reason to show that economic and political maturity do pay off -- by proceeding with Chile's membership on schedule this year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Membership in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will be of more symbolic than real importance to Chile. One study done in Santiago predicted that a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement would produce only small increases in overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the U.S. and Chile, which now exceeds $4 billion and is already strongly positive on the U.S. side. The most obvious benefit to U.S. exporters would be the savings of an estimated $200 million a year in Chilean tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chile's membership in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact would amount to an anointment of the almost revolutionary way Chile has turned its economy around in the past decade. Most important, Chile has shown that it is possible to graduate from an \"underdeveloped\" economy to a \"developed\" one in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>True, Chile is a country with historical and cultural characteristics that set it apart from most other Latin American nations -- a middle-class mind-set (even if not everyone, in fact, is able to live that way) and accompanying respect for education; the relative homogeneity of the population; a level of population growth only slightly higher than ours; a tradition of very little official corruption, and dedicated and capable bureaucrats. But rewarding Chile's accomplishments would throw a spotlight on the discipline and difficult choices that have been required to put Chile where it is today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has been common in recent weeks to compare Mexico's current crisis with that which swept Chile at the beginning of the 1980s, when Chile was hit by a 90% devaluation of the currency over 12 months, a cutoff of foreign loans, the collapse of international copper prices and the failure of the domestic banking system. What's particularly important to keep in mind is that Chile's government at the time, led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, was seen as one of the pariah regimes of the world, and therefore could not expect international help to extricate itself from a recession more intense in relative terms than the Great Depression was in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these strikes against it, within a few years Chile laid the foundation for the healthy, aggressive trading nation we know today. Some of Chile's best minds pioneered many unique market-oriented mechanisms to restructure the economy, such as the debt-equity swaps that allowed the country to get on top of its massive foreign debt and that have been copied in many other countries. Sweeping deregulations and tax cuts and simplifications eased market entry for thousands of small and mid-size firms, which broadened Chile's economic base. And a low, uniform tariff ensured that no industry would be singled out as \"strategic,\" and therefore deserving of special protections from international competition. These efforts lowered the cost of production and sharpened Chile's competitive edge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the political side, the crisis had the effect of emboldening and energizing the political opposition to Gen. Pinochet, which was able to overturn his rule at the ballot box. That same opposition had the good sense to warmly embrace the good things accomplished under Gen. Pinochet's rule while abandoning his political authoritarianism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time freely elected leaders took office in early 1990, the hard-won economic recovery had become a source of pride for almost all Chileans. Indeed, the change from military to civilian rule was one of the smoothest in history. And the economy suffered fewer jolts than a change between Democrats and Republicans produces in the U.S. If ever a country has deserved recognition for turning a disastrous situation around without any bailouts, it's Chile. From time to time, it wouldn't be so bad to reward those who take full responsibility and do the right thing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Christian, formerly a newspaper and wire correspondent in Latin America, owns a book publishing house in the Kansas City area and is editing a business guide to Latin America.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398803001.xml", "text": "<h2>Thinking Things Over: Open Nafta Borders? Why Not?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reformist Mexican President Vincente Fox raises eyebrows with his suggestion that over a decade or two <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> should evolve into something like the European Union, with open borders for not only goods and investment but also people. He can rest assured that there is one voice north of the Rio Grande that supports his vision. To wit, this newspaper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We annually celebrate the Fourth of July with a paean to immigration, the force that tamed this vast continent and built this great Republic. This is not simply history; immigration continues to refresh and nourish America; we would be better off with more of it. Indeed, during the immigration debate of 1984 we suggested an ultimate goal to guide passing policies -- a constitutional amendment: \"There shall be open borders.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The naysayers who want to limit or abolish immigration look backward to a history they do not even understand. Each new immigrant group has been derided as backward, unclean, crime-ridden and so on; each has gone on to adopt the American dream of a free and independent people, and to win advancement economically, politically, socially. The ability to assimilate is the heart of the American genius, precisely the trait that sets the United States off from other nations. Immigration makes the U.S. what it is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On this Fourth of July we celebrate this history more forthrightly than we have in two decades. Anti-immigrant hysteria peaked in 1996, when the California Republican Party self-destructed with anti-immigrant themes. Today the GOP is led by George W. Bush, who told campaign audiences \"family values do not stop at the Rio Grande.\" The employer sanctions in the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli bill are now recognized as windmill tilting. Congress has repeatedly raised the limits on H-1B visas for engineers and such, to 195,000 a year from an original 65,000. Last week the U.S. Supreme Court twice held that aliens are people too, entitled to such basic rights as the presumption of innocence, petty 1996 legislation notwithstanding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the same time, the U.S. is gradually relearning the secret of assimilation -- every informal recognition of cultural differences but no formal ones. \"Bilingual education,\" which trapped schoolchildren in a Hispanic ghetto for the benefit of ethnic politicians and a few teachers, is on its way out. Racial quotas generally are under increasing suspicion. In the next census, in 2010, increasingly meaningless and irritating questions about ethnicity may be abolished. This too bodes well for future acceptance of immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration now runs about a million a year against a population of 275 million, a rate that remains below the historical average. The proportion of immigrants with postgraduate education is three times the native rate. New immigrants are no longer eligible for welfare, removing that bugaboo. A study by the National Research Council in 1997 found that while unschooled immigrants are net recipients of taxpayer money in the first generation, their children repay these costs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>About half of current immigrants are Hispanic, though the Asian component is projected to grow rapidly. By far the largest single source is President Fox's Mexico, a Third World nation of nearly 100 million inhabitants sharing a 2,000-mile border with the U.S. The opportunity north of the border is inevitably a huge magnet for the poor but ambitious. There is no realistic way to stop the resulting flow of people -- certainly no way that would be acceptable to the American conscience.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was headlined last May when five sunburned and dehydrated survivors staggered up to Border Patrol agents in a desert called \"The Devil's Path\" about 25 miles north of the Arizona-Sonora border. Searchers found six more survivors, then 14 bodies. Smugglers had abandoned the group in 115-degree heat without water. This is no isolated instance; last year 491 souls perished trying to immigrate. With the U.S. Border Patrol doubled by the 1996 act, these victims were forced to risk death in increasingly desperate corridors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sealing the border against people willing to risk death is not a practical option, let alone a morally attractive one. The only hope is to manage the flow of people in a constructive and humane way. As President Fox says, \"By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Item one in any agenda to ease border problems would be rapid economic development to provide opportunity within Mexico. It's entirely possible that Mexico will become the next tiger economy. It has the huge advantage of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the world's largest market. For all its poverty, it has a large first-world economic sector and a technocratic elite educated at the best American universities. Contrary to stereotypes, the general population is exceptionally hard-working. Politically President Fox promises a fresh start after ending 71 years of one-party rule. If Mexico can avoid the currency depredations that have marred its last quarter-century, the immigration problem may start to fade.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North of the border, the solution to the problem of illegal immigration is to make it legal, or at least to normalize the movement of people. A program of temporary work visas would allow Mexicans to go home; the incentive for undocumented aliens now is to stay rather than face the border barrier a second time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Laws and regulations can generally be made more generous. The 1996 Border Patrol expansion is a dubious expense, expanding a cops-and-robbers game that sometimes turns deadly. After the 14 deaths in May, the Mexicans promised to patrol their side of the border in especially dangerous areas, while the Border Patrol promised to arm agents with pepper balls rather than bullets. During the campaign, President Bush talked of dividing the Immigration and Naturalization Service into two agencies, one to police the border and another to aid immigrants already here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another amnesty for undocumented aliens is already in the air; every decade or so Congress somehow or another faces this reality. Even opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> borders completely, I would dare to suggest, might not unleash a new flood of immigrants. There is a limit to the number who actually want to come, and experience suggests that many of those who do already can find a way. And after all, we did have a long history of unlimited quotas for Western Hemisphere immigrants, ending only in 1965.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Fox is nothing if not a visionary. Many scoffed at his ambition to unseat the machine that had run Mexico for generations; now they scoff at his proposals on immigration. But over the decade or two he mentioned, a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with open borders may yet prove not so wild a dream.</p>\n"}
{"id": "421230319.xml", "text": "<h2>Traffic With Big Benefits; It's time to end delay on implementing NAFTA truck rules at border</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton administration has no reason to delay any longer in implementing the trans-border trucking provisions of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. The president should listen to the four governors whose states border Mexico. They have seen the economic benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and know these benefits will expand once truckers from both nations are free to move products to market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A year ago, then-Transportation Secretary Federico Pena arbitrarily announced that this aspect of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> treaty would be shelved until safety and security requirements for Mexican trucks working north of the border were improved. It should be noted that Pena's decision came in the heat of an election year when the Teamsters Union was loudly protesting the imminent opening of the border and the possibility that American truckers' jobs might be jeopardized.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, a year after the Teamsters staged protests on the Texas border, the governors of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have stated their satisfaction with the vehicle safety and security measures being implemented by federal and border-state agencies. They are anxious to proceed with the program and reap the economic payoffs it promises on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Opening Mexico to U.S. truckers, and of course vice versa, promises to boost the revenues of the U.S. trucking industry and, ultimately, even that of the protesting Teamsters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gov. Pete Wilson has ordered a $25-million investment to build and staff two facilities to monitor Mexican trucks and to ensure that California is fully prepared for safety inspections of commercial vehicles. Any Mexican vehicle deemed unsafe would not be permitted to cross.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In tandem with California, the Clinton administration should put aside any political hesitation and authorize and fund road and other infrastructure improvements required to handle increased commercial truck traffic across the border.

Witness the latest idea from a trio of senators to transform the regulatory landscape.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a March 20 letter to President Trump, Ted Cruz of Texas, Steve Daines of Montana and Cory Gardner of Colorado urged him to use the renegotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement to reform domestic regulation and enhance U.S. competitiveness. Specifically, they suggested he include a \"competitiveness\" chapter in the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, streamlining permitting for projects, bolstering infrastructure and codifying key regulatory reforms. \"Rather than pursuing a defensive strategy that focuses solely on what other countries are doing to us, we need to develop a more comprehensive, offensive U.S. strategy to strengthen our economy from within,\" wrote the senators.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These ideas aren't new. Congressional Republicans have been pushing them for years, and Mr. Trump campaigned on them. The novelty is the legislative vehicle: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Any final <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement will be ratified under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Authority, which requires only 50 votes in the Senate, and therefore escapes a Democratic filibuster. A competitiveness chapter can be included as an annex that applies only to the U.S., so that neither Mexico nor Canada would need to agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vehicle would allow Republicans to multiply the Trump administration's deregulatory wins, further bolstering the economy. Take project permitting. Washington can take years to conduct environmental assessments, turning off investors and running up costs. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan already has a proposal to overhaul the decades-old system that is ready-made for a new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> competitiveness chapter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Equally important, such a chapter would allow Republicans to guard against regulatory incursions by future Democratic presidents. Mr. Trump has been aggressive in rolling back the Obama regulatory agenda, but a President Elizabeth Warren could pile the crushing rules back on. The Cruz-Daines-Gardner letter proposes including in any <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> chapter the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or Reins Act, a proposal that would require congressional approval of any regulation costing $100 million or more. The House passed that bill a year ago, but Senate Democrats stymied it with the threat of a filibuster.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some conservatives feel uneasy about the idea of muddying up traditional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks. But it's hard to envision this roiling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations as it would impose no obligations on the other parties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Supporters argue that all <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> discussions would benefit from an emphasis on structural issues that affect domestic competitiveness. Americans gripe about bad deals and unfair practices, while ignoring the barriers imposed by Washington. Instead of seeking to protect U.S. companies with tariffs or subsidies, why not put an emphasis on true competitive advantage? Such provisions might even make <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements more attractive to wavering Republicans -- free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs and protectionists alike.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there's the worry that this would set a precedent, allowing that future President Warren to codify, say, union card check. But the better question is why she'd need precedent as her excuse. The idea is already out there. Democrats have long used <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks to try to force costly labor rules, and they've never been deterred by Republican restraint before. President Obama (whose use of recess appointments the Supreme Court found unconstitutional) and Harry Reid (who killed the filibuster for nominations) proved the left isn't constrained by procedural norms that get in the way of its agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That realization has inspired Republicans to think more creatively about procedure -- from bolder use of the Congressional Review Act, to the revival of congressional spending-rescission powers, to this <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> plan. They recognize that they may have a brief window of power, a chance to do real good. They also see an icy Democratic resistance, which -- also expecting the GOP's time in power to be short -- steadfastly refuses to compromise. Thwarting that blockade, taking this opportunity, requires a fresh approach to how things have traditionally been done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's a growing consensus among conservatives, to judge by the many groups that are racing to support the Cruz-Daines-Gardner strategy -- Americans for Tax Reform, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Club for Growth, the Independent Women's Forum. In a recent letter to Mr. Trump, 30 such organizations endorsed the idea of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> competitiveness chapter, arguing that it would \"strengthen the core objectives of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiations\" by \"making it more attractive for companies to invest and create jobs in the United States,\" even as it made \"another Obama-like regulatory assault on the U.S. economy nearly impossible.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be another accomplishment Republicans could use to motivate their base in the midterms -- and another Trump promise fulfilled.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to kim@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Kimberley A.

{"id": "2318509127.xml", "text": "<h2>Speaker Pelosi, Midwest exporters have lost patience. Replace NAFTA with USMCA.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Donald Trump signed a new agreement to replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a lot of people who depend on borderless commerce -- many of them Midwest exporters of manufactured and agricultural goods -- breathed a sigh of relief. After 15 months of arduous negotiations, the specter of harmful <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers rising on our northern and southern borders was finally gone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So we thought. But a year later, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has yet to come into effect. That's mainly because the U.S. Congress has yet to approve it. The main inaction is in the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who earlier this month said, \"I would like to see it done this year,\" has since indicated the House probably won't stick to that schedule.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Pelosi should use all means at her disposal to see that it does. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., tells us, \"I think we have time, and we have bipartisan support.\" What is needed, he says, is a recognition by House members that in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, \"you don't get everything you want.\" Compromise is the name of the game.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new accord, also signed by Mexico's then-President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, doesn't live up to Trump's boast of being \"the largest, most significant, modern and balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement in history.\" But it would preserve a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone that has boosted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, promoted economic efficiencies and lowered costs for consumers. And the USMCA includes some useful improvements over the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So let's all agree: This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact isn't perfect -- as if others are. But it's better than the status quo, and better than any plausible alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting off approval until 2020 would make Democrats complicit in the needless <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> uncertainty that Trump has created.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His tariff policies in particular discourage investment and hiring, and make business planning far more difficult than it should be. Leaving USMCA on the shelf also could provoke the mercurial president to simply abandon <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a step that would create chaos in the North American marketplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>American farmers, whose net farm income has plunged by 50% since 2013, have enough trouble lately with bad weather and low prices. They don't need the additional stress of wondering whether they'll be able to sell to Mexico and Canada -- which together bought $2.8 billion worth of Illinois' agricultural goods last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>USMCA also would help Midwest factory workers -- and increase their numbers. The Washington Post reports that: Automakers would face the biggest changes once the new agreement takes effect. The USMCA requires more made-in-the-USA content and mandates that 40% of each vehicle be produced by workers earning $16 per hour -- a provision that is likely to draw jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi's delay in advancing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal invites Republican criticism that the Democratic-controlled House is too obsessed with impeachment to take care of other matters that have a more direct bearing on the lives of most Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Pelosi has insisted that her members \"can walk and chew gum.\" But right now it looks as though they are forfeiting an easy achievement in their pursuit of something unattainable -- Trump's removal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>An analysis by the International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission, an independent federal agency, concluded that it would stimulate economic growth and job creation across \"all broad industry sectors within the U.S. economy.\" The total yield, by the agency's calculation: a $68.2 billion increase in gross domestic product and 176,000 additional jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, Trump and Pelosi were sniping at each other: Trump complained to reporters that the USMCA was \"sitting on Nancy Pelosi's desk.\" The speaker retorted that she's awaiting some final decisions from Trump's U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe so. Maybe, too, she could ask one of her staffers to get final answers. Fifteen months after Trump cut this deal, all those Midwest farmers and factory workers aren't looking for House Democrats' excuses. They've waited too long for a simple action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Going into an election year, Democrats can look distracted by impeachment and inattentive to Americans' economic concerns. Or they can take the USMCA win and prove the doubters wrong.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAPTION: Photo: Speaker Nancy Pelosi's House has not advanced the USMCA.
