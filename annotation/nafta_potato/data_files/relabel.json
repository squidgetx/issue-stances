{"id": "1468227122.xml", "text": "<h2>It's Time for Nafta 2.0</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twenty years ago this month President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement into law. If there is one thing supporters and critics of this pact have always agreed on, it is the size of the stakes. In November 1993, Mr. Clinton, facing fierce opposition within his party, implored Congress to pass <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a vote for the country's future, a sign that \"we still have confidence in ourselves and our potential.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The agreement to eliminate tariffs and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico has delivered undeniable benefits. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and Canada has tripled to more than $1 trillion a year, supporting millions of American jobs. The U.S. exported more last year to Mexico than to Brazil, Russia, India and China combined; and more to Canada, with 35 million people, than to the European Union, with 500 million.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet today the U.S. and the region are facing a changing international landscape for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment. It brings new risks but also opportunities to strengthen our economic recovery. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> at 20 needs <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 -- a new version of expanded <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and cooperation to help the three member nations better compete with Asia and Europe. Regional free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> can help re-energize our sluggish economy, creating growth and reducing inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two decades ago, North American free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was an idea ahead of its time. Never before had two developed economies attempted a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with a developing country. Signed by President George H.W. Bush, Mexican President Carlos Salinas, and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Dec. 17, 1992, the agreement survived because of an extraordinary act of bipartisanship in Washington. After taking office in January 1993, Mr. Clinton, in a signature moment of his presidency, defied parts of his political base who claimed the treaty would destroy U.S. jobs and won approval by Congress with more Republican than Democratic votes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also opened the door for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements across Latin America, a catalyst for economic and political reforms. Mexico was transformed from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open, and it subsequently threw off decades of one-party rule. Today, U.S. products make up 40% of the contents of goods imported here from Mexico (compared with 4% in goods imported from China). An integrated market boosts exports and imports, and helps keep good jobs at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But there have been unexpected roadblocks. The 9/11 attacks shifted the priority at U.S. borders to security, and away from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. It hasn't shifted back. Concern about illegal immigration and the explosion of drug-related violence in Mexico has meant that billions of dollars have been spent on our borders not to facilitate the movement of goods but to prevent the movement of people. Many Americans support those measures, while many Mexicans oppose them, reflecting persistent distrust between our populations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s unfinished business is also visible in antiquated infrastructure and regulation. For almost a decade leaders of the three countries have endorsed greater regulatory cooperation, with little to show for the efforts. Although $1 billion in goods crosses the U.S.-Mexico border every day, bottlenecks cost millions. All this contributes to less <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. North America's share of the world's product, which rose sharply during the first years of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, has been in steady decline and is now roughly 25%. We are not as competitive as we need to be.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several reasons now is the right time for new thinking. The border is largely secure and net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero. Immigration reform is back on the U.S. agenda, if tenuously. The Senate's immigration bill includes $6.5 billion for border security. How much should we invest in cross-border <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A new era of energy innovation is also rapidly spreading across North America. The U.S. is forecast to pass Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil producer in 2015. Under President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico is implementing reforms that will allow private capital and competition into the state-owned oil industry. Meanwhile, President Obama has set the goal of doubling U.S. exports between 2010 and 2015. On Nov. 8, the president called for billions of infrastructure investment to increase exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is in negotiations over two major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving 11 countries that include Japan (but not China) and a trans-Atlantic <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Europe. These negotiations are a chance to improve regional competitiveness through convergence of North American regulations, bringing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in line with these new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> initiatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic shifts and cultural understanding are making North America more interconnected. The number of Hispanics living in the U.S. has doubled since 1990 to more than 50 million, two-thirds of whom have Mexican heritage. A recent American University poll released in October showed that there remains widespread support among Canadians (80%), Mexicans (74%) and Americans (65%) for regional free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still a work in progress. But as we search for ways to reinvigorate the U.S. economy, freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and greater cooperation with our North American neighbors is a clear winner, and perhaps an opportunity for another bipartisan moment in Washington.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. McLarty served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff, counselor, and special envoy for the Americas.

{"id": "1822753517.xml", "text": "<h2>How Mexicans See Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>TOLUCA, Mexico -- In this industrial city near the Mexican capital, workers gather outside the gates of a sprawling Chrysler plant for a late shift assembling Dodge Journey S.U.V.s. It's a sought-after job, with autoworkers in Mexico earning an average of about $5 an hour, compared with the nation's minimum wage of less than $4 for the whole day. Yet it is a fifth of what autoworkers make in Detroit, and that has helped Mexico become a global powerhouse in car production. The finished products can be seen in the parking lot: thousands of shiny new S.U.V.s, black, white, silver, red, waiting to be shipped around the planet, particularly to the United States, where Americans bought 100,000 Journeys last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scenes like this are at the heart of the populist, anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rage driving Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign. His central promise: to rewrite or scrap the 22-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which he blames for sending countless jobs overseas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And while Hillary Clinton knocks most of Mr. Trump's positions, she has echoed this one. \"Too often past <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn't pan out,\" she said in a speech near Detroit. The president of the United Auto Workers, Dennis Williams, said she promised him that she would renegotiate the deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How these attacks on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> translate into policy is one of the most important questions to come out of this election. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-bashing rattles Mexican businesses in a nation that has built its economy on the accord and depends on commerce with its northern neighbor for a third of its income. Last year, Mexico exported $316 billion worth of goods and services to the United States, a sizable chunk of the country's gross domestic product of $1.1 trillion. Amid the election, some companies have delayed related investments, a Mexican financial newspaper reported. And when Mr. Trump goes up in the polls, Mexico's peso sinks in value.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mexican leaders mock Mr. Trump's demand that they pay for a border wall, they have taken his calls to renegotiate, if not scrap, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> more seriously, especially as their leader has done little to push back. In July, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto held a news conference with President Obama in which he said there was space to \"modernize\" and \"update\" the agreement. And last month, he raised no objections when Mr. Trump stood in Mexico's presidential palace and promised a rewrite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not, however, universally beloved in Mexico, and the presidential candidates' anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talk has reignited criticism of the treaty, with some opponents claiming, among other things, that it devastates Mexican agriculture by flooding the country with cheap American corn. In August, tens of thousands of small farmers gathered in Mexico City with demands that included the redrafting of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- a move that Mexico's economy secretary, Ildefonso Guajardo, has warned could open a \"Pandora's box.\" Indeed, the prospect of a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has pundits weighing in with calls to put everything from energy to immigration into a new draft.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In July, the polling company Buend\u00eda y Laredo asked Mexicans if they would like to leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> altogether. A solid 52 percent said they were against a \"Mexit\" from the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc, but it was significant that 33 percent said they favored an out, despite how many jobs depended on it. The survey showed similar attitudes to those in Britain toward the European Union; those with the least education were the most against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; college students were the most in favor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> politics are as complex south of the border as they are in the north. Its advocates see it as a cornerstone of Mexico's opening to the world; its detractors, as a neoliberal tool of imperialist gringos. Some credit it -- or blame it -- for most of what has happened here over the last two decades, from the country's moving to a multiparty democracy, to millions trekking to El Norte, to violent drug gangs ravaging border towns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the United States economy 10 times the size of Mexico's, the effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are far greater on this side of the river. It has physically reshaped Mexico's landscape, from its growing industrial cities to its emptying farming villages. It rocket-boosted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the countries, from $104 billion in 1994 to $583 billion last year, representing everything from sparkplugs to airplanes to Christmas trees. Thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico has become the biggest carmaker in Latin America, overtaking Brazil in 2014.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But despite these gains, the Mexican economy is sluggish compared with that of developing countries such as India and China. It has grown by an average of 2.5 percent a year since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, a similar level to the decade before it, and below that of the boom years of the 1960s.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Holding a magnifying glass to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> reveals other nuances. Mr. Trump likes to point out that Mexico sells more than it buys from the United States, by $58 billion last year. But many of the companies exporting from Mexico are American-owned, so much of the profit goes back north. Chrysler opened its factory in Toluca all the way back in 1968, aiming for the Mexican market, then invested $1 billion more in it in 2006 when it had access to American car buyers. And while American corn does flow south, Mexico exported more farm goods to the United States than it imported last year. Small farmers here may be losing out as much to large Mexican ranches as they are to American agribusiness, especially those small farmers harvesting the millions of avocados that Americans scarf up in their game-day guacamole.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These nuances illustrate how interconnected the North American economy has become, and how difficult rewriting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would be. Perhaps politicians will use the opportunity to add provisions on labor and the environment to the agreement, a longstanding demand by critics that could have a positive impact. But a major renegotiation that would satisfy the autoworkers, small farmers and other aggrieved groups in both countries would be a herculean task -- assuming the next American president really goes there, whatever he or she promises at election time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>IOAN GRILLO   Ioan Grillo is the author of \"Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\" and a contributing opinion writer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Farmers Protesting Against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 2003.

{"id": "1841625677.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's Options in a Trump Trade War; The country could impose retaliatory duties and look for new trade partners.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If the sharp selloff of the Mexican peso after the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump were set to music it might sound like a funeral dirge, the dearly departed being the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). The peso has fallen to an all-time low of more than 20 to the dollar, and on Thursday the Bank of Mexico raised its benchmark interest rate to stem the bleeding.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico investors are worried that Mr. Trump might actually believe--as he argued in his campaign--that U.S. productivity growth and job creation depend on renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to discourage U.S. investments south of the border. But Mexico won't easily yield to a new deal that limits its access to U.S. markets in order to make it less attractive as a destination for capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Trump counters with tariff hikes in violation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mexico is likely to respond with its own duty increases. It did this with $2.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. export products in 2009 when the U.S. failed to live up to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligation in trucking. There is even the possibility that Mr. Trump will carry out his threat to tear up the agreement. There are no winners in any of these narratives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the 23 years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was launched, Mexico has cultivated a middle-class, a more-vibrant democracy and a diversified economy far less dependent than it once was on oil. The country now sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war would be an economic disaster and open the door to political instability.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thus it won't be so easy for Mr. Trump to bully the neighbors. National pride will play a role in stiffening the Mexican spine, and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's government is signaling that it intends to face any crisis by deepening structural reforms, getting its fiscal house in order and looking more aggressively for new trading partners. The unspoken message to Mr. Trump is that if he plays the protectionist game, Mexico is ready to raise the stakes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s demise would be bad for the U.S. too, although the U.S. stock market rally suggests that the fear of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war is overblown. Protectionist steel and textile tycoon Wilbur Ross is rumored to be in line for a job in the new administration. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r from Indiana, which in 2015 exported $4.8 billion in goods to Mexico, its second-largest export market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>From time to time Mr. Trump has had flashes of sanity on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. In a joint press conference with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in August, then-candidate Trump spoke of the need to \"keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some expect the Trump administration to find a way to largely leave <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone while it works on legitimate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues like China's practice of intellectual-property theft. Mexico seems to want to help in this face-saving endeavor and has wisely decided not to escalate the rhetoric. It doesn't need to: Americans have plenty to lose if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many U.S. corporations are now heavily invested in supply chains that crisscross the continent to create globally competitive products. These support millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Saying goodbye to duty-free access to Mexico under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> also would hit U.S. agricultural exports hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters on Nov. 10 that his government is \"ready to talk so we can explain the strategic importance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> for the region. Here we're not talking about . . . renegotiating it, we're simply talking about dialogue.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also said Mexico will look for new markets, adding to more than 40 existing free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. It had hoped for expanded opportunities via the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that includes the U.S. and much of Asia. But President Obama wasn't able to get TPP through Congress and Mr. Trump has promised to kill it. Mr. Guajardo said that Mexico will pursue the possibility of completing a smaller TPP with the countries that are expected to have ratified it by the end of 2016. He named Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. Australia would probably be eager to replace the U.S. as Mexico's chief food supplier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of this would make up for the loss of U.S. market access under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which means that increasing Mexican competitiveness is urgent. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto got historic constitutional reforms in energy and telecommunications through his Congress in 2013. Opening these markets to competition will attract capital and improve the infrastructure for producers but implementation takes time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately the government's debt burden has increased sharply in recent years and taxes have gone up, adding to disappointing economic performance. These are mistakes that Mexican policy makers cannot afford if Mr. Trump plays chicken with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to O'Grady@wsj.com.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "1865144711.xml", "text": "<h2>MONDAY BUSINESS; THE AGENDA: AGRICULTURE; Farmers fearful of a food fight; A possible trade war could curb their exports, especially for California growers</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It took Donald Trump 71 days to settle on an Agriculture secretary after winning the presidency. It took him 72 hours after that to unsettle much of the agriculture industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the freshly inaugurated president withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty, a 12-nation pact that was expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports by more than $7 billion annually over the coming decades, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president was thinking about financing his long-promised southern border wall with a 20% tax on \"imports from deficit countries, like Mexico.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That announcement, followed by a flurry of clarifications and caveats, appears to be part of a plan for a massive tax overhaul aimed at altering the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance country by country. U.S. farmers, who get about 20% of their annual revenue from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, could be hit especially hard if countries choose to retaliate. Consumers, too, would suffer if a border tax increases the price of foreign food.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. agricultural and related products -- including dairy, meat, forestry products and fish -- amass a $5-billion <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with the world, according to the Department of Agriculture. Among the biggest sellers are soybeans, grains, dairy products, meat, nuts, hay, wine, fruit and vegetables.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Farmers and ranchers from Florida to Washington have experienced double-digit growth in many of those commodities since the mid-1990s, according to the USDA.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, exports of corn from Iowa to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-agreement countries more than doubled in the last decade, with more than three-quarters of the state's shipments going to Mexico, a partner in the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Louisiana's exports of soybeans to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-agreement partners rose 15% in the same period, driven largely by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Latin American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But no state has more at stake than California. It leads the country in agricultural revenue, and its farmers and ranchers are twice as dependent on foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as the country as a whole. Last year, growers in the state earned $21 billion from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- about 44% of their total revenue, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Without California, the U.S. would not have exported a single tree nut, table grape, raisin, olive oil drum, garlic clove, artichoke, fig, date, kiwi or dried plum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Golden State last year also exported more than 90% of the wine, processing tomatoes, avocados, carrots, broccoli and celery in the U.S. California's berries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, melons, oranges, lemons, tangerines, mandarins, spinach, lettuce, seasonal vegetables and rice constituted more than half the U.S. exports of those commodities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of the countries most responsible for the United States' overall <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit are California agriculture's best customers -- China and Mexico among them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As recently as Jan. 28, Trump accused China of protecting its exports by depressing the value of its currency, the yuan. He has called the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which links the U.S. with Canada and Mexico, \"the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever\" and threatened to tear it up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The comments drew quick reaction from California officials, even as they scratched their collective heads over what Trump actually intended to do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Altering <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"starts to create some market turmoil, which ripples out through the supply chain -- not just the farmer but the transporter, the processor, the ports, longshoremen. It affects a lot of jobs,\" said Josh Rolph, manager of federal policy for the California Farm Bureau Federation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The U.S.-Mexico <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relationship is very important. We would be concerned to see that relationship negatively affected,\" said Ken Barbic, senior director of federal government affairs for Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico supplied the U.S. with more than $5 billion in fresh vegetables, $1.4 billion in processed fruits and vegetables, $4.5 billion in fruit and $2.8 billion in beer and wine last year, according to the USDA. All could be targets of a tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>California's top exports to Mexico -- dairy, forestry products, prepared foods and fresh fruit -- could find themselves in the political crosshairs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Likewise, taxes could be imposed on Canada's imports of wood products, processed foods and fish, and the country potentially could retaliate against the fruits and vegetables, wine and beer, nuts and processed foods that California exports north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even a small alteration in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- a strike, slowdown or other protest in Mexico, for example -- could hit consumers, who expect fruits and vegetables in the produce aisles year-round, regardless of growing seasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the avocado: Last year, prices skyrocketed when Mexico could not harvest them during a few weeks when there was a gap in U.S. supply, itself beset by drought. Restaurants and sandwich shops began charging extra, guacamole disappeared from cafe plates and consumers griped.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A similar weather problem in Mexico lately has driven up the price of asparagus, a crop that has shifted to Mexico since the passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Unable to compete, California growers have cut production of the crop by 70% since the mid-1990s, according to the state Department of Food and Agriculture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last time the U.S.-Mexico relationship got rocky, it cost U.S. growers close to $1 billion in lost sales from 2009 to 2011, said USDA economist Steven Zahniser. That's when Mexico launched retaliatory tariffs against dozens of U.S. agricultural products, over U.S. reluctance to comply with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> provisions to allow Mexican trucks into the States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Resolving a tiff in one economic sector by using food as a pawn is not an unusual tactic. Food frequently bears a steeper penalty in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars because it carries a lot of political clout. It doesn't last as long as politicians can argue, for one. And few people riot over the price of a smartphone, laptop or car, but they've been known to overthrow governments over an increase in the price of food or shortages of staples.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Russia continues to ban food imports from the European Union, after those countries sanctioned Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. In 2015, Canada and Mexico were set to retaliate against U.S. wine, fruits, meat, cheese and dozens of other items over a dispute involving meat labeling.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'll tell you where I'm most worried about: It's not between-country negotiations; it's when we get a mercantilist, deal-by-deal kind of mentality,\" said Daniel Sumner, a resource economist who heads UC Davis' Agricultural Issues Center. \"You don't want your president telling businesses how to run their business.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, though, cajoling businesses appears to be Trump's approach. Last month, he threatened to tax General Motors over its manufacture of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback in Mexico. GM countered that all of the Cruze sedans are built in Ohio, although several thousand Cruze hatchbacks from Mexican factories are sold here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump also threatened a 35% tax on Ford vehicles if more of them were made in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has yet to mention taxing avocados.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>geoffrey.mohan@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Twitter: @LATgeoffmohan</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: CALIFORNIA leads the U.S. in agricultural revenue; its farmers and ranchers rely heavily on foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.

{"id": "1865151801.xml", "text": "<h2>Executive Power Run Amok</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Berkeley, Calif. -- Faced with President Trump's executive orders suspending immigration from several Muslim nations and ordering the building of a border wall, and his threats to terminate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, even Alexander Hamilton, our nation's most ardent proponent of executive power, would be worried by now.Article II of the Constitution vests the president with \"the executive power,\" but does not define it. Most of the Constitution instead limits that power, as with the president's duty \"to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" or divides that power with Congress, as with making treaties or appointing Supreme Court justices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hamilton argued that good government and \"energy in the executive\" went hand in hand. In The Federalist No. 70, he wrote that the framers, to encourage \"decision, activity, secrecy and dispatch,\" entrusted the executive power in a unified branch headed by a single person, the president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of Hamilton's intellectual admirers today endorse the theory of the unitary executive, which holds that the Constitution grants the president all of the remaining executive powers that existed at the time of the founding. These include the powers to conduct foreign affairs, protect the national security, interpret and execute the law and manage all lower-level federal officers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As an official in the Justice Department, I followed in Hamilton's footsteps, advising that President George W. Bush could take vigorous, perhaps extreme, measures to protect the nation after the Sept. 11 attacks, including invading Afghanistan, opening the Guant\u00e1namo detention center and conducting military trials and enhanced interrogation of terrorist leaders. Likewise, I supported President Barack Obama when he drew on this source of constitutional power for drone attacks and foreign electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even I have grave concerns about Mr. Trump's uses of presidential power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the campaign, Mr. Trump gave little sign that he understood the constitutional roles of the three branches, as when he promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would investigate Hillary Clinton. (Judge Neil M. Gorsuch will not see this as part of his job description.) In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump did not acknowledge that his highest responsibility, as demanded by his oath of office, is to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\" Instead, he declared his duty to represent the wishes of the people and end \"American carnage,\" seemingly without any constitutional restraint.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While my robust vision of the presidency supports some of Mr. Trump's early executive acts -- presidents have the power to terminate international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example -- others are more dubious. Take his order to build a wall along the border with Mexico, and his suggestion that he will tax Mexican imports or currency transfers to pay for it. The president has no constitutional authority over border control, which the Supreme Court has long found rests in the hands of Congress. Under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress can fund the construction of a wall, a fence or even a walking path along the border. And the president cannot slap a tax or tariff on Mexican imports without Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor can Mr. Trump pull the United States out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, because Congress made the deal with Mexico and Canada by statute. Presidents have no authority to cancel tariff and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> laws unilaterally.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration has driven Mr. Trump even deeper into the constitutional thickets. Even though his executive order halting immigration from seven Muslim nations makes for bad policy, I believe it falls within the law. But after the order was issued, his adviser Rudolph Giuliani disclosed that Mr. Trump had initially asked for \"a Muslim ban,\" which would most likely violate the Constitution's protection for freedom of religion or its prohibition on the state establishment of religion, or both -- no mean feat. Had Mr. Trump taken advantage of the resources of the executive branch as a whole, not just a few White House advisers, he would not have rushed out an ill-conceived policy made vulnerable to judicial challenge.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, for her stated intention not to defend his immigration policy, also raises concerns. Even though the constitutional text is silent on the issue, long historical practice and Supreme Court precedent have recognized a presidential power of removal. Mr. Trump was thus on solid footing, because attorneys general have a duty to defend laws and executive orders, so long as they have a plausible legal grounding. But the White House undermined its valid use of the removal power by accusing Ms. Yates of being \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\" Such irrelevant ad hominem accusations suggest a misconception of the president's authority of removal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A successful president need not have a degree in constitutional law. But he should understand the Constitution's grant of executive power. He should share Hamilton's vision of an energetic president leading the executive branch in a unified direction, rather than viewing the government as the enemy. He should realize that the Constitution channels the president toward protecting the nation from foreign threats, while cooperating with Congress on matters at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Otherwise, our new president will spend his days overreacting to the latest events, dissipating his political capital and haphazardly wasting the executive's powers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>JOHN YOO   John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of \"Crisis and Command: A History of Executive Power From George Washington to George W.

{"id": "1871366920.xml", "text": "<h2>A fresh way to do the math on trade</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing you need to know about the latest controversy involving President Trump's alleged attempt to manipulate economic data for political purposes is that Bernie Sanders probably would have done the same thing, and quite possibly Hillary Clinton, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mainstream economists recoiled at a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that said Trump appointees at the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative want official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances between the United States and various countries rejiggered to make bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits seem larger - and, by implication, Trump's protectionist policies more necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his blog, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and author of a leading economics textbook, responded simply: \"You've got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Per long-standing international economic practice, the headline figure for the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and any other nation has been expressed as the difference between two numbers: the value of U.S. imports from that trading partner and the value of U.S. exports to it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, however, left-wing critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have said that this data point distorts the deals' actual impact. In 2014, 14 Democratic members of the House - including current party-chair candidate and 2016 Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) - wrote to President Barack Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative demanding that he adopt the same math that Trump is reportedly contemplating. One of the first to defend Trump this week was Lori Wallach, a left-wing anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> activist at Public Citizen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do they have a point? Well, kinda sorta. The headline numbers lump together made-in-the-USA exports with goods produced in third countries that enter the United States on their way elsewhere. Example: Samsung TVs from South Korea land at Long Beach, Calif., and get trucked to Tijuana, perhaps after a little repackaging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since these \"re-exports\" by definition aren't made by American workers, critics argue that it's more accurate, in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s impact on U.S. jobs, to focus on the difference between purely made-in-the-USA exports and imports that remain in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would dramatically alter reported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with Mexico and Canada, to which nearly half of all U.S. re-exports go - since those nations border us and don't have tariffs, thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 2016 U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico would have been not $63.1 billion but $115.4 billion, the Journal noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that, no matter how you count it, a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit (or surplus) per se is neither good nor bad - unfashionable though it may be to restate that basic tenet of economic theory amid the current left-right protectionist convergence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> undoubtedly displaced American workers in certain sectors, just as it also created new job opportunities elsewhere - including in the vast logistical chain through which re-exports flow. And it enabled U.S. consumers to access various desirable goods at lower prices than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits are diffuse and the job losses concentrated and acutely felt, of course - a fact of politics, not economics, that Trump's data massage seems designed to exploit. (No final decision has been made, the administration told the Journal.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no legitimate full-disclosure issue here, since the data Trump and his progressive bedfellows prefer is already available from the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission. What they want is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative's imprimatur on their ideology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the rigid distinction between U.S.-made goods - which \"create jobs\" - and all others is breaking down due to global supply chains.

{"id": "1871409028.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump's attempt to massage economic data isn't new. But there's a better way.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first thing you need to know about the latest controversy involving President Trump's alleged attempt to manipulate economic data for political purposes is that Bernie Sanders probably would have done the same thing, and quite possibly Hillary Clinton, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mainstream economists recoiled at a Wall Street Journal report Tuesday that said Trump appointees at the Office of the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative want official <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances between the United States and various countries rejiggered to make bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits seem larger -- and, by implication, Trump's protectionist policies more necessary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On his blog, Harvard University's Greg Mankiw, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and author of a leading economics textbook, responded simply: \"You've got to be kidding me.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Per long-standing international economic practice, the headline figure for the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and any other nation has been expressed as the difference between two numbers: the value of U.S. imports from that trading partner and the value of U.S. exports to it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For years, however, left-wing critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements have said that this data point distorts the deals' actual impact. In 2014, 14 Democratic members of the House -- including current party-chair candidate and 2016 Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) -- wrote to President Barack Obama's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative demanding that he adopt the same math that Trump is reportedly contemplating. One of the first to defend Trump this week was Lori Wallach, a left-wing anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> activist at Public Citizen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Do they have a point? Well, kinda sorta. The headline numbers lump together made-in-the-USA exports with goods produced in third countries that enter the United States on their way elsewhere. Example: Samsung TVs from South Korea land at Long Beach, Calif., and get trucked to Tijuana, perhaps after a little repackaging.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since these \"re-exports\" by definition aren't made by American workers, critics argue that it's more accurate, in terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s impact on U.S. jobs, to focus on the difference between purely made-in-the-USA exports and imports that remain in the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This would dramatically alter reported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances with Mexico and Canada, to which nearly half of all U.S. re-exports go -- since those nations border us and don't have tariffs, thanks to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The 2016 U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico would have been not $63.1 billion but $115.4 billion, the Journal noted.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that, no matter how you count it, a bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit (or surplus) per se is neither good nor bad -- unfashionable though it may be to restate that basic tenet of economic theory amid the current left-right protectionist convergence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> undoubtedly displaced American workers in certain sectors, just as it also created new job opportunities elsewhere -- including in the vast logistical chain through which re-exports flow. And it enabled U.S. consumers to access various desirable goods at lower prices than they could have otherwise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The benefits are diffuse and the job losses concentrated and acutely felt, of course -- a fact of politics, not economics, that Trump's data massage seems designed to exploit. (No final decision has been made, the administration told the Journal.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's no legitimate full-disclosure issue here, since the data Trump and his progressive bedfellows prefer is already available from the U.S. International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Commission. What they want is the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative's imprimatur on their ideology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the rigid distinction between U.S.-made goods -- which \"create jobs\" -- and all others is breaking down due to global supply chains. Economist Lee Ohanian of UCLA has reported that the production process for certain goods takes them back and forth over the U.S.-Mexico border 14 times before they're ready for market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many imports from China are assembled from inputs made in other countries.

{"id": "1878595149.xml", "text": "<h2>Nafta Has Made Mexico a Better Place; Civil society, long neutralized during the PRI autarky, has awakened.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One common beef with the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is that 23 years after it went live Mexico remains a developing country. Because Mexico's standard of living is still below that of its northern counterparts and a weak rule of law persists, critics argue that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet in this analysis the fault lies with the expectations, not the outcome. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was never going to convert Mexico into a Spanish-speaking Switzerland in one generation. On the other hand, few would have predicted the civil, political and economic achievements of the past two decades. That this has happened while American drug consumers have been financing vicious organized-crime networks in the country is even more impressive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the news in January that Ernesto Canales, the anticorruption czar in the Mexican state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, had jailed former Gov. Rodrigo Medina of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on charges of corruption during his term from 2009-15.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Putting a powerful member of the PRI behind bars, even temporarily, was a first for the state. Mr. Medina was released the next day by a federal judge on a procedural technicality but he still faces trial on corruption charges that could result in a sentence of up to 36 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No matter the outcome, Mr. Canales told the Mexican media, politicians are now on notice. Making a play on words in Spanish with the Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" he warned that Mexico's \"100 years of impunity\" are over.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Thirty years ago Mexico was a one-party state run by the PRI. The authoritarian machine, which had been in power since 1929, had industrialized the country and kept the lid on civilian lawlessness much like Gen. Francisco Franco did in Spain from 1939-75. But the corporatist model, in which the state owned or controlled business and labor organizations, held the nation back. Fiscal mismanagement spawned successive bouts of devaluation and hyperinflation. A repressive state apparatus contained social unrest.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the 1980s Mexico looked more like Egypt--poor, backward and undemocratic--than like a member of Western civilization. Democratic capitalists on both sides of the border wanted change. But as the \"Arab Spring\" demonstrated, the transformation from tyranny to liberty requires more than desire.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political reform was not on the agenda when PRI President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in 1988. But the economy was in bad shape, and renewed growth depended on opening <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The U.S. already had a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with Canada. President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney agreed to pursue a continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment treaty with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and brought commitments to competition, privatization and foreign capital. Cross-border commercial relationships required improvements in civil law. For the first time in more than six decades, Mexico had the fundamentals of a market economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mexican economist Luis de la Calle and political scientist Luis Rubio show in their 2010 book, \"Mexico: A Middle Class Society</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>,\" today's consumption patterns indicate that the nation is no longer \"poor.\" But this is about more than an increase in creature comforts for a wider number of Mexicans. It is also about the spread of middle-class values in education, civil rights and culture.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corruption went unacknowledged in old Mexico because graft was a party entitlement, the press was controlled by the state and whistleblowers were easily ruined. But 6\u00bd years after the birth of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the PRI lost executive power at the ballot box.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the Journal's Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba and Juan Montes reported</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>earlier this month, some state politicians read the end of PRI dominance at the federal level as merely the decentralization of corruption. But they didn't count on how civil society, which had been neutralized during PRI autarky, also awakened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 2015 Jaime Rodr\u00edguez, a political outsider with no party, was elected governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n on a single issue: ending corruption. He named Mr. Canales to head an independent office, inside the attorney general's office, to investigate corruption.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During a visit to the state capital of Monterrey in February, I met with seven members of the Canales team. They shared with me some of their findings, including what they allege was a sophisticated scheme of \"simulation,\" in which chosen contractors created duplicate billing for infrastructure projects during the Medina term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite a federal prohibition on the right to subpoena state records, Mr. Canales's office collected enough evidence to charge, among other things, that Mr. Medina's administration signed thousands of overpriced public-works contracts with favored companies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Medina maintains his innocence. The trial is expected in the second half of this year.

{"id": "1888402285.xml", "text": "<h2>Mr. Trump's 10-Second Convictions</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Donald Trump has made so many promises, from wiping out the national debt -- a pledge dismissed last week by his own budget director as \"hyperbole\" -- to changing the name of the Denali peak back to Mount McKinley, that it can be hard to keep track of how many he's breaking. So here's a partial list of his reversals and revisions, large and small, to date:SYRIA In 2013, when Barack Obama sought congressional approval for military action in response to President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria, Mr. Trump rejected any intervention, in a storm of tweets. On April 6, without consulting Congress, the administration attacked Syria, with the surreal explanation that Mr. Obama's \"weakness and irresolution\" made it necessary.RUSSIA Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Russia, complicit for years in Mr. Assad's brutality; he has even encouraged its meddling in the affairs of other nations, like the United States. On April 5, under heavy fire for his campaign's ties with Russia, he declared relations with Russia worse than ever, \"because they're aligned\" with Syria. In another reversal, he denies knowing Vladimir Putin.NATO For months, Mr. Trump condemned NATO as \"obsolete,\" falsely claiming that it doesn't fight terrorism. Last week, after meeting with NATO's secretary general, Mr. Trump declared, \"It's no longer obsolete ... they made a change and now they do fight terrorism.\" NATO didn't change; Mr. Trump's mind did.HEALTH CARE Mr. Trump vowed not to cut Medicare or Medicaid, then embraced a Republican Obamacare replacement that would drastically raise costs for older Americans. It failed. Now he says he'll force Democrats to negotiate by cutting Obamacare's health insurance subsidies for seven million poor people.TAX REFORM After his health care overhaul failed, Mr. Trump said he'd pivot to tax reform. Last week he roiled markets by saying he might pivot back to health care (see above).TRAVEL Criticizing Mr. Obama's summer vacation, Mr. Trump said that as president he \"would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done.\" Thanks to his weekends in Mar-a-Lago, he's on target to ring up more bills for travel in his first year than Mr. Obama did in eight years. (And, yes, he used to accuse the Obamas of extravagantly spending taxpayer money.)PRESCRIPTION DRUGS In December, the newly elected president pledged to use his fabled deal-making powers to \"bring down drug prices.\" After he met with drug company chiefs in the White House in January, that promise evaporated.TAX LOOPHOLES Mr. Trump said last year that he would close \"special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\" He then picked Stephen Schwarzman, a financier who has compared closing those loopholes to Hitler's invasion of Poland, to lead a White House \"strategic and policy forum.\"CHINA Mr. Trump targeted China throughout the campaign, saying that on his first day he'd label it a currency manipulator and act to reverse its entry into the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization. Last week, after his first meeting with the Chinese president, he declared that China is no longer a currency manipulator, and said little about its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mr. Trump told workers in Michigan that on Day 1, \"A Trump administration will renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies. 100 percent.\" He's failed to take any action.THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed that as president he would give up his business. Instead, he passed day-to-day operations to his oldest sons, while he continues to receive regular updates; is able to withdraw profits; and travels to promote his properties, at taxpayer expense, through high-profile visits.THE FED Last year, Mr. Trump blasted the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates low for political purposes. Last week, he told The Wall Street Journal that he respects Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, adding, \"I do like a low-interest-rate policy.\"INCOME TAXES Mr. Trump first said he'd release his taxes after an audit, and then, after he was president. Two days after his inauguration, he reneged.EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS As a candidate, Mr. Trump made up his own numbers, putting unemployment rates as high as 42 percent, calling the government's statistics \"phony.\" As president he touts the official numbers, when they're good.EXPORT-IMPORT BANK In 2015, Mr. Trump slammed the export financing agency as \"featherbedding\" for politicians and big corporations. Last week, he called the Ex-Im Bank \"a very good thing,\" saying that \"lots of small companies are really helped.\"In some instances, President Trump has adopted, for the moment, more sensible positions than the sweeping, outlandish ones he took during the campaign. Some commentators point to the comforting possibility that his reversals mean that Mr. Trump is growing in office, adapting postures born of ignorance or political calculus as he meets the realities of governing.But then you'd have to overlook the nasty positions he's stuck to, as he caters to the oligarchs who surround him, builds his personal fortune and stirs the darker passions of his base. Why else would he break his promise to release his taxes or relinquish control of his business? Mr. Trump now surrounds himself with the bankers he once lambasted; he's lagged behind on promises of infrastructure jobs, manufacturing revival and health care, while opening up bidding on the wall. He's decried Syria's gas attack on \"beautiful babies\" but continues to bar Syria's children from America.To attribute the president's pirouettes to personal growth would also require ignoring what's actually staring us in the face -- that there is no foundation to this presidency. With his all-important ratings tanking, the reality-TV maestro is rewriting the script, enthusiastically swapping out any position in pursuit of a \"deal.\" He is revealing himself to be a tactical, transactional president, with no guiding convictions or principles beyond \"winning.\" Not winning for everyone, as he so famously promised. Winning for Mr. Trump.Democrats or House Freedom Caucus members, NATO members or Middle East dictators, potential allies or adversaries -- all must be deeply unsettled by the one clear pattern emerging here, a pattern that is consistent with Mr. Trump's treatment of others in private life, from his stiffing of his creditors to his swindling of students at Trump University: betrayal.And where does that leave the working-class voters who pinned their hopes on this man? They can live with what Mr. Trump calls successes, and hope that his interests align enough with theirs to achieve some peripheral benefit. Or they can press their legislators, and demand from Mr. Trump himself, that he stop spinning and start delivering.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARDDrawing (Drawing by Nicolas Ortega)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SYRIA In 2013, when Barack Obama sought congressional approval for military action in response to President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria, Mr. Trump rejected any intervention, in a storm of tweets.

Last week, after his first meeting with the Chinese president, he declared that China is no longer a currency manipulator, and said little about its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Mr. Trump told workers in Michigan that on Day 1, \"A Trump administration will renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and get a much better deal for our workers and our companies. 100 percent.\" He's failed to take any action.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed that as president he would give up his business. Instead, he passed day-to-day operations to his oldest sons, while he continues to receive regular updates; is able to withdraw profits; and travels to promote his properties, at taxpayer expense, through high-profile visits.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE FED Last year, Mr. Trump blasted the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates low for political purposes. Last week, he told The Wall Street Journal that he respects Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, adding, \"I do like a low-interest-rate policy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>INCOME TAXES Mr. Trump first said he'd release his taxes after an audit, and then, after he was president. Two days after his inauguration, he reneged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS As a candidate, Mr. Trump made up his own numbers, putting unemployment rates as high as 42 percent, calling the government's statistics \"phony.\" As president he touts the official numbers, when they're good.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>EXPORT-IMPORT BANK In 2015, Mr. Trump slammed the export financing agency as \"featherbedding\" for politicians and big corporations. Last week, he called the Ex-Im Bank \"a very good thing,\" saying that \"lots of small companies are really helped.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some instances, President Trump has adopted, for the moment, more sensible positions than the sweeping, outlandish ones he took during the campaign. Some commentators point to the comforting possibility that his reversals mean that Mr. Trump is growing in office, adapting postures born of ignorance or political calculus as he meets the realities of governing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But then you'd have to overlook the nasty positions he's stuck to, as he caters to the oligarchs who surround him, builds his personal fortune and stirs the darker passions of his base. Why else would he break his promise to release his taxes or relinquish control of his business? Mr. Trump now surrounds himself with the bankers he once lambasted; he's lagged behind on promises of infrastructure jobs, manufacturing revival and health care, while opening up bidding on the wall. He's decried Syria's gas attack on \"beautiful babies\" but continues to bar Syria's children from America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To attribute the president's pirouettes to personal growth would also require ignoring what's actually staring us in the face -- that there is no foundation to this presidency. With his all-important ratings tanking, the reality-TV maestro is rewriting the script, enthusiastically swapping out any position in pursuit of a \"deal.\" He is revealing himself to be a tactical, transactional president, with no guiding convictions or principles beyond \"winning.\" Not winning for everyone, as he so famously promised. Winning for Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats or House Freedom Caucus members, NATO members or Middle East dictators, potential allies or adversaries -- all must be deeply unsettled by the one clear pattern emerging here, a pattern that is consistent with Mr. Trump's treatment of others in private life, from his stiffing of his creditors to his swindling of students at Trump University: betrayal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And where does that leave the working-class voters who pinned their hopes on this man? They can live with what Mr. Trump calls successes, and hope that his interests align enough with theirs to achieve some peripheral benefit. Or they can press their legislators, and demand from Mr. Trump himself, that he stop spinning and start delivering.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Drawing (Drawing by Nicolas Ortega)</p>\n"}

{"id": "1909555580.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump is deluded about NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump administration is determined to renegotiate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>) -- which created a single market from Mexico's southern border to the Yukon -- but the main political appeal of this policy rests on a popular myth: that \"fair\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> requires the United States to have a surplus or balanced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with both Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We are supposed to feel especially aggrieved that Mexico regularly has a sizable surplus with us, $63.2 billion in goods in 2016, according to Commerce Department figures. This shows, as the president repeatedly has said, that U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> officials negotiated a bad deal for American firms and workers. Trump has promised to do much better.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will be hard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The whole theory of international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> assumes that countries specialize in products and services where they have a relative advantage. On a global basis, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> must balance; one country's imports are another country's exports. But some countries have surpluses and others have deficits, depending on their individual circumstances and histories.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all countries tried to balance their <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with all other countries, global commerce would break down. It would be too difficult to match every nation's export capacities with every nation's import needs. \"Even China, with its large global [<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>] surpluses, runs deficits with a large number of countries that produce primary products (Saudi Arabia for oil, Australia for iron ore, etc.),\" writes economist C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in a new paper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists generally discount the significance of bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balances (that is, balances between two countries) and focus on the overall effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on a country. Interestingly, Mexico and Canada prove the point.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Given all the nationalistic rhetoric about their unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices, you might expect that Mexico and Canada have recorded huge global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. Not so, says Bergsten.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, as a share of their economies (gross domestic product, or GDP), Mexico and Canada have larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits than the United States, he notes. In 2016, the U.S. current account deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP compared with current account deficits of 3.3 percent of GDP for Canada and 2.7 percent of GDP for Mexico. (The current account is a broad measure of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalances within <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> aren't as large as they seem. It's true -- as noted -- that the United States had a $63.2 billion deficit in goods <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (cars, computers, plastics) with Mexico. But the U.S. surplus on services (travel, transportation, consulting) was $7.6 billion, reducing the overall deficit with Mexico to $55.6 billion. On the same basis, covering goods and services, the United States had a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus of $12.5 billion with Canada in 2016.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So: The total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Canada and Mexico was $43.1 billion ($55.6 billion minus $12.5 billion). All <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- exports and imports -- between the United States and Canada and Mexico totaled $1.207 trillion in 2016. Our net deficit equaled 3.5 percent of total <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and about two-tenths of 1 percent of U.S. GDP. This hardly seems crushing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against that backdrop, the notion that either Canada or Mexico is going to offer the United States vast new markets in their countries -- without corresponding U.S. concessions -- seems wishful thinking. \"The administration appears to perceive Mexico and perhaps Canada as surplus countries,\" writes Bergsten, \"whereas they (more accurately) see themselves as deficit countries,\" seeking to increase exports or dampen imports. This is Trump's delusion.</p>\n"}
{"id": "1922366501.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump and the Nafta Talks</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No part of Donald Trump's 2016 run for president excited crowds more than his rants against Mexico, his promises to \"build the wall\" along the southern border, to make the neighbors pay for it, and to rewrite or scrap the 1994 North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rhetorically, President Trump has not stepped back very far from all that. He now says that he will build the wall first and figure how to get the money from Mexico later.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He understands that he won the presidency partly by making outrageous statements that kept him constantly in the news. But now that the serious business of negotiation on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is beginning, it appears that much of the craziness has been set aside.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and Canada have agreed to return to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiating table, and most of the objectives outlined in the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative's summary, released last week, are aimed not at destroying the 24-year-old pact but modernizing it. In many cases the U.S. is asking to open markets further on a reciprocal basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One objective is freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in agricultural products, which suggests that Canada's protected dairy and poultry markets will be on the table. The document also says the U.S. will aim for greater ease at the borders by \"streamlining\" customs procedures. A specific goal is to raise the value of goods that can enter duty-free in express-mail shipping to $800 from $50. The USTR doesn't make a big point of it, but this mail would presumably include products made in China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately some items on the Trump wish list would take the region backward economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hardly surprising that the administration has made it a priority to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada. It has the same wrongheaded obsession globally. But as the Journal explained in a March 10 editorial, \"How to Think About the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Deficit,\" a current-account deficit -- which includes <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> -- doesn't matter because it means there is a capital-account surplus. The dollars Americans spend on foreign-produced goods and services eventually must return to the U.S., usually via investments in U.S. assets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits with Mexico and Canada are even less relevant. In the introduction to its summary, the USTR claims that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits have exploded.\" Yet the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners is less than 13% of the total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> represents 30% of total U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Canada and Mexico are the largest export markets for the U.S., and the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits are nowhere proportional. It is also worth noting that the U.S. has had a surplus in services with Mexico averaging about $9 billion a year over the past three years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the goods side -- despite all the griping about deficits with Mexico and Canada -- continental free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> makes U.S. exports more attractive globally. By putting production facilities in all three <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> countries, American auto manufacturers, for example, can turn out cars and trucks that compete on price and quality all over the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This reduces the overall U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. All things being equal, the deficit would go down even more if all markets were further opened to U.S. exports. It follows that the ideal U.S. policy for an administration concerned about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits would be to work to reduce all barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a world of increasingly interconnected commerce supported by free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, American protectionists have come to rely heavily on antidumping and countervailing duties. Under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, when exporters are alleged to be selling unfairly -- leaning on government subsidies or pricing a product below market to destroy competitors -- any of the three countries can apply duties as a remedy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19, exporters can appeal those duties to an international arbitration panel. The USTR says it wants to eliminate Chapter 19 and instead send disputes to domestic courts. In the U.S. that would be the Court of International <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, where the Trump administration and its supporters undoubtedly feel American companies could expect a more favorable outcome than at a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet this would also mean that when Canada and Mexico slap antidumping duties on American products, exporters will have to go to domestic courts in those countries. The result is likely to be rising protectionism in all three markets and sand in the gears of the integrated North American economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This can only increase divisions, beyond economics, among the three countries at a time when a strong North American alliance is crucial to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere. Mexico has adopted a welcome human-rights policy by taking a strong position against the Venezuelan dictatorship. The U.S. should do what it can to build on this common ground.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USTR's objectives are largely constructive. But Trump protectionists have planted a few land mines in the otherwise valuable agenda. Americans have to hope that Canada and Mexico will defend the interests that all three partners have in a free and prosperous North America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Kill <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s Chapter 19 To Help American Industry\" -- WSJ Aug. 5, 2017)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Mary Anastasia O'Grady</p>\n"}
{"id": "1951409582.xml", "text": "<h2>Under Mr. Trump, America Surrenders</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans have long struggled with the question of whether this country should be more involved in world affairs, or less. The contest of ideas between internationalists and isolationists has been particularly fierce among Republicans, going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and continuing on to the beginning of World War II.But since the end of that war, whatever the differences in their priorities and points of emphasis, every president has chosen engagement rather than retreat, sometimes with surprising and positive outcomes. Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to \"the ash heap of history,\" went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America's commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America's guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been \"losing,\" a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put \"America first\" while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America's reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America's standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.He did so despite the advice of his top people -- the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs -- who say the agreement is in America's interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can't abide his predecessor's accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America's word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?America's European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump's decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.Most economists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.If revoked or substantially renegotiated, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his \"base\" -- the voters troubled by economic decline -- by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure.

Richard Nixon forged relations with communist China; Ronald Reagan, having consigned the Soviet Union to \"the ash heap of history,\" went on to negotiate arms control treaties with Mikhail Gorbachev. Even those like Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama who argued in various ways for scaling back America's commitments overseas insisted on a leadership role, if not the leadership role, in building an international system grounded in democratic and free-market principles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There have been plenty of mistakes and unforeseen developments that have tested the United States and raised questions about the wisdom of its policies. But, on the whole, the world has benefited greatly from America's guidance and its willingness to engage with allies at every step of the way. NATO, the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all part of the architecture of global security and development that American presidents helped create.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump is now taking a sledgehammer to that system. His argument, if that term can apply to such an inchoate position, is that America for too long has been \"losing,\" a situation he has set out to correct with nonnegotiable demands and gratuitous confrontations. He promises both to achieve more and to retrench. He promises to put \"America first\" while at the same time condemning it to a secondary role in global deliberations. It is a bizarre and contradictory policy: In seeking to liberate the United States from international obligations, and in waging war on multilateral institutions, he is not only destroying America's reputation as a trusted ally but also ceding the future to the very same aggressive powers, especially the authoritarian regimes of China and Russia, that he purports to protect Americans from. Meanwhile, his running feuds with the free press, the courts and Congress are diminishing America's standing as a bastion of constitutional liberties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The latest assaults occurred last week, when, in the space of a few days, Mr. Trump walked away from or threatened to walk away from an important agreement on Iran, a relationship with Unesco and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, painstakingly negotiated in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For more than a year Mr. Trump denigrated the Iran deal, under which Iran would substantially halt its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. On Friday he formally disavowed it by refusing to certify that Iran is in compliance. While he stopped short of explicitly killing the accord or rewriting it, the president did it great harm and kicked its fate to Congress, where its future is uncertain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He did so despite the advice of his top people -- the secretaries of defense and state and his military and intelligence chiefs -- who say the agreement is in America's interest; and despite the assurance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran 24/7 under a robust verification regime, that Tehran is abiding by its terms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The countries that negotiated the deal with Mr. Obama -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- also begged the White House to stick with it. But Mr. Trump demonstrated once again that he can't abide his predecessor's accomplishments, that he will not be persuaded by facts and that he places little or no value on the idea that honoring national commitments safeguards confidence in America's word. Why would North Korea negotiate with the United States over its nuclear stockpile when it sees how little store the Trump administration sets by diplomatic accords?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's European allies, outraged by Mr. Trump's decision, have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, which includes encouraging European companies to invest in Iran. (Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering a visit to Tehran, which would be a first for a French president since the 1970s.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, because of its anti-Israel bias, is not likely to be nearly as consequential as his opposition to the Iran deal, although it extends his war on international obligations. And his threat to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is still just a threat, albeit an ominous one.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most economists agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> contributed to some job losses in manufacturing but that abandoning it would hurt the economy over all. Even American industries that brought some production back within the borders would probably use fewer workers than in the past, because of automation. Further, other sectors of the economy, like agriculture and services, would stand to lose business if Canada and Mexico imposed higher tariffs on American imports. Whatever gains the United States might enjoy by torpedoing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are unlikely to be enough to justify alienating two of its most important allies and neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If revoked or substantially renegotiated, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would join an already sizable list of agreements on which Mr. Trump has reneged, including the Paris accord on climate change and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. He has meanwhile raised doubts in various speeches and offhand remarks about his commitment to the United Nations and to NATO. And to what end? The stock answer is that he is seeking to placate and energize his \"base\" -- the voters troubled by economic decline -- by building a wall not just against immigrants but against economic competition and foreign entanglements, thereby making their lives and livelihoods more secure. In an economically interdependent world, that is a false promise.

{"id": "1977493381.xml", "text": "<h2>REVIEW --- Mr. Trump's Traffic Problem --- The president is right to stress reciprocity in trade; His mistake is to focus on the imbalances between countries rather than on the rules of market access</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Donald Trump has often been accused of being a protectionist. During the election campaign, he called for high tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and in his inaugural address he said that, when it comes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, \"protection will lead to great strength and prosperity.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the president doesn't consider himself a protectionist. \"I'm absolutely a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r. I'm for open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but I also want smart <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" he recently said. His aim is to replace existing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals, which he considers \"a disaster\" and \"one-sided,\" and adopt a new approach. As he told leaders in the Asia Pacific region at a November summit, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> arrangements should be based on \"fairness and reciprocity.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In setting out this principle, Mr. Trump joins a long line of American presidents who have endorsed fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and reciprocity. But there is a problem with how he frames the issue. Mr. Trump wants to achieve reciprocity not in the rules of the game but in a particular outcome: the balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with individual countries. This is no way for the U.S. -- and the world -- to prosper.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists since Adam Smith have argued that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance, particularly any bilateral surplus or deficit, is not the right measure of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s benefits. A <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit may sound alarming, but it has no significance by itself. What does matter is reciprocity in market access, and this is best achieved in regional and multilateral agreements. By abandoning or undermining these deals, the Trump administration has abdicated U.S. leadership. Even bilateral agreements, which Mr. Trump touts, may now be out of reach, because other countries are justifiably reluctant to negotiate about outcomes rather than rules.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>America's desire for reciprocity in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> goes back to the country's quest for independence. Among the many grievances cited in the Declaration of Independence was the complaint that Britain was \"cutting off our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with all parts of the world\" through its mercantilist regulations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When the U.S. achieved its independence, the country was hopeful that its new standing would usher in an era of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. But Britain took a hard line, arguing that the U.S. could not leave the British Empire politically and yet remain a part of it economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1793, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson issued a \"Report on Commercial Restrictions\" that extolled the idea of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but documented the numerous barriers placed on American goods and ships in foreign markets. He proposed achieving reciprocity through a policy of retaliation: \"Where a nation imposed high duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it may be proper for us to do the same by theirs.\" But the U.S. was too minor an economic power to make good on such threats and, rather than risk a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war, opted instead for an imperfect agreement with Britain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most of the next century, the U.S. abandoned the quest for reciprocity. Congress set high tariff rates without regard to the rules set by other countries. By the 1890s, however, new developments prompted some to reconsider the wisdom of protectionism. The U.S. had become a net exporter of manufactured goods, and discriminatory <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies abroad were impeding access to foreign markets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The prime mover behind a renewed interest in reciprocity was President William McKinley. Speaking at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo on Sept. 5, 1901, he declared that economic \"isolation is no longer possible or desirable.\" \"The period of exclusiveness is past,\" he said. \"Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times, measures of retaliation are not.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We will never know if President McKinley could have been successful in concluding such treaties because, just a day after delivering this address, he was shot and killed by an assassin. His successor, Theodore Roosevelt, was a passionate progressive reformer in many areas but not when it came to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Having repeatedly stated that the tariff \"should be decided solely on grounds of expediency,\" he found it expedient to do nothing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The last gasp of protectionism came with the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff increase in 1930. Focused solely on the interests of select domestic producers, Congress gave little heed to foreign protests that came pouring in, let alone to the concerns of U.S. exporters or consumers. Congress ignored warnings of possible foreign retaliation, and the international backlash dealt a swift and devastating blow to American exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shift toward reciprocity finally came with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his appointment of Cordell Hull as Secretary of State. Hull believed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> friction between countries bred political friction and conflict, such as World War I. He helped to convince Congress to pass the Reciprocal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreements Act of 1934, which gave the president the authority to reduce tariffs in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements with other countries. His main goal was to eliminate foreign discrimination against U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hull's efforts eventually led, after World War II, to the General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span>, the cornerstone of which was reciprocity among members in the rules of the game. While the GATT didn't equalize tariff treatment of goods in all markets, it began to chip away at the discriminatory policies targeted at American exporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. also promoted the formation of the European Economic Community, a precursor of the European Union, in order to strengthen the continent's economies and to make them a more effective bulwark against communism. The EEC removed taxes on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between members and set a common external tariff. The U.S. worried that this tariff, and the preference for intra-European <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, would be prejudicial to American commerce, so Washington initiated negotiations to reduce the new barriers, resulting in revisions to GATT in 1967.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. took the lead again a few decades later in pushing other countries to reduce their tariff walls and subsidies, achieving yet another updating of GATT in 1993. This round of changes established the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization to protect intellectual property rights and to settle disputes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pattern across these historical episodes is clear: The U.S. has been active in promoting free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> when it begins to face discrimination against its commerce abroad. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> negotiations have been a tool for safeguarding American interests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Enter now Donald Trump. Much of what the administration is doing on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is not new. To the extent that it has identified specific policies or practices that violate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rules, addressing them is in the tradition of past presidents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One place, for example, where the administration is on firm ground in complaining about foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies is China. China's blatantly mercantilist \"Made in China 2025\" policy, involving local content requirements and the elimination of foreign suppliers, is the antithesis of an open market economy. But thus far, the administration has given China a pass, with the president saying that he \"doesn't blame\" China for its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is new and unusual is the administration's focus on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with individual countries. We do in fact have a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico, for instance, but the rules of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> still hold: Mexico does not impose any duties on U.S. goods just as we do not impose any duties on Mexican goods. The same would have been true under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which the Trump administration withdrew U.S. support.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The focus on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations is misguided. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is not like a ledger, where imports are the cost and exports are the benefit, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses and deficits do not indicate that one country is \"winning\" and the other \"losing.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit is driven by macroeconomic factors, not by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers or <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The U.S. faced a battery of high <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in the 1950s, when its own market was largely open, and yet it ran <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit fell sharply in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, even though neither the U.S. nor other countries significantly changed their policies regarding imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Just last week, the Commerce Department reported that the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit had widened slightly. This is because the economy is doing well and the unemployment rate has fallen to almost 4%. We should not wish for another economic slowdown to put a further dent in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In some circumstances, it may make sense to care about the overall balance of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. If the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit is viewed as a problem, the solution is for the U.S. to save more and spend less, like countries with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surpluses, such as China, Germany and Japan. One component of America's poor savings record is the federal budget deficit: When it grows as a share of GDP (due to a decline in revenues or an increase in expenditures), it contributes to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it makes no sense to care about balancing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bilaterally with individual countries. A household may care about whether its overall spending exceeds its income, but it doesn't care about balancing each component in its budget. Everyone runs a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with his or her employer. Everyone runs a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with the grocery store, except for the people who work there. It is nonsensical to balance your checkbook bilaterally; just try doing that with Amazon or Costco.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem with negotiating about outcomes rather than rules, focusing on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance rather than on market access, is that it can lead to managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. That happened in the 1980s, when the U.S. was worried about the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan. Managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is the opposite of the goal of establishing freer and fairer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> around the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump has complained about supposedly unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals with Japan, Mexico and Canada without ever really saying what they have done wrong -- aside from the imbalance in our bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with them. With Canada, the U.S. does indeed have a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit in goods, but it has an even larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus in services. Is this \"very unfair\" to Canada? Are we \"taking advantage\" of our longtime ally? What would Mr. Trump say if Canada said that we are obligated to intervene to reduce our surplus?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fixation on outcomes rather than on rules has distorted the U.S. negotiating position. The Trump administration's aggressive \"win-lose\" rhetoric not only puts other countries on the defensive but also baffles them, because the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance is not something that governments directly control. Emphasizing deficits and surpluses has made our trading partners less willing to negotiate and to make concessions on issues of market access. And Mr. Trump's precipitous decision to pull out of the TPP and his threats to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> mean that the U.S. is now viewed as an unreliable partner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration has even criticized Mexico and Canada's other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross complains that cars assembled in Mexico receive better treatment in the EU than those produced in the U.S. The reason is simple: Mexico has a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU, and the U.S. does not. Canada also just recently concluded a comprehensive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU. Both countries now have a leg up over the U.S. in exporting to the EU. The remedy is not to berate the EU for treating the U.S. unfairly but to conclude a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the EU as other countries have.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trump administration promised instead to conclude many bilateral agreements in Asia. But after seeing how the U.S. has treated its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> trading partners, other countries have not been eager to sign up for talks. Japan has already demurred, even though just last week Tokyo was able to reach a major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the EU. The administration professes to want bilateral agreements, but it will not get them if other countries are reluctant to negotiate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the rest of the world will move on and continue to reach <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements that exclude the U.S. The 11 nations of the TPP have already gone ahead to conclude the agreement without the U.S. That will subject U.S. exporters to discrimination in other markets. Japanese cars will receive tariff concessions in Vietnam, Australian beef will be treated better than American beef in Japan, and so forth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And therein, perhaps, lies the silver lining. The more the U.S. stands apart from these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, the more U.S. exporters will face discrimination in foreign markets. President Trump or his successor will eventually have to play catch up to restore the equal access that American businesses will demand.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Irwin is the John French Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College.

{"id": "1993296217.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump Manages to Unify My Country</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The undefended border between the U.S. and Canada is porous. People pass freely, but so do infectious agents and syndromes. I've seen many in my time, mostly during Republican administrations. Few match the power or breadth of the Canadianized strain of Trump derangement syndrome. Whatever Mr. Trump does, Canadians are against it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Take the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Back in the early 1990s, Canadian unions, academics and \"celebrities,\" as well as Canada's Liberal and New Democratic Parties, passionately argued against <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It would destroy us, they said. We would lose our sovereignty. We would lose our social programs. We would become the 51st state!</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now President Trump has called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into question, and many former detractors are suddenly defending the deal. The dubious have become believers. True, some of this is because time has shown <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to be good for Canada, but most of it is reflexive. Canadian liberals are defending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> because Mr. Trump is against it. The more he hates it, the more they like it. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government approached the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> negotiations as if it were dealing with Saudi Arabia or North Korea, making a show of bringing issues like gender equality and the environment to the table.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Actually, Mr. Trump is right about supply management and Canada's dairy industry. Getting rid of our 270% tariff on imported dairy goods would be a positive development for Canadian consumers tired of paying $12 for a wee bit of cheese.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But try telling someone struggling with Trump derangement syndrome that the current American president could be right about anything. Try pointing out to a Canadian who binges on Netflix that the programs he loves come courtesy of an American company.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Or try pointing out that every sufferer of Canadian TDS watches far more American cinema and television than the homegrown variety. Most probably own an Apple product or three. Painful as it is to admit, Canadians are actually quite fond of American stuff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Odd, then, that another mutation of TDS causes some self-righteous Canadians to refuse to set foot in the U.S. for as long as Mr. Trump is president. I know people who, recently returned from living in China, proudly promise never to visit \"Trump's America.\" I can't keep up with the number of friends, relatives and colleagues who have chosen to go to Cuba this winter rather than their usual Florida or South Carolina, giving the occupant of the White House as their reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Evidently vacationing in an island prison with no civil liberties is fine but a getaway to the land of the free is not.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one cure for TDS, apparently, is extreme cold. After about three weeks of below-zero weather here in Toronto, a TDS carrier I know managed to shed his principles when the opportunity of an inexpensive week in a sunny Southern state appeared. Note to Mr. Trump: A few more weeks of winter and Canada might give you what you want on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ms. Adamson is a Canadian writer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Rondi Adamson</p>\n"}
{"id": "2041507022.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump is proving to be the most predictable of presidents</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With North Korea and other challenges, President Trump can succeed where others have failed, we are told, because he is so unpredictable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, he is proving to be the most predictable of presidents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is predictable because he makes decisions based on instincts and biases, many acquired decades ago. Advisers can delay but not dislodge him from his ruts. He is proving impervious to fact, argument or new learning of any kind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since his prejudices are well-known, his decisions should not surprise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What are these predispositions? Allied nations, and especially Japan, play the United States for a chump. Dictators are strong and decisive and therefore to be admired. Immigrants and people of color are suspect. Wealthy people usually know best, while intellectuals are not to be trusted. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> deficits are the ultimate sign of national weakness, and manufacturing is the linchpin of any economy. Anything Barack Obama did should be undone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That canon of gut feelings can explain most of what Trump has done \u2014 and predict what he will do.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He is most predictable when his biases push in the same direction, as with the Paris climate accord. It was a multilateral agreement, so probably other nations were taking advantage of the United States. Scientists believed it was important. Obama considered it a signal achievement. In Trump's world, the treaty did not have a chance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fact that it did not actually bind the United States to take any actions that Trump would not have wanted to take was not in dispute. The argument that pulling out would leave the United States isolated, dealing a major blow to U.S. leadership, was irrefutable. But the facts and arguments ran counter to Trump's preconceived notions, and so were irrelevant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reality-based arguments against withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord were, if anything, even stronger. For a time, the president's senior advisers and his counterparts in Europe, wielding those arguments, managed to postpone the inevitable. After all, Iran was honoring the deal; it was working.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But staying in only made Trump grumpy, because again his preconceptions pushed the opposite way: It was a multilateral treaty; Obama took pride in it. Now the advisers who pushed against the inevitable are mostly gone, and Trump has pulled the United States out of the accord.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His prejudices in various combinations also can explain: A travel ban aimed at Muslims, though data showed no connection between terrorism in the United States and the countries targeted by the ban. A tax bill primarily benefiting businesses and the very rich, though Trump had campaigned on a promise to help the left-behind. A determination to destroy Obamacare, though it was helping many of those same left-behind voters. Abandonment of the mostly Hispanic \"dreamers,\" despite grand promises to help them, while pining for more immigrants from Norway.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many people were surprised that Trump pivoted toward talks with North Korea after months of insulting \"little rocket man\" Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, though, in keeping with his predilection for strongmen, he seems to admire Kim \u2014 that \"pretty smart cookie\" \u2014 more than he does South Korea's elected leader. Since Obama largely ignored North Korea, under the label of \"strategic patience,\" striking a deal would fit Trump's inclination to be Obama's opposite in all things. Brushing aside the interests of our Japanese allies, if that's what a deal requires, also would mesh with his predilections.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Admittedly, this framework can't predict every decision. Because Trump refuses to release his tax returns or much information about his still-active enterprises, we can't know whether or how much business interests may motivate his official decisions and override his prejudices.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In addition, his gut feelings sometimes work at cross-purposes. He hates</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>because it's a treaty, because he thinks it hurts U.S. manufacturers, because he has always hated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; on the other hand, a lot of wealthy American business and agricultural executives would be hurt if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> blew up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And even if Trump's thinking is not much influenced by evidence or experience, he is fenced in by reality in other ways; the courts and Congress and the states get a say, and like most politicians, he wants to be popular, admired and, presumably, reelected. So, for example, his gut instincts (and maybe his business interests, too) push him to be friends with Vladi\u00admir Putin, but that has yet to happen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, for a man who ran for office saying, \"We have to be unpredictable,\" Trump is proving not so hard to read. Look at whatever he has believed since the 1980s; ignore any evidence that has emerged since; and you can make a fairly educated guess where he will end up.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>fredhiatt@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "2063283624.xml", "text": "<h2>Trump, a new Mexican leader and the fate of NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A seismic jolt just swept over our neighbor to the south. Mexicans elected as their next president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a longtime leftist who has risen to power buoyed by much the same anger with the status quo that put Donald Trump in the White House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lopez Obrador\u2019s \u201cMexico first\u201d message to voters resonated deeply with a country fed up with previous administrations seen as elitist, corrupt and indifferent to the plight of the impoverished. Time will tell whether he can deliver on the lofty promises he\u2019s made, including a pledge to end all corruption, which he claims will generate billions of dollars that he will use to uplift the poor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His rhetoric about the U.S. \u2014 he would like to scale back Mexican imports of U.S. farm goods and promised to ensure his country\u2019s oil never falls \u201cback into the hands of foreigners\u201d \u2014 suggests potential for combative ties with the U.S. But Mexico\u2019s economy has seen anemic growth, and frosty relations with Washington would only worsen his country\u2019s economic doldrums.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Instead, Lopez Obrador would be smart to quickly find common ground with Trump, and collaborating on a reworked North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is the place to start. What tack Lopez Obrador will take on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> isn\u2019t known yet. Historically, he has been critical of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact, though during the campaign he and his advisers talked of preserving it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That\u2019s a good sign. Economic growth is a lot easier to forge with free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Protectionism and tariffs shrink markets, and that\u2019s bad for both sides of the border. Illinois has particularly benefited from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In 1993, before the pact kicked in, the state exported less than $6.4 billion in goods to Canada and Mexico. By 2015, Illinois exports to those countries reached $26 billion, amounting to 41 percent of the state\u2019s total export output.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump, however, appears to be digging in for a fight. On Sunday, he said he wasn\u2019t happy with the shape of a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal that his team has been working on, and would rather wait until after the midterm elections in November before signing any agreement. \u201c<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, I could sign it tomorrow, but I\u2019m not happy with it. I want to make it more fair, OK?\u201d Trump told Fox News. Meanwhile, Canada on Sunday began imposing tariffs on American steel, aluminum, ketchup and beef in retaliation for Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum. As the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> battles burgeon, more American companies and farmers feel the bite.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe Lopez Obrador can talk sense into Trump when they sit down for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> talks. Imagine if he\u2019s successful \u2014 a leader who\u2019s been likened to the latest Latin American iteration of the late Venezuelan leftist Hugo Chavez getting an American president to take the sensible path toward a reworking of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We accept that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which has been around since the mid-1990s, is due for an update. The key is to update without creating wreckage. It\u2019s not just the Mexican and Canadian economies that are at stake. So is America\u2019s, the state of Illinois\u2019 export-oriented economy included.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2095117004.xml", "text": "<h2>ANALYSIS; NAFTA with no Canada? Is Trump bluffing?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Canada returned to the bargaining table Tuesday to renegotiate the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, hanging over the talks was President Trump's ominous vow: If Ottawa doesn't bend to U.S. demands, he'll lock up a pact with Mexico alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether Trump meant it or not, it won't be that easy. More likely his threat is a bluff because there are significant -- some say insurmountable -- legal constraints and political hurdles to replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> with one or two bilateral accords.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond the uncertainty of whether Mexico would even sign an agreement without Canada -- Mexican officials gave mixed signals about that -- practically no one thinks cutting out Canada is a good idea economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was designed as a three-way deal to integrate the North American region and create a powerful economic bloc and market. Breaking that up into one or two bilateral deals would create significant disruptions and undercut the supply chains and efficiencies that have been built up over a quarter of a century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has made North America a powerhouse, and the only way we can compete for global markets with Asian and European producers is to maintain and strengthen the entire North American production base,\" said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Council, a business advocacy group.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since Trump announced Monday that his administration had a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada out in the cold, lawyers and congressional leaders have also questioned whether the president has the legal authority to do so.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For one thing, forging a separate bilateral agreement is expected to be accompanied by Trump's termination of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- and it's far from clear that the president has the authority to unilaterally dissolve the pact. Some experts say that power ultimately rests with Congress, which approved the agreement in 1993.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, the existing \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority\" that gives the president more leeway in pushing a revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> through Congress wouldn't apply to a separate two-country pact. That means Trump probably would need another congressional action to sign and submit a U.S.-Mexico agreement for ratification -- and that will almost certainly stir up a huge political fight.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think Congress is going to be a bulwark against the possibility of massive chaos and uncertainty by the Trump administration's move on the chessboard,\" said Claire Reade, a former assistant U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, referring to any effort to break <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> into pieces.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Getting anything through Congress, particularly if Democrats take control of the House in November, will be all that much harder for Trump. Even Republicans don't like abandoning the trilateral agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think there are technical problems with that, and so my hope is that Canada comes on board rather quickly,\" the Republican whip, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters Tuesday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's ultimatum to Canada partly reflected his preference for bilateral deals and his hardball negotiating style. But it was also a recognition that unless Canada agrees to a revamped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in a matter of days, it could result in new challenges and more delays in completing a renegotiated <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's because a new president in Mexico will take office Dec. 1.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Allowing the current Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to sign a deal would provide political cover for the incoming leader, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, since he would not be directly tied to any concessions made to Trump. The U.S. needs to notify Congress of a deal Friday, preferably including Canada, in order to meet a 90-day congressional procedural requirement before the countries can formally sign a deal.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The incoming administration [in Mexico] would like to have the current president basically approve it before he gets into office. But all of them have been consulted,\" Cornyn said. \"And I hope we can get this done. And I hope Canada is on board. Because that would eliminate some of the technical procedural problems.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Tuesday that he saw a three-way agreement coming together this week, which would make the potential bilateral problem moot. But he told CNBC that if there isn't a deal with Canada, \"we'll move forward with Mexico and then we'll reach a separate agreement with Canada.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Others were not optimistic about a quick settlement between the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I think you might have to start the process all over again,\" said a Washington <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of client sensitivities, referring to the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion requirement and 90-day notification requirement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are several thorny unresolved issues between Canada and the United States. Both Canada and Mexico strongly objected to a U.S. proposal for a so-called sunset clause that would automatically dissolve <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> after five years unless all the parties agreed to renew it. In the end, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to allow a revamped <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s term to be extended to 16 years, but every six years the parties could still bring up issues for negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That sunset provision won't fly with Canadian officials, said Eric Miller, president of the consulting firm Rideau Potomac Strategy Group and advisor to the Canadian government on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> affairs. The U.S. and Canada also will be wrangling over Trump's personal oft-cited grievance: Canada's 300% tariff on milk imports and overall protected dairy market.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Trying to unwind that in a week is very, very difficult,\" he said. Like American sugar and agricultural sectors, he said, \"dairy farmers are a very powerful lobby\" in Canada. And Trump, who is not popular in Canada, has not made it easy for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to cave in without risking significant political costs with his domestic constituents.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Miller, who is monitoring the talks, said Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, arrived in Washington with her negotiating team, and they were meeting with U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer and others into late Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the moment, analysts said Mexico was holding the trilateral talks together, but it's unclear what it will do if the U.S. and Canada can't come to terms fairly quickly. Mexican officials may have a hard time selling a U.S.-Mexico-only deal to a public that will be skeptical about an agreement that Canada has balked at.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Mexicans may have to decide: Are they going to stand with the Canadians or are they going to throw them under the bus?\" said William Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like many other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> experts, Reinsch said it was imperative that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> remain a three-way pact, to preserve the gains and advantages of the large free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone. Reinsch said, for example, that car companies, which account for a big chunk of the three-way <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, have supply chains that cross both borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the preliminary deal between the U.S. and Mexico included some notable changes aimed at increasing use of suppliers in North America and giving producers in the region an edge over rivals in Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Reinsch said that if the U.S. has separate rules for Canada and Mexico, \"it will force [companies] to revise their supply chains to conform to two conflicting standards.\" And that, \"at a minimum will cost them time and money,\" he said. \"And it will lead to a more expensive product and less competitive industry.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>--</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>don.lee@latimes.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n"}

I think it's an elegant name,\" he said in a phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \"I think <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has a lot of bad connotations for the United States, because it was a rip-off.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But by whatever label, any revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement will look a lot like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The Trump administration contends that it made breakthroughs in protecting \"intellectual property\" (patents, copyrights, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> secrets) and in opening markets for digital technology. Time will tell whether these claims amount to much. Otherwise, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s major accomplishment \u2014 eliminating most tariffs among the three countries \u2014 would remain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The one area where the new agreement is starkly more protectionist involves cars and trucks. All along, Trump has aimed to shift more production from low-wage countries to the high-wage United States. He would achieve this goal by imposing a variety of conditions that car manufacturers would have to meet to be exempt from a 2.5 percent tariff.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the local content of these qualifying autos \u2014 required production in North America \u2014 would be raised from the existing level of 62.5 percent to 75 percent. Next, there would be a requirement that between 40 percent and 45 percent of the autos' content would have to come from workers earning at least $16 an hour. This would be a huge boost for many Mexican autoworkers, whose hourly pay averages about $3, reports The Washington Post's Heather Long. By contrast, U.S. autoworkers average more than $22 an hour.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The point, says an administration fact sheet, is to \"support better jobs for United States producers and workers by requiring that a significant portion of vehicle content be made with high-wage labor.\" The content requirements would pressure many auto part suppliers to keep their operations in the United States or to relocate factories that had moved abroad to return, according to the fact sheet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor is this all, says economist Jeffrey J. Schott of the Peterson Institute, a critic of the agreement. \"There are layers and layers of requirements,\" he notes. For example, 70 percent of the steel, aluminum and glass in vehicles must come from North American sources.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the requirements are so complex that many auto companies may decide that complying with them is not worth the trouble, Schott says. Companies might determine that paying the 2.5 percent tariff is the least costly alternative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, that might not be the end of the story. Trump is also considering raising car tariffs as high as 25 percent because the industry is said to be vital to national security. This would, quite probably, result in hefty price increases and dampened production, hurting American consumers, workers and auto companies. In the worst of all possible worlds, everyone loses.</p>\n"}
{"id": "2099304391.xml", "text": "<h2>Detroit vs. Protectionism?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Cars are the big one,\" President Trump told Fox News in July, explaining his evolving theory of easy-to-win <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> wars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether he meant cars are his leverage point to remake the world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> system according to some coherent vision, or simply the means to create a big show, with lots of fake drama and suspense, is an open question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But perhaps not that open: If one thing became clear through 14 campaign debates and two years of the Trump presidency, Mr. Trump does not do policy details. It's all just symbolism to him.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A victory will be declared at the end of the day, of that you can be sure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His underlings, however, are obliged to give text to his impulses, and onlookers are obliged to try to make sense of the result. Let's start with the Mexico deal. It requires that 40% to 45% of a vehicle eligible for no-tariff treatment under the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement be produced by workers making $16 or more an hour. It also requires that 75% (up from 62.5%) of a car's content be produced within the U.S. or Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first rule would shift production of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>-eligible cars from Mexico to the U.S. The second would shift production from third countries (say South Korea, Germany or China) to the U.S. and Mexico. Yet the effect would be small. Only 27% of cars currently made in Mexico would be affected, and auto makers say adjusting won't be hard. Whether this means more U.S. jobs is uncertain. Car makers might prefer just to swallow the existing 2.5% tariff that applies to non-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where those inclined to see method in Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> madness point to a pending Section 232 study by the Commerce Department, meant ludicrously to find that U.S. national security is threatened by auto-related imports, thereby allowing Mr. Trump to impose 25% duties on cars from Europe and Asia and possibly even Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Doing so would thoroughly disrupt global auto markets, driving up prices for U.S. consumers, and only eventually perhaps bring more auto investment to the U.S. A Mercedes or BMW from Germany might jump $10,000 in price; a Chevy Equinox, Dodge Caravan or Toyota RAV4 from Canada might jump $5,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Right now, such an outcome is unthinkable. Congress would hear from dealers and car buyers and throw itself athwart Mr. Trump's plan. Even the unions are ambivalent. In their public utterances, the Big Three -- Ford, GM and Chrysler -- are also opposed and presumably mean it, presumably.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Widely quoted was GM chief Mary Barra's apparently blanket statement on a conference call that \"we are free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs.\" Unfortunately her claim was preamble to a typically vague, noncommittal GM answer to an admirably precise question.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question, by J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, is worth repeating: \"Has there been any scenario planning within GM that suggests that potential other changes to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> could actually shake out positively for you? I know GM management stands for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but it seems to us that certain scenarios, such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> remaining but Section 232 tariffs applying to imported vehicles from outside the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> bloc, that could actually end up being quite positive for you from a pricing or share perspective?\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exactly. Protectionism can be quite profitable for companies that benefit from it, at least until they become fat and lazy and fall behind their overseas competitors in quality and technology.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump, in Trumpian fashion, has lots of balls in the air, and is proceeding chaotically as he did at times in his business. He may yet decide to go for broke. And Detroit, despite its investment in rising markets like China and its attachment to its global supply chains, could be the weak link in any resistance to a Trump impulse to turn the global car market upside-down.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Certainly you wouldn't take to the bank anything that notoriously obfuscatory Detroit auto executives say about the matter right now.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among the blunt truths they are trained not to mention is that they embraced <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in the first place to use Mexico to level the playing field with foreign transplants that built their factories in the south to avoid the United Automobile Workers. Homegrown U.S. auto makers remain bound to the UAW while foreign-born ones in the U.S. enjoy a free labor market. This is a bigger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> distortion than any Mr. Trump is offering. It's also the cause of many other distortions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For instance, the Big Three's also-ran status in sedans is a legacy of John Dingell's \"anti-backsliding rule\" that for decades required them to build money-losing small cars in high-cost UAW factories. The Big Three's continuing dependence on excess pickup profits is a legacy of the 25% tariff on imported pickups that has evolved since the 1960s into Washington's main gift to prop up Detroit despite the many political burdens it must bear.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So keep this history in mind. I wouldn't be 100% confident of Detroit turning up its nose at a big offer of Trump protectionism to solve all the headaches that continue to arise from Washington's 80-plus years of meddling in the car business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Holman W.

{"id": "2115976212.xml", "text": "<h2>U.S. News -- Capital Account: Trade Deal Shows Limits of 'America First'</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is a bitter pill to swallow. It introduces managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> to autos, waters down foreign rights of corporations and normalizes national security as a pretext for tariffs. Many of its improvements, such as on intellectual property and labor rights, were already in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, from which President Trump has withdrawn.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the verdict is different when judged by a different standard -- how the world's trading system survives the most protectionist U.S. administration in memory. The new deal shows the limits to Mr. Trump's \"America First\" agenda and an underlying resilience to the existing order. The reason: The resistance Mr. Trump encountered from Congress, business, his own advisers and U.S. trading partners circumscribed his leverage and may again in the future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the outset, the U.S. held all the cards: Mexico and Canada depended far more on exports to the U.S. than vice versa. Mr. Trump shared none of his predecessors' affection for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. His threats to abandon the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and even the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization weren't hollow. He proved this with unilateral tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement looks a lot like the old one. Mexico's only significant concession was on autos and parts: Rules require more North American production, higher wages and potential tariffs if exports to the U.S. exceed 2.6 million vehicles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet these auto rules may have little practical significance. Jeff Schuster, of consulting firm LMC Automotive, says some lower-priced models assembled in Mexico by Volkswagen, Mazda and other manufacturers may no longer qualify for duty-free entry. Rather than shift production to the U.S., they may simply pay the 2.5% tariff, he says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from expanding capacity in Mexico but won't affect current shipments, since U.S. auto demand has stagnated. Canada also faces an export cap, but it is far above current exports and thus even less likely to bind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once the U.S. had a deal with Mexico, it urged Canada to sign on or be left out. But Canadian negotiators, who have a reputation for intransigence dating back to the original 1988 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with the U.S., didn't capitulate. Canada also had cultivated allies among U.S. governors, senators, congressmen and business groups.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ron Johnson, Republican senator from Wisconsin, says he made the case to Mr. Trump's advisers for a deal including Canada, not just Mexico. He says he told them what \"businesses on the ground were experiencing because of the steel and aluminum tariffs, and what would happen if we weren't able to continue a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone in North America.\" Wisconsin farmers were upset last year when Canada blocked imports of their ultrafiltered milk. Mr. Johnson said Canada's ambassador reached out to Canadian-owned processors in Wisconsin who bought the milk, saving those farmers from lost sales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Had U.S. negotiators proceeded without Canada, there was a real risk that Congress wouldn't ratify an agreement with only Mexico, particularly if Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in November.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>How that risk affected the outcome is unclear. Canada did end up making an important concession by expanding U.S. access to its heavily protected dairy market. The U.S. gave imports more access to its protected peanut-butter and sugar markets. So this is a genuine victory for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that benefits consumers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Canada succeeded in preserving binational panels that can overrule U.S. decisions to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties. That was a notable concession by U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer, who as a private lawyer representing companies seeking protection, had suffered a reversal at the hands of such a panel and long complained that they infringe on U.S. sovereignty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The outcome has important lessons for future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations. Mr. Trump will soon be negotiating with Japan and the EU over steel and autos. Yet his leverage will be constrained by pressure from exporters and businesses in the U.S. that stand to lose from higher costs at home and retaliation abroad, and consequently resistance from Congress. Mr. Trump's threats to upend the WTO are likely to meet even more resistance from Congress than his threats to scrap <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sometime next year Mr. Trump will have to get Congress to approve the USMCA.

If the Democrats (thank you, I appreciate your patience) ignore these subjects, they risk losing next week and in 2020.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president got my attention in September when the subject of new tariffs on China arose - tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. Certain Apple products that might have been affected were ultimately excluded after the company objected. Still, Trump had told Apple, with a characteristic snarl on Twitter, \"Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Apple obviously would regard the demand as a punitive one, likely to reduce the profits of a trillion-dollar company that depends on the sweat of poorly paid Chinese labor and the connivance of Chinese commissars whose oppressive policies are well-known and widely publicized. Yet Trump's point is a fair one: Why not make Apple products here? Anyone driving the side roads of America sees towns put out of work because manufacturing went elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of Trump's winning pitches as a candidate called attention to these towns, and he was cheered as he gave speeches in them, promising to revitalize them by renegotiating the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Having just spent two years traveling in Mexico, I agree that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was deeply flawed, though not in ways that Trump cares about.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Companies that moved their manufacturing to Mexico are prospering, but their workers there barely make ends meet. The exploitation of labor in the maquiladoras in border towns is a disgrace - the visible obscenity of American factories a few hundred yards over the border at, say, Mexicali or Ciudad Juarez or Reynosa, merely to allow these companies to pay workers $8.50 a day, making everything from airplane components to automobile seat belts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's recent renegotiation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>won't do much to change things, which makes it all the more important for Democratic candidates to understand the deal's inequities, the fundamental one being that it put American workers out of jobs while exploiting Mexican workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Immigration policy is flawed too, and the subject of migration misunderstood. No, the answer is not building the Murus Hadrianus Trumpus at the border, but the problem is far greater than the stereotype of Mexicans swimming across the Rio Grande.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, Mexican immigration has plunged in recent years, but there has been a surge in undocumented migrants from Central America, as with the thousands of Hondurans making their way north through Mexico en masse toward the United States over the past several days. Add to these unfortunates the many so-called special-interest aliens</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>, Chinese who pay a small fortune to sneak through tunnels into California, or the undocumented Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Syrians, Iraqis, Nigerians and Afghans sitting in detention centers. The creators of so-called sanctuary cities who embrace migrants might rethink their role if they considered harboring the Chinese migrant who paid $70,000 to be guided by a cartel member under the border through a tunnel to a safe house in Calexico or San Ysidro.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's hostility to immigration and his appeal to old-fashioned Americana is seen as nativist and sometimes racist. This is a delicate subject, but the question of roots has been a theme in elections in Italy, Austria, Germany, France and Britain, and to say it is irrelevant is a mistake. Anyone who came of age in 1950s America has witnessed a doubling of the U.S. population and an enormous cultural shift. Its upside is diversity, of course; its downside is an erosion of historical memory, and culture shock.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yes, it's a pity that young immigrants, and plenty of young people generally, have never heard of Elvis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins or Annette Funicello. It's of greater concern to me that the names Emmett Till and Rosa Parks are so seldom invoked; that there is so little awareness of America's tradition of dissent, or of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s hope to live in a nation where people \"will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To write off Trump's message, or to see his voters as racist and deplorable, is to miss the point. It is not that the Democrats' elite are geriatrics, though they certainly are; it is that they are too entrenched, too tone deaf and out of touch in myriad ways. The Clintons need to retire to discover the ambiguous pleasures of obscurity that the rest of us already know. Barack Obama is as eloquent as ever, and inspirational, but he needs to understand the dismay many of us feel when seeing him and his fellow Democrats taking money from big companies that outsource work and exploit foreign workers, all the while sucking up to celebrities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A blue wave is predicted for the midterms. I'm not convinced of it. Trump proved most polls wrong for a reason. In Britain, a shy Tory is someone who will not reveal his or her intended vote to a pollster. There are many loud Trumpers, but there are shy Trumpers, too. So I distrust polls more than ever, especially as - after Trump won, and voters became more vocal - I discovered that many in my large and lovable and liberal-minded family, and maybe yours too, revealed themselves as shy Trumpers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Paul Theroux is the author, most recently, of \"Figures in a Landscape: People and Places.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: ;Paul Theroux</p>\n"}

Bush was president</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>for just four years, his economic legacy on taxes, banking and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> reverberate today.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush owed his election in 1988 in part to the low inflation and solid growth during the administration of Ronald Reagan, whom Mr. Bush served as vice president. Yet imbalances that took root under Mr. Reagan would haunt his successor's presidency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One imbalance was the budget deficit. In his losing campaign for the presidential nomination in 1980, Mr. Bush famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply-side tax cuts as \"voodoo economics.\" Yet as vice president he faithfully defended those tax cuts and in his 1988 campaign declared, \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>More</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* George H.W. Bush to Lie in State in the Capitol Rotunda</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Trump Declares Day of Mourning for Bush; NYSE and Nasdaq Say They Will Close</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* America's Guiding Hand Through the Cold War's End</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The clock was ticking, though. The tax cuts had bequeathed persistent deficits and Congress had passed laws in 1985 and 1987 to trigger across-the-board spending cuts if deficits weren't addressed. To avert those provisions, Democrats, who controlled Congress, insisted that spending cuts be accompanied by tax increases. Mr. Bush acquiesced and broke his pledge in 1990.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have ever since blamed that decision both for the recession that began that year and Mr. Bush's defeat in 1992. Reality is more complicated. The recession was mild, ending in March 1991, long before Mr. Bush would face the voters again. But it didn't feel that way because unemployment continued to rise into 1992. Such jobless recoveries were unheard of at the time but have since become commonplace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The jobless recovery can be traced to a second imbalance Mr. Bush inherited: a banking system, including thousands of savings and loan institutions, unable to lend because of bad real-estate loans attributable to lax oversight and haphazard deregulation. Mr. Bush's Treasury officials were preoccupied with cleaning up that mess and implementing sounder regulations. One of them, Jerome Powell, would take those lessons with him to the Federal Reserve where, as chairman, he remains acutely sensitive to how financial imbalances can threaten growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite his foreign policy triumphs--driving Iraq out of Kuwait and smoothing the fallout from the end of the Cold War--Mr. Bush lost to Bill Clinton and his relentless focus on the economy. Another factor: a loss of support to third-party candidate Ross Perot. Mr. Perot was motivated in part by opposition to another Bush decision: negotiation of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Mexico and Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a watershed in globalization. It was quantitatively less important than the integration of billions of workers from Eastern Europe and China into the global economy, the creation of the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 1994, and advances in technology. But as the first free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact between rich and poor countries, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> came to symbolize the collision of interests between blue collar workers on one hand and consumers, corporations, and geostrategic cooperation on the other. Opposition to it was a centerpiece of President Trump's campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush left a substantive economic legacy: his record on deficit reduction, bank repair and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization paved the way for the long expansion of the 1990s, budget surpluses and a global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> boom. The political consequences are much more contentious.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Mr. Bush signed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it was up to President Bill Clinton whether to seek its ratification. His decision to do so marked a pivot by Democratic presidents and presidential candidates toward an embrace of globalization and away from the party's blue-collar base. Contemplating how rust-belt workers flocked to Mr. Trump's stridently nationalist message in 2016, many Democrats now regret that pivot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Republicans, Mr. Bush's 1992 loss has become a cautionary tale; inflexible opposition to higher taxes is now integral to the party's identity. No Republican president since has raised taxes. It is one of the few things on which Mr. Trump and his party's establishment agree.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These political pressures are coming to a boil. There are no longer enough free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs in either party to push globalization forward; the question is whether there are enough to keep it from sliding backward. Mr. Trump has renegotiated a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> yet this past weekend promised to exit from the old agreement even if the new one isn't ratified.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tax cut passed by Republicans and signed by Mr. Trump has caused the budget deficit to balloon when a strong economy should be shrinking it, setting up battles over whose programs will be cut and whose taxes will be raised for years to come. Though a product of the divisive climate that prevails today, these tensions all have roots in decisions George H.W. Bush took nearly three decades ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Write to Greg Ip at  greg.ip@wsj.com</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}

Beyond China, the Trump administration is expected to advance by February a plan for new tariffs on the Japanese and European auto industries. And in an important political test for the president, the Trump administration will have to work with the newly elected Democratic majority in the House to gain congressional approval of the proposed new North American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In each case the outcome will shape the Trump <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> legacy -- and the bottom line of practically any company with a significant international supply chain.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump on Saturday agreed not to raise tariffs on $200 billion a year of imports from China to 25% from 10% in January, part of a truce in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict with China. Yet those levies could be back on the table as early as March, depending on the outcome of talks. And even the lower tariffs are already affecting supply chains.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Business lobbyists say the administration would face a political backlash from consumers if it adds hundreds of billions of dollars more of imports from China to its tariffs list</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it isn't entirely clear how far Mr. Trump and his team will go with their threats to increase or impose new tariffs, or to overhaul existing U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. The administration, which says its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies are aimed at helping workers in the manufacturing industries, has shown a willingness to use the threat of tariffs to cut deals such as the proposed new North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, which in reality promises to have only a slight or moderate effect on industries. Mr. Trump himself has credited the threat of tariffs with bringing trading partners to the negotiating table.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Tough talk, backed up by tough action, has resulted in landmark restructuring\" of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other agreements, says White House <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> adviser Peter Navarro. In a recent speech, Mr. Navarro described <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-enforcement cases that end in tariffs on imports as a \"power that was lying dormant for decades.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within Mr. Trump's administration, however, there are differences of opinion between <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hawks like Mr. Navarro and more traditional, business-friendly Republican officials. Last month, Mr. Navarro lashed out at Wall Street for seeking to press its version of a deal to de-escalate the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> conflict with China. Days later, Lawrence Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Mr. Navarro wasn't speaking for the president.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Uncertainty about how hard the White House will push on tariffs and sweeping new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements has complicated decisions for business leaders. Many businesses are complaining already about tariffs on imports. Many U.S. companies are paying more for steel and aluminum due to tariffs imposed by President Trump, for example, and they could face additional hurdles if the U.S. puts more duties in place, or if trading partners use tariffs to retaliate against U.S. exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A potential worst-case scenario for many companies could see the Trump administration extending U.S. tariffs to all imports from China, as well as imposing auto tariffs of 25% on light cars and parts form outside North America, all in addition to the continuation of current steel and aluminum duties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some U.S. companies, to be sure, are benefiting from new tariffs. Mr. Trump has defended the metals tariffs as helping steel and aluminum producers and their workers. The United Steelworkers won pay increases for its workers in November.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. auto industry, meanwhile, is less sanguine about White House proposals for tariffs on imports. Auto makers, parts suppliers and dealers have expressed fears that the Trump administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy will backfire and lead to higher prices and lost jobs as producers such as General Motors Co. look to avoid tariffs and build more production in growing car markets in Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The White House is using its threat of possible tariffs on auto and auto-parts imports in negotiations it has launched with the EU and Japan. Some officials, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have expressed impatience with a lack of concessions from the EU in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, and President Trump criticized France following a visit with President Emmanuel Macron last month.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Formal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks with the EU and Japan can't begin before January, only weeks before the February deadline for Mr. Ross to release a report on possible auto tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By around the middle of next year, the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal -- known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, or USMCA -- is expected to go to the Senate and House of Representatives for approval. Under 2015 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> legislation, both chambers must take up the agreement quickly, barring extraordinary steps leadership could take to derail a vote. Congressional aides say they expect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and the new House speaker to work toward a deal on legislation to implement the new pact, especially since Mr. Trump has signaled he'll withdraw from the old <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Labor unions have indicated they could lobby for the agreement if the Trump administration shores up enforcement mechanisms for higher labor standards in Mexico. If labor does support the agreement, that could pave the way for ratification by discouraging attempts by Democratic leaders to deprive Mr. Trump of a major policy victory.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Predictions are risky, but a first look suggests at a minimum that many of the incoming Democrats will be open-minded on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and that it would be a mistake to start planning the funeral\" for the USMCA, says Bill Reinsch, a former congressional aide to both parties and current senior <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Mauldin is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Washington.

One, between the U.S. and its traditional, democratic trading partners, looks a lot like the system that has prevailed since the 1980s: free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with a smattering of quotas and tariffs like those Ronald Reagan once deployed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reflects an emerging rivalry between the U.S. and China carrying echoes of the Cold War. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, investment and technology, the U.S. is moving to undo some of the integration that followed China's accession to the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization in 2001.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There are two big questions hanging over this realignment. The first is deciding how far the U.S. is prepared to decouple from China. The U.S. has given China until March 1 to avoid higher tariffs by addressing complaints it discriminates against foreign companies and steals their technology. Mr. Trump is counting on a deal that avoids a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war. But many in his administration and Congress don't trust China to make the necessary concessions and would likely advocate a sharper break.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second question is whether the U.S. can persuade allies to join a united front to contain China. Other countries don't relish the choice. Their economic ties to China are far greater than they ever were to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor are the ideological choices as clear cut. China isn't waging an ideological struggle against the West as the Soviets did, and Mr. Trump, while enacting policies reminiscent of President Reagan, lacks his commitment to alliances and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Two years ago, it was easy to predict a grimmer fate for the global trading system. Mr. Trump campaigned as a protectionist willing to tear up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and raise tariffs to shrink the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit and bring back factory jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In his first week he withdrew from the unratified 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. He prepared to pull out of the U.S.-Korea Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (Korus) and the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Earlier this year he imposed steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, using a little-used national security law, and threatened the same for autos.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, Korus and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> have been replaced by updated pacts (one not yet ratified) that look much like the originals. South Korea accepted quotas on steel. Mexico and Canada agreed to higher wages, North American content rules and auto quotas.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These represent a step back from free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> toward managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, but they will have little practical effect. The limits on how many cars Mexico and Canada can ship duty-free to the U.S. for example, exceed current shipments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit that incenses Mr. Trump has grown during his presidency as the U.S. sucks in imports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Douglas Irwin, an economist and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> historian at Dartmouth College, calls these results the \"status quo with Trumpian tweaks: a little more managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> sprinkled about for favored industries. It's not good, but it's not the destruction of the system.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump's actions so far affect only 12% of U.S. imports, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In 1984, 21% of imports were covered by similar restraints, many imposed by Mr. Reagan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is testament to something Mr. Irwin has identified in two centuries of U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy: Both protectionism and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> breed powerful constituencies invested in the status quo. Mr. Trump's protectionist instincts go only so far when Congress, business and the national security establishment don't share them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet the status quo with China is crumbling. Businesses have grown disillusioned with China's restrictions on their activities, forced technology transfer and intellectual-property theft. Legislators in both parties are alarmed at increased military assertiveness and domestic repression under President Xi Jinping.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sen. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) personifies these broader forces reshaping the U.S. approach to the world. Mr. Sullivan has followed the rise of China for decades -- as a Marine sent to the Taiwan Strait in 1996; as an official in George W. Bush's National Security Council and State Department; and as Alaska's commissioner of natural resources.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Mr. Xi visited the U.S. in 2015, Mr. Sullivan urged his colleagues to pay more attention to China's rise. He quoted the political scientist Graham Allison: \"War between the U.S. and China is more likely than recognized at the moment.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last spring, Mr. Sullivan went to China and met officials including Vice President Wang Qishan. They seemed to think tensions with the U.S. will fade after Mr. Trump, Mr. Sullivan recalled. \"I just said, 'You are completely misreading this.'\" The mistrust, he told them, is bipartisan, and will outlast Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While delivering one message to China, Mr. Sullivan gave a different one to the administration and its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators: Don't alienate allies needed to take on China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Modernize the agreements but stay within the agreements,\" he says he counseled them. \"Then we have to turn to the really big geostrategic challenge facing our country and that's China.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>His was one voice among many urging Mr. Trump to single out China for pressure. Presidents Obama and George W. Bush sought to change China's behavior through dialogue and engagement. Last year, in its National Security Strategy, the Trump administration declared engagement a failure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration regards economic policy and national security as inseparable when it comes to Beijing, because China's acquisition of Western technology both strengthens China militarily and weakens the U.S. economically.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We don't like it when our allies steal our ideas either, but it's a much less dangerous situation,\" said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute whose views align with the administration's more hawkish officials. \"We're not worried about the war-fighting capability of Japan and Korea because they're our friends.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration has yet to publicly explain its goals. In 1946, at the start of the Cold War, diplomat George Kennan made the case for containing the Soviet Union in his famous \"long telegram.\" The Trump administration hasn't done anything comparable for China. One reason might be that administration officials are divided. Mr. Trump appears torn between wanting to halt China's rise at any cost and hoping for \"a big and very comprehensive deal\" that lifts the cloud of a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute scholar close to the Trump team who has long warned of China's strategic threat, sees three plausible scenarios. At one extreme is a new cold war with drastically curtailed economic ties. At the other, the U.S. and China resolve their tensions, continue to integrate and run the world together.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Between those extremes, Mr. Pillsbury sees a more likely and desirable middle path -- a transactional U.S.-China relationship of the sort that prevailed during the 1980s in which the two decide, case by case, when to do business and when to decouple.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though administration officials haven't publicly embraced such a policy, their actions conform to it, most clearly in their intensified efforts to find, publicize and punish wrongdoing by Chinese companies and state actors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S.'s request to Canada to extradite an executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., like an earlier case against smart-phone maker ZTE</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corp., is for allegedly violating Iran sanctions. The cases also have the effect of clipping the wings of Chinese national champions. Meanwhile, Congress this year expanded the administration's authority to block foreign investments in the U.S., especially in technology, and stop exports that transfer U.S. technology abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the fate of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports hinges on current negotiations, some companies, from Lennox International Inc., which makes heating and cooling systems, to shoe manufacturer Steve Madden Ltd., said they are shifting supply chains out of China, further decoupling the two economies.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Many companies are . . . pursuing a 'China plus one' strategy, in which current China production remains largely in place but the marginal dollar of new investment goes into countries with lower labor costs,\" Dan Wang, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, recently wrote to clients.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is stepping up efforts to draw its other trading partners into a united front to take on China. U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer and his EU and Japan counterparts have launched an effort at the WTO to crack down on China's domestic subsidies and its technology-transfer requirements. The Group of 20 nations agreed at their recent summit to reform the WTO to address complaints it doesn't adequately police China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. and domestic concerns have prompted Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Britain and Canada to restrict or consider restricting Huawei equipment in their telecom infrastructure, in particular for the next 5G mobile phone standard.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. is also seeking to wall China off from future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. It insisted the pact replacing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> include a clause letting the U.S. quit if either Canada or Mexico signs a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with a \"non-market economy,\" i.e., China.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This realignment is fraught with risks -- for the U.S., China and the broader global economy -- beyond any short-term hit to growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The first goes to the heart of Mr. Trump's goal. If his aim is to hold back China's advance, economists predict he will fail. China's innovative capacity has expanded dramatically. China now accounts for 18.6% of articles in international scientific journals, according to one study, and nearly a quarter of global venture-capital investment, according to another.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, some China experts fear that the U.S., by adopting a more adversarial approach, weakens China's reformers and strengthens its nationalist factions, making conflict more likely. They predict China will intensify its pursuit of technological self-sufficiency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tom Linebarger, chief executive of engine maker Cummins Inc., represents the Business Roundtable, which supports a crackdown on China's discriminatory <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> practices but not a decoupling of the economies. \"The only thing worse than an unlevel playing field is no playing field at all,\" Mr. Linebarger said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Persuading other countries to hold China at arm's length will be harder than containing the Soviet Union. China accounts for 11% of world exports, whereas the Soviet Union in the 1980s accounted for less than 3%, not counting to Eastern Europe. China is 22% of Japanese imports and exports; the Soviet Union was less than 1%. Many of China's close neighbors depend far more, economically, on China than on the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The assumption behind some of the cold war, containment, decoupling rhetoric you hear rests on a fallacy -- that such a strategy is deliverable in the 21st century given the integrated nature of the global economy and the role of China,\" said Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who now heads the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials note that China's aid, such as its Belt and Road infrastructure program, often saddles recipients with debt. Yet the U.S. offers no alternative, said Mr. Rudd.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some of Mr. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies undermine the united front he wants against China. He hasn't sworn off protectionism against U.S. allies, promising to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> even if its replacement isn't ratified by Congress. His steel and aluminum tariffs, most of which remain in place, outraged such allies as Canada.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. officials play down such frictions as easily worked out. Abroad, they are seen as more serious. Canadian ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton said he told U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiators that if Mr. Trump carried through on his threatened 25% tariff on Canadian autos, it would fundamentally change bilateral relations for the worse for years to come. In a letter accompanying <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s replacement, the U.S. agreed not to levy the tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even among advocates of decoupling with China, a recurrent worry is that the current administration isn't up to the task. Said the American Enterprise Institute's Mr. Scissors: \"We can blow this. And if we blow it, we'll get a world economy that's poorer than it should be, with all the distortions and inconsistencies that come from unpredictable U.S. policy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By Greg Ip</p>\n"}
{"id": "2171052987.xml", "text": "<h2>Sherrod Brown Sends Regrets; The Democrat was supposed to support new Nafta. Guess not.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative Robert Lighthizer spent nearly as much effort last year courting Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown as he did Republicans while renegotiating <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. So how's that working out now that Donald Trump needs Democratic votes to pass the revised U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement (USMCA)?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I appreciate the efforts to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" Mr. Brown said</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>last week. \"But the president's not even close to being in the right place on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if he's not going to have strong enforcement for labor standards, which they don't have yet.\" Mark him down as a \"no.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Brown has suggested restarting negotiations with Mexico's new President, the left-wing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, \"who is more pro-worker than the outgoing President that signed USMCA.\" But Mexico says it has no desire to renegotiate and, even if it did, moving the deal even further left could cost Republican votes crucial to passage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another Democratic critic is Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, whose district includes the Chevy Cruze plant in Lordstown that is being shut down. Mr. Ryan said this month that new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s labor rules provide \"no real mechanism for quick enforcement,\" adding that \"there's gotta be penalties, there's gotta be ramifications.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This was all predictable. Mr. Lighthizer's bet was that by moving to the protectionist left on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>--mandating higher wages for Mexican auto workers, for example--Democrats and U.S. unions would come around. But Democrats don't like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals even when Democratic Presidents negotiate them. At most they provide a minority of pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> votes. That's why we urged Messrs. Lighthizer and Trump to renegotiate and vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> while Republicans ran the House.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats don't want to hand Mr. Trump a victory, and some of them probably hope that if they reject his new deal he'll respond by blowing up the current <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Some Republicans seem to think this would increase the President's leverage in trying to pass the USMCA deal. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley said this month that if Democrats insist on going back to the negotiating table, \"I would encourage the President to pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be political suicide. If Mr. Trump dynamites <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> without the votes to replace it, he'll take the blame for whatever economic harm results. Mr. Brown may run for President, so at least Mr. Trump would be guaranteed a good seat for President Brown's inaugural address.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: By The Editorial Board</p>\n"}
{"id": "2213564805.xml", "text": "<h2>This Time, Get Global Trade Right</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans have watched their neighbors lose good-paying jobs as their employers sent their livelihoods to China. Over the last 20 years, the United States has lost nearly five million manufacturing jobs. In that same time, however, the prices that Americans pay for basic goods like T-shirts and televisions have fallen. The cost of clothing is down 8.2 percent since 1993, as \u201cmade in China\u201d and \u201cmade in Bangladesh\u201d labels have crowded out \u201cmade in U.S.A.\u201d on the shelves of the local mall.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a national ambivalence about our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> of goods and services with the rest of the world, which has more than doubled in the last two decades. Americans want the benefits of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> \u2014 and they are potentially big and quite real, including opening up new markets to American cars and software \u2014 but they\u2019re increasingly anxious about the downside, which includes closed factories and lower wages. The country needs to pursue new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, but this time we need to get the agreements right.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This page has long argued that removing barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> benefits the economy and consumers, and some of those gains can be used to help the minority of people who lose their jobs because of increased imports. But those gains have not been as widespread as we hoped, and they have not been adequate to assist those who were harmed. As the Obama administration negotiates two big <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements \u2014 one with 11 countries along the Pacific Ocean and the other with the European Union \u2014 it is appropriate to take stock of what we have learned in the 20 years since the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and use that knowledge to design better agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To gain the support of a divided Congress and public, the administration must ensure that new agreements are much stronger than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other pacts. President Obama, who criticized the agreement with Canada and Mexico as a candidate in 2008, promised that his negotiations would avoid a race to lower costs and standards by requiring that countries adhere to common regulations in areas like labor rights, environmental protection and patents. Living up to that promise should be one of his highest priorities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If done right, these agreements could improve the ground rules of global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, as even critics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> like Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, have argued. They could reduce abuses like sweatshop labor, currency manipulation and the senseless destruction of forests. They could weaken protectionism against American goods and services in countries like Japan, which have sheltered such industries as agriculture and automobiles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Pacific agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, could also encourage China, which is not part of the talks, to reconsider its currency and labor policies to avoid being at a disadvantage. (The participants are Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, Peru and Brunei.) And a pact with the European Union could harmonize overlapping regulations to reduce the cost of doing business and increase competition. Both pacts could aid American foreign policy by strengthening alliances in Asia and Europe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>WELCOMING BUSINESS, NOT THE PUBLIC One of the biggest fears of lawmakers and public interest groups is that only a few insiders know what is in these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, particularly the Pacific pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration has revealed so few details about the negotiations, even to members of Congress and their staffs, that it is impossible to fully analyze the Pacific partnership. Negotiators have argued that it\u2019s impossible to conduct <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks in public because opponents to the deal would try to derail them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the administration\u2019s rationale for secrecy seems to apply only to the public. Big corporations are playing an active role in shaping the American position because they are on industry advisory committees to the United States <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, Michael Froman. By contrast, public interest groups have seats on only a handful of committees that negotiators do not consult closely.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That lopsided influence is dangerous, because companies are using <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements to get special benefits that they would find much more difficult to get through the standard legislative process. For example, draft chapters from the Pacific agreement that have been leaked in recent months reveal that most countries involved in the talks, except the United States, do not want the agreement to include enforceable environmental standards. Business interests in the United States, which would benefit from weaker rules by placing their operations in countries with lower protections, have aligned themselves with the position of foreign governments. Another chapter, on intellectual property, is said to contain language favorable to the pharmaceutical industry that could make it harder for poor people in countries like Peru to get generic medicines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another big issue is whether these <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements will give investors unnecessary power to sue foreign governments over policies they dislike, including health and environmental regulations. Philip Morris, for example, is trying to overturn Australian rules that require cigarette packs to be sold only in plain packaging. If these treaties are written too loosely, big banks could use them to challenge new financial regulations or, perhaps, block European lawmakers from enacting a financial-transaction tax.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>SEEKING THE REAL SOURCE OF JOB LOSS Could these agreements lead to further job losses and exacerbate income inequality in the United States? Many critics are legitimately concerned about more outsourcing of jobs, and there is no doubt that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, along with automation and financial deregulation, has contributed to income inequality.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But it\u2019s important to remember that our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-agreement countries, like Mexico, is much more balanced than our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China. Those countries buy more American goods and services than they would without an agreement, sending money and jobs back in this direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A study published last year blamed increased imports from China for 44 percent of the decline in manufacturing employment from 1990 to 2007. People who lost those jobs were more likely to stop seeking work or to find lower-wage jobs in other industries, suggesting that government programs to retrain workers hurt by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are inadequate. A second paper by the same scholars concluded that the negative impact of imports from Mexico and Central American nations with which the United States has agreements were \u201ceconomically small and statistically insignificant.\u201d</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It\u2019s easy to point the finger at <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements for job losses, but there is a far bigger culprit: currency manipulation. A 2012 paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit has increased by up to $500 billion a year and the country has lost up to five million jobs because China, South Korea, Malaysia and other countries have boosted their exports by suppressing the value of their currency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HOW TO WRITE A BETTER AGREEMENT The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements the Obama administration is negotiating provide a chance for the United States to press countries to stop manipulating their currencies. The administration appears to be afraid that raising the issue could scuttle the talks. It\u2019s time the administration stiffened its spine.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president also needs to make clear to America\u2019s trading partners that they need to adhere to enforceable labor and environmental regulations. This would level the playing field for American workers and improve the lives of tens of millions of workers in developing countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Obama administration also needs to do much more to counter the demands of corporations with those of the public interest. Consumer and workers groups should have been on the same industry advisory committees. And Mr. Froman, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative, must make clear that these agreements will allow countries to adopt regulations without the threat of a lawsuit from powerful businesses. On patents, the agreements should not cut off developing countries\u2019 access to lifesaving generic medicines.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In recent months the debate about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, and the Pacific agreement in particular, has become increasingly polarized. Senior Democrats like the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, have come out against granting the president <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promotion authority, under which Congress agrees to vote up or down on agreements without amendments.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To a large extent, the administration has only itself to blame. By keeping secret so much information about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> negotiations, which have ceased to be purely about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> matters like tariffs and quotas, the government has made itself a target for criticism. Mr. Obama and Mr. Froman argue that their critics have misunderstood or misrepresented their intentions. But that is precisely why the president should provide answers to the questions people have raised about these agreements. It is time for him to make a strong case for why these new agreements will be good for the American economy and workers.</p>\n"}

Rather than actual advancement toward open and equitable access to global markets, for the United States and for all countries, progress now means avoiding retreat from that goal. By that heavily discounted measure, there was progress on two fronts this week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday,</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump agreed to drop the steel and aluminum tariffs he had levied against Canada and Mexico on spurious national security grounds. In return, he received an end to those two neighbors' retaliatory tariffs and a pledge from them to do more to prevent the transshipment of metals from China, whose subsidized overproduction is at the root of the international metals industries' woes. Ending these tariffs removes what politicians in all three countries, including key Republicans in the Senate, had branded an obstacle to ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Mr. Trump's replacement for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To be sure, the USMCA epitomizes our discounted definition of progress, because it actually diminishes free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the crucial automotive sector (while adding some modest, and necessary, updates to the current North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement). Mr. Trump's threatened alternative, however - a U.S. renunciation of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and a breakdown in hemispheric commerce - would be worse.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump postponed for six months a decision on whether to hit foreign automakers with new tariffs. The alternative was to impose them pursuant to a review process that the president ordered last year, which found auto imports, most of which come from Germany and Japan, to be a threat to national security, despite the fact that many U.S. consumers like Audis, Mazdas and the rest, and that those two countries have mutual defense treaties with the United States. With passenger vehicles imports worth $191.7 billion last year, and an additional $158.8 million of vehicle parts potentially affected (directly or indirectly), the threatened tariffs faced tremendous resistance from both U.S. automakers and those abroad, who understand the fragility of carefully constructed international supply chains. This has apparently stayed Mr. Trump's hand, pending further talks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reduced tensions with trading partners in Europe, Asia and the Western hemisphere  let the Trump administration focus its attention on negotiations with China, where it has the strongest argument for playing hardball. It is even possible that traditional U.S. friends, who have their own disagreements with Chinese mercantilism, might rally to Mr. Trump's side in that contest, even at this late date and despite the gratuitous fights he has picked with them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A united front against China is the strategy Mr. Trump should have pursued from the beginning, and it's far from a sure thing he can organize an effective collective effort now. As we said, though, the first step in making things better is to cease making them worse.</p>\n"}

{"id": "2254996726.xml", "text": "<h2>The lesson of Ross Perot: However flawed the messenger \u2014 listen</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm all ears!\" With that self-deprecating one-liner in a debate against President George H.W. Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, H. Ross Perot defined his 1992 presidential bid.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The line was candy for TV producers seeking a soundbite from the debate, and it not only winningly mocked Perot's rather large ears but also served as a signal to the country that he was listening to folks the elites had ignored.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot, who died Tuesday at age 89, garnered nearly  1 out of 5 votes in that election, despite running against an incumbent president who'd successfully ousted Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and an Arkansas governor who proved to be the one of the most gifted political talents of his time. Why did an eccentric Texas billionaire capture the largest share of the vote of any third-party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sure, Perot was quirky, quotable and charismatic. But he was also substantive. His infomercials and his charts were about ideas, not self-aggrandizement. He had a clear, focused message: Stop the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement and balance the budget. He had other issues, including cleaning up corruption in Washington, supporting abortion rights and opposing Bush's Gulf War. But <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the deficit were the driving issues of Perot's candidacy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After winning the White House, my boss , Clinton, studied the results. Whereas others dismissed Perot as a kook and a flake, Clinton focused not on the man but on the movement. Nineteen million Americans were trying to tell our nation something. Clinton decided he'd better be all ears, too, so he adjusted. He confronted Perot where he felt he had to: on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. But he also took Perot seriously \u2014 so seriously that the White House sent Vice President Al Gore to debate Perot on CNN in November 1993. Gore crushed Perot, and yet the debate itself showed respect to the millions of people who wanted their voices heard. Clinton added side agreements to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that were designed to protect environmental and labor rights. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed because Clinton adapted, and he adapted because he respected Perot's voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the deficit, Clinton did more than adapt; he refocused. In the 1992 campaign, he pledged to cut the deficit by half in four years. At the time, the promise seemed audacious. But Perot listened to folks who saw the deficit as a Rorschach of everything that was wrong with Washington: buck-passing, blame-assigning and can-kicking. Perot called the deficit \"a crazy aunt you keep down in the basement. All the neighbors know she's there, but nobody talks about her.\" Clinton loved that formulation, which I often repeated while doing an impression of Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The combination of Perot's remarkable performance in the election and the urgent advice of his economic team persuaded Clinton to make deficit reduction a central pillar of his economic plan; indeed, he left his successor a federal budget surplus of $86.4 billion. I am not sure we would have ever balanced the budget without the pressure Perot and his voters brought to the issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perot could have been dismissed because he got no electoral votes (yet another illustration of how the electoral college stands in opposition to the will of the people). And his eccentricities distracted many observers. For crying out loud, the guy accused Bush of having a secret plan to disrupt his daughter's wedding. Clinton decided that he would ignore the zaniness and instead turn to winning over Perot's voters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is a lesson here for both parties. It is tempting for Democrats to dismiss supporters of President Trump as racists, misogynists or ignoramuses. And it is nearly irresistible to obsess on Trump's serial scandals and his woeful lack of character. At the same time, too many Republicans show raw contempt for the resurgent left: They personally attack Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), or mock those who are calling for a radical restructuring of an economic system they see as rigged.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is not the lesson of Ross Perot. However flawed the messenger, however misguided the policy proposal, when millions of people are crying out \u2014 in pain, in frustration, in anger \u2014 the best response of a leader is to listen. The same is true in real life. As I approach my 30th wedding anniversary, I delight in telling our kids that the secret to a long relationship is three little words. Not \"I love you,\" but \"I hear you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If politicians today want to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle quality of Perot's quixotic, chaotic, hypnotic campaign, the first thing they should do is grow a pair of Perot-sized ears.</p>\n"}

As I have said publicly in the past, I believe that Donald Trump was elected president because he gave voice to the legitimate rage many Americans feel about decades of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that have devastated communities nationwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The federal government has certified that almost 1 million U.S. jobs have been lost to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and millions more have been lost to misguided China <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. The Trump administration has promised to bring down massive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits and stop the outsourcing of jobs, but the president's policies have yet to deliver.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fixing the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that for decades not only failed to deliver their promised benefits but also undermined the nation's economic well-being is essential. Doing so will help to sustain and create the good-paying jobs that will rebuild a beleaguered middle class and protect an industrial base that is vital to U.S. national security.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That is why congressional Democrats are insisting on critical improvements to the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that President Trump signed last year. If the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is more accurately described as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0, were enacted in its current form, it wouldn't stop the American job outsourcing that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> incentivizes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The USMCA's labor and environmental standards and their enforcement are insufficient to stop corporations from continuing to move jobs to Mexico so they can pay employees less and dump toxins. Today, Mexican workers are paid 40 percent less than manufacturing workers in China and less than before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 25 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After decades of Republican and Democratic presidents alike enacting and defending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that harm working families, more than 160,000 jobs in my home state of Michigan already have been government-certified as lost to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> alone. But contrary to conventional wisdom about its impact on manufacturing centers in the Midwest, the greatest concentration of job losses from the pact is in the congressional district around El Paso and in California. Southern states have also been hard-hit.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The race to the bottom, with the outsourcing of jobs and pollution, continues today. A U.S. firm opened a multimillion-dollar tire plant in Mexico recently where they pay workers $2 to $6 per hour to make the exact same tires that the firm's American workers are paid, on average, $23 per hour to produce. Chevrolet is paying autoworkers in Mexico less than $3 per hour to make Blazers shipped back to the United States for sale. U.S. workers making Blazers a decade ago earned more per hour than these workers make in a day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This year, Mexico passed labor-law reforms required by the revised <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> that are a step in the right direction. Unless the new Mexican labor agencies and inspections this new law requires are funded and staffed, wages for many Mexican workers will remain at sweatshop levels. Reasons to be skeptical: Dozens of lawsuits have been filed to block the new law, and Mexico recently issued a labor-agency budget that doesn't appear to include the level of funding needed to make the improvements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 would fail to discourage outsourcing by U.S. companies, but it also would</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lock in high medicine prices by giving new monopoly protections to pharmaceutical companies. That would allow them to charge North American consumers even more. Even as Trump talks about lowering drug prices, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> 2.0 would undermine changes that Congress wants to enact to accomplish just that.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These realities explain why congressional Democrats have insisted on further changes. The president must add enforcement of improved labor and environmental standards to counter job outsourcing, and the Mexican government must implement and fund these improvements. And the new monopoly protection for pharmaceutical firms must come out.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>China's unfair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies must also be addressed. The president is right about that.

That's the best case now for supporting Mr. Trump's revisions to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement to gain votes from Democrats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The good news is that the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal puts to rest Mr. Trump's threats to abandon the 1994 agreement and blow up continental <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The new deal preserves most of the tariff-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the original <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's no small matter when through October this year U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico and Canada exceeded $1 trillion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That will be a relief to U.S. farmers in particular. Mexico and Canada bought some $38 billion in U.S. farm exports in 2016, up from less than $9 billion in 1993 before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. The new agreement also opens the Canadian dairy market to U.S. producers for the first time, even if still too modestly.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's particular political value in committing both Mexico's President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the left-wing economic nationalist known as AMLO, and Mr. Trump, the Republican mercantilist, to open trading rules for North America. This is especially important for Mexico, which is backsliding under AMLO's policies after decades of economic progress. If Americans think illegal immigration is a problem now, watch what happens if Mexico slides into Argentine or Venezuelan socialism. Economic integration with the U.S. is important insurance against Mexico becoming a failed state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The shame is that in many respects the new deal is worse than <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, especially its bows to politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The new deal tries to steer auto investment with new rules of origin that 75% of a car's content must be made in North America, up from 62.5% under <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This raises the cost of manufacturing, making North American products less competitive worldwide.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also reducing North American competitiveness is a new rule mandating that 40% of an auto qualifying for tariff-free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the region has to be produced by workers earning $16 an hour. Mandating wage rates ignores the relationship between productivity and output and sets a bad precedent for future <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. Mr. Trump is using the mandate to make Mexico less competitive for car production.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump Administration made these labor provisions worse in concessions to the AFL-CIO to get Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow a vote on the House floor. The unions battered Mexico to allow a new enforcement process that will give American unions a new way to intrude in Mexican labor disputes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If American activists complain about labor practices at a plant in Mexico, the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Representative can call for a multilateral panel to rule on the dispute. If the three-person panel rules in favor of the complaint, the U.S. can then impose tariffs in escalating stages. The risk is that this will produce a flood of new complaints.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>North American auto production costs will also rise thanks to a new layer of protection for U.S. steel. The new deal mandates that 70% of steel used in North American vehicles must be made on the continent, and in seven years that share will have to include so-called slab steel that is now often imported before it is finished into specific steel products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. auto companies say they can live with these higher costs, but other manufacturers may not. Some may find it makes more sense instead pay the 2.5% most-favored-nation tariff to import. Others will move full manufacturing to Mexico for vehicles and other products they export, reducing investment in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Trump also bowed to the Pelosi Democrats' demand to remove the 10-year protection for data exclusivity on biologics, a blow to one of America's growth industries. This won't change current U.S. law, which allows 12 years of protection, but Mexico allows only five and Canada eight. The new deal sends a signal that the world can loot American property rights\u2014and American politicians will cheer them on. This is the opposite of \"America first.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>***</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We thought Mrs. Pelosi would deny a vote on new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as she did four other <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals in 2007, and on that point <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Rep Robert Lighthizer was right. But the deal could have been better for free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> had it been presented when Republicans ran the House. Our concern now is that the deal's concessions to politically managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will become the new baseline for future negotiations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higher production costs and protection for politically influential industries won't help workers.

{"id": "2413600172.xml", "text": "<h2>Editorial: Trump has his new NAFTA. But is it any better than the original?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's one thing you can say for President Trump's biggest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact so far: The new version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is better than the one Trump originally negotiated a year ago. House Democrats and the Trump administration announced a number of changes Tuesday that will make the agreement more enforceable, likely assuring its passage through Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once approved, the agreement will replace the 25-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, a landmark deal that aimed to boost growth by leveling barriers to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> within the continent. And while <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did that, more than tripling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the countries, its benefits in the United States were offset in part by the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs to Mexico and some wage stagnation (although the blame for that may rest with globalization in general).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In other words, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was overdue for an update that would hold Mexico to higher standards while also acknowledging the rise in online commerce. The original deal Trump struck does those things, and the changes negotiated with Democrats improves on them. The biggest downside of the latest version is that the two sides didn't change one major provision that pushed the new deal away from the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> ambitions of its predecessor, and toward a costlier effort to manage <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on the continent.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's not a huge surprise, considering that free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs were largely absent from the negotiations between House Democrats and the Trump administration. Trump had proclaimed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a disaster that cost many Americans their jobs, and labor-aligned Democrats had opposed that pact from the start.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The mere fact that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal with the House Democratic leadership in the middle of the Democrats' efforts to impeach the president is proof of Washington's ability to compartmentalize. And both sides had a clear incentive to get a deal done: Trump had promised during the 2016 campaign to end <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as we know it, and House Democrats have come under withering fire from Republicans for allegedly focusing on impeachment to the exclusion of any other work. Although that wasn't true later this week, for example, the House is expected to pass a major bill to lower prescription drug costs and expand Medicare benefits the new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal offered the chance to produce something tangible that wasn't likely to die in the Senate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, some liberal groups argued against striking any deal with Trump because it would help him politically without delivering the improvements to labor and environmental protections that they coveted. But that's ridiculous, given that the alternative Trump has threatened credibly, given his dislike of multilateral agreements is no <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal at all.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One of the main wins for the United States in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals it obtains is the pressure they place on our trading partners to raise their wages, working conditions, labor organizing rights, emissions regulations and other commercial and industrial standards closer to U.S. levels. There's no question that the revised version of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada pact does a better job ensuring that those higher standards will be met than the original version did. That's to the Democrats' credit, as is the elimination of a provision that would have expanded patent protection for new biologic drugs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the other hand, the new version would still impose significantly tougher requirements on all automotive manufacturers in the region, requiring 70% of the steel and aluminum and 75% of the parts to be made in North America in order to avoid tariffs. The mandate will cost consumers, automotive industry workers or both because it disrupts the global supply chains that even domestic manufacturers rely on to make their products more competitive, and it imposes inefficiencies that automakers may seek to avoid simply by moving car production elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Happily, most of the provisions in the new agreement are copied either from the 1994 <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> deal or from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump renounced after taking office, so on balance it should promote <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> rather than hindering it. And clearly, the new version is better than Trump returning us to the pre-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> status quo.</p>\n"}

But the problems he railed about are real.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kathleen Kingsbury, acting editorial page editor, wrote about the editorial board's verdict on Donald Trump's presidency in a special edition of our Opinion Today newsletter. You can   read it here  .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Trump presidency has been such a five-alarm fire that many people are understandably consumed with trying to put out the flames or simply survive it. But there will come a day, hopefully in the not too distant future, when people have the breathing room to investigate how the fire got started.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's tempting to heap scorn and blame on President Trump's millions of enthusiastic supporters. Without their adoration, he wouldn't have been able to do the damage he has done. But there are good reasons to refrain. Calling large swaths of the American electorate deplorable turns out to be an ineffective way to gain their backing.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another reason: The mess the nation faces is bigger than Donald Trump. If he is voted out in November, the people who cast ballots for him will remain, pining for the policies he promoted. About 40 percent of American voters want tariffs and a border wall. More than half say it's important to deport more undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much ink has been spilled about whether Trump supporters voted for him out of economic anxiety or racial anxiety, with plenty of studies concluding the latter. But spend time at a dying factory and you might see how difficult it can be to disentangle the two.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the past four years, I've followed a group of steelworkers in Indiana -- men and women, Black and white -- who had worked at a factory that moved to Mexico. I watched them agonize about whether to train their Mexican replacements, or stand with their union and refuse. I watched them grieve the plant like a parent. I followed them as they applied for new jobs, some of which paid half as much as they made before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A machinist named Tim carried his steelworker union card in his wallet for years after the factory closed, just to remind himself who he was. Tim grew up in a union household. His dad had been an autoworker; his grandfather, a coal miner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We always voted Democrat because they looked after the little man,\" Tim told me. \"My father went to his grave and I can guarantee you he never voted for a Republican.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tim had such faith in Democrats that he didn't worry when President Bill Clinton pushed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement over the finish line in 1993. Nor did he worry when Mr. Clinton normalized <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China in 2000. But then the factory where Tim worked moved to Shanghai. And the next one moved to Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>By the time I met Tim, he loathed the Clintons and the Democratic Party. Democrats had gotten in bed with the corporations, while no one was looking. Tim felt betrayed, and politically abandoned -- until Mr. Trump came along.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>College-educated people scoffed at Mr. Trump's promises to bring back the factories. The factories are never coming back, they insisted. But even false hope is a form of hope, perhaps the most ubiquitous kind.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There is little doubt that Mr. Trump is president today because of blue-collar people like Tim who were once a reliable pillar of the Democratic Party. About 55 percent of voters who expected to support Mr. Trump during the 2016 primaries identified as working class, according to a 2015 study by the Public Religion Research Institute. Fewer than a third who backed other Republican candidates identified as such.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mahoning County, Ohio, more than a quarter of people who voted in the Republican primary were ex-Democrats, according to The Washington Post. Eighteen members of the county's Democratic central committee crossed over to cast ballots for Mr. Trump, the county's Democratic chairman told The Post.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those defections stemmed in part from anger over millions of factory jobs that went to China in the 2000s. Workers who made instrument panels for G.M. trucks in Michigan, stitched shirts in Pennsylvania and sanded wooden dressers in North Carolina saw alarming increases in child poverty, single motherhood, deaths from alcohol and drugs and reliance on public assistance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Exposure to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with China led to \"sizable increases in the likelihood of G.O.P. victory in majority-white non-Hispanic congressional districts from 2002-2010,\" said a study co-written by David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hillary Clinton would have won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- and thus the presidency -- in 2016 had the economic blow of imports from China been half as big, the report concluded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is worth noting that many of those same counties that hemorrhaged factory jobs also saw large increases in undocumented immigrants competing for the unskilled jobs that remained -- cleaning hotel rooms, slaughtering chickens and mowing lawns. Their arrival fueled still more resentment of the world beyond America's borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Anger about globalization is not confined to the right. It fueled the rise of Bernie Sanders, who won the endorsement of the steelworkers I followed. The same week I met Tim, I interviewed an anarchist facing criminal charges for his role in the disruption of Mr. Trump's inauguration when windows were smashed and a limousine was set on fire. Why had he became an anarchist? <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the tyranny of global capitalism, he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To many, that anger can seem silly or misplaced. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and globalization have undoubtedly made the country richer. But those riches have flowed disproportionately to the few with capital and education, while globalization's downsides have piled on the shoulders of the most vulnerable Americans.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has come to symbolize a world order crafted by elites, for elites. The deal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>d away blue-collar factory jobs in exchange for white-collar opportunities to invest in Mexico's banking and insurance sectors. Today, even its biggest supporters admit that it resulted in a net loss of American jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In hindsight, it seems inevitable that globalization would cause a backlash. During the height of euphoria about free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the 1990s, the philosopher Richard Rorty predicted that workers \"will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported.\" At that point, he wrote, parts of the electorate \"will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for -- someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In countries from Britain to Brazil, voters have elected leaders who promised to reverse decades of international economic integration. Most of those populist movements are right wing. The rebellion against free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and globalization has largely taken the left by surprise. Dani Rodrik, an economics professor at Harvard who is perhaps the country's most prominent skeptic of unfettered globalization, lamented in an article a few months before Mr. Trump's election that left-wing parties around the world had failed to present viable alternatives to protectionism and walls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Since then, the landscape has changed. Joe Biden, who once whole-heartedly embraced free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, acknowledges the harm it's inflicted on the working class. Mr. Biden's economic plan includes a 10 percent tax on businesses that send manufacturing offshore, and a 10 percent tax credit for companies that bolster job growth inside the United States. He has also put forth a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years on green energy infrastructure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Biden, the nominally centrist candidate, has a platform that is far more progressive than Hillary Clinton's on economics,\" Mr. Rodrik told me in an email. \"But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we will see whether Biden will deliver real change if elected.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many Americans who longed for a strongman will vote for Mr. Trump again. They revere him for tearing up <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> (even if the new version looks an awful lot like the old one) and slapping tariffs on Chinese imports and Korean washing machines (even if his unpredictable <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war forced the deepest contraction in the manufacturing sector in a decade).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet, working-class voters who look a little deeper will notice something strange about their perceived champion: He is against unions. His first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, helped erode the ability of unions to collect dues and fees in a landmark case. Another strange thing: The Trump administration's interim <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal with China focuses far more on opening up the Chinese banking and insurance sectors than on creating blue-collar jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Also, Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut favored corporations and shareholders -- including those who aren't American citizens. Money that would have flowed into the U.S. Treasury went instead into their pockets and deep bank accounts. The companies used much of it to buy back their own stock, making their owners richer, instead of hiring and training new workers or increasing pay. The buybacks were so shameless that even Mr. Trump couldn't defend them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We thought they would have known better,\" he told reporters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Trump is the one who should have known better. He's either incompetent or he's a Trojan horse who used blue-collar workers to get into the White House, only to hand over the keys to the one percent. Now that the Trump administration is trying to kill the Affordable Care Act, which millions of people depend on in the middle of a pandemic, it could not be more clear whose side he is on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Health care is one of the things that sent Shannon, a steelworker I followed in Indiana, back to the Democrats, even though most people in her family still support Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"He's bragging that he's saving all these jobs,\" she told me. \"But he's not.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

{"id": "2782848360.xml", "text": "<h2>The politics of trade favor Trump in 2024</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Donald Trump is, once again, making big promises on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. If he is elected president in 2024, he says, he will impose new tariffs that will \"end our gaping <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficits,\" \"bring back millions of American jobs,\" and \"bring trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury from foreign countries.\" He says this influx of money will allow taxes on U.S. producers to come down. We just need to build on the successes of his administration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These hopes are absurd. As a matter of policy, Trump's record on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is largely one of failure. But his message has been politically successful and could be again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's projections of an influx of jobs and federal revenue don't make sense because the more effective the tariffs are at protecting U.S. companies, the less money they would raise. You can't tax an import that you have prevented from happening. For tariffs to raise a lot of money, imports have to stay high.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throw his predictions, then, on the pile of Trump's broken <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> promises.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, known as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, wasn't ended, as he claims. It was just given an update and a makeover.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peter Navarro, a top aide to Trump on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, predicted that new tariffs would not lead to any retaliation from other countries. Instead, the European Union, Russia, Turkey, India and China all retaliated \u2014 so much so in the last case that almost all of the revenue from tariffs on Chinese products had to be spent taking care of American farmers who were casualties of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> war.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tariffs on Chinese imports might have been worth their costs, retaliation and all, if they had induced the communist regime to end its intellectual property theft, scale back its industrial subsidies or otherwise improve its behavior. The main commitment that Trump won from China was to purchase more American products, especially agricultural ones. China, doubtless in part because of covid, didn't fulfill its end of the bargain. And China's state capitalism remains in place.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tariffs were supposed to boost employment at home by shrinking the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit. They didn't. In Trump's last year in office, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit was higher than it was in Barack Obama's last year, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the economy. The manufacturing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit, an item of special concern for Trump, rose on his watch, too.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>None of these results have, however, led to any serious political challenge to Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies. Instead, his tariffs have become an item of bipartisan consensus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When President Biden took office, he surveyed the tariffs' comprehensively disappointing record and \u2026 decided to stick with them. Trump's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers on steel and aluminum from Europe, Britain, Japan and elsewhere have been tweaked but not lifted. The tariffs on Chinese imports are still there.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump's leading potential rival for the Republican nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, voted in line with the rest of the pre-Trump party when he served in the U.S. House, where he helped to pass a bill giving presidents the authority to negotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Nowadays, he is criticizing the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the naivete of previous U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy toward China. DeSantis has been no more critical of Trump's forays in protectionism than of anything else Trump has done.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Trump, in short, is setting the pace for both parties on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues. That's not because public opinion has turned markedly away from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>: Gallup finds that Americans are more likely to consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> an opportunity, and less likely to consider it a threat, than they were 10 years ago. That's especially true among Democrats.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Biden prides himself, however, on maintaining solidarity with labor unions, and they remain keen on restrictions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. He also wants to avoid being called soft on China. Both parties seem to have decided that protectionism appeals to a crucial group of up-for-grabs voters \u2014 White people from industrial states without college degrees \u2014 and is therefore a winning rhetorical stance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That doesn't necessarily mean we have a lot more <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in our future. Even Trump, who was much more protectionist than his predecessors, didn't follow through on all his bluster. That's why <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which he called the worst <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal ever made by our country, largely survived. Congress almost certainly lacks the votes to pass a major increase in tariffs or to withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements, and that is unlikely to change in the next election or two. The U.S. economy, judging by <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> flows, is as globalized as ever.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But we are not going to see much <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization, either, even as China and others make their own <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. The politics of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will favor Trump in 2024 \u2014 no matter how little he deserves the advantage.</p>\n"}
{"id": "293352781.xml", "text": "<h2>Failed Promises Are Turning the Tide Against NAFTA; Trade: Bills surface demanding an audit of broken promises about lost U.S. jobs, border pollution, immigration.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the majority of Mr. and Mrs. America was convinced that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would result in the loss of industries and jobs to Mexico, no fewer than five U. S. presidents, the majority of House and Senate members (including Bob Dole) and legions of academic economists, bankers and multinationals all swore to the contrary: The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they promised, would be a \"win-win\" for American and Mexican workers. They ridiculed those who held any lesser view, particularly Ross Perot and his \"sucking sound\" of jobs going south.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, all policies face their hour of accountability. In the case of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, it is taking the form of bills by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Kaptur represents the industrial Toledo area, which has suffered massive plant shutdowns and the loss of a great many of those jobs to Mexico. The Almanac of American Politics calls her \"probably Congress' most vocal and dedicated opponent of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" and when Bill Clinton's campaign train rumbled through the Rust Belt on the way to the Democratic convention, Kaptur was out front giving the president hell.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When Congress returned from its convention break, Kaptur's bill, called the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> Accountability Act, already had 108 cosponsors. Basically, it points out that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was passed on promises to the American people that it would increase their (and Mexicans') standard of living, reduce illegal immigration, improve environmental and health conditions on the border and slow the drug <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Now it is time to assess results. The bill would require the administration to certify that these goals have been achieved. If they haven't, then the U.S. must renegotiate or withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proposal is sending shock waves through the ranks of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> supporters who realize that such an audit would probably not pass muster. In fact, there is sufficient data showing that economic, immigration, drug trafficking and environmental conditions on both sides of the border have deteriorated, not improved.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The proponents of the Kaptur and Dorgan bills are pressing for the following promise/reality check:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will create American jobs. Before <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s implementation, the U.S. had a positive <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> balance with Mexico of $1.7 billion. In 1995, two years after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the U.S. was running a net <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit of $15 billion. Since every $1 billion of exports or imports creates or destroys about 23,000 jobs, one can see that the U. S. has suffered a direct net job loss of approximately 391,000 jobs. An indication of this loss is evidenced by the 43,000 displaced workers who have already been certified to receive dislocation benefits under the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Adjustment Relief Act, the government's program for workers whose jobs have been lost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another indicator lies in the figures for the Big Three automakers' exports to Mexico, which rose to a meager 19,000 cars and trucks in 1995, while imports of vehicles made in Mexico topped out at 495,674.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* Environmental problems along the border will improve. Proponents of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> felt sure that much of the manufacturing being done in existing border free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zones, or maquiladoras, would move to the interior of Mexico, thus reducing environmental pressures on the border. However, the Mexican Commerce Ministry reported last January that the maquiladora work force actually grew 26% in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s first two years, from 546,588 to 742,700.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>* <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> will reduce illegal immigration. The thesis here was that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would so improve the standard of living in Mexico that Mexican workers would no longer want to come to the U.S. The opposite has happened: Economic mismanagement and the resulting chaos have driven many thousands of desperate Mexicans north.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kaptur and Dorgan bills seek to assess this reality gap. They call for the president to renegotiate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> if the U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with any of the other parties exceeds 10% of U.S. exports to that country. They direct the president to mitigate any adverse effect of rapid changes in currency exchange rates, as has happened with the peso. They direct the president to renegotiate the terms of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> for agricultural commodities. They require certification of gains in U. S. jobs and living standards attributable to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>; certification that conditions affecting public health have improved along the U.S.-Mexican border; and certification that human and political rights are respected and that increased imports do not result in increased importation of drugs. Finally, they bar expansion of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> until these conditions are met. And if they are not, the U.S. is to renegotiate or withdraw from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's a good bet that both the Kaptur and Dorgan bills will pass and an equally good bet that the president will never be able to certify compliance. The end of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? The first major challenge to U.S. free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> philosophy?

{"id": "293459078.xml", "text": "<h2>Ernesto Zedillo ..DH: Tackling Economic Crises, Corruption and Political Violence in Mexico</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No Mexican president in modern times has faced the array of problems--from economic crisis to armed insurrection--that Ernesto Zedillo has in his first 21 months in office. Yet, Zedillo does not appear overwhelmed. Indeed, he is no longer the accidental candidate who filled the political vacuum created by the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, his party's presidential candidate, in March 1994. Zedillo confidently predicts that he will pull his country out of its state of emergency in the near future.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately for him, such confidence is not widely shared in other quarters of Mexico--especially where there are strong doubts about Zedillo's abilities as a leader.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until now, the Zedillo administration, with public support, has been able to pass most of the blame for the country's ills onto the previous administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. This has given Zedillo the freedom to make progress on some key fronts. He has adjusted the economy to a devalued peso and brought about the start of a recovery. He has successfully negotiated an agreement among Mexico's major political parties to achieve political reform. He has strengthened the muscle of the judiciary branch by reconstituting the supreme court and purging the ranks of the corrupted federal police. He has called in the military to cleanse Mexico City's police force. He claims to have captured the hired guns who killed Colosio and another prominent politician.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These accomplishments are undeniable, but Zedillo is still far from achieving success. Jobs lost during the severe economic recession have not been replaced. Businesses that went belly up after the peso was devalued in December 1994 have not reopened. His handling of the economy has drawn strong political opposition, even from within his own party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). A persistent wave of criminal violence, fed, in large part, by drug trafficking, plagues Mexico's cities and towns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there are Mexico's two continuing insurrections. In Chiapas, talks with Subcomandante Marcos and his Zapatistas have been suspended. In southern and central Mexico, an especially violent revolutionary group, known as the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), recently staged a series of daring attacks in six Mexican states, leaving 16 dead.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sitting in his office at Los Pinos, Zedillo, trim and fit, discussed these enormous problems sounding more like a scientist than a politician--but never ducking an opportunity to take on his critics. Yet, for many Mexicans, the question is whether their president has the fire to exercise the kind of authority needed to govern Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Question: You have made a distinction between the EPR and the Zapatistas. And, in fact, you have a strange type of official relationship with the Chiapas group. The government allows an armed group of people who want to overthrow the government to organize tours for Hollywood movie-makers. What is going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answer: Well, in Chiapas we are half-way solving the problem. We want to reach an agreement in which the government accepts the just social and political claims of this group and, in return, they disarm and join the political route to participate in the civic life of the country. In between, there is no violence, they keep their arms and are free to organize their propaganda activities.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Violence, however, has made a comeback and many analysts believe the national-security apparatus in Mexico has collapsed since 1994.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Violence has many varieties and is surfacing. But this is happening not only in Mexico. There seems to be a new wave of violence worldwide--sometimes even promoted by the media. In Mexico, we have had political assassinations, and we don't know yet what were the causes for those murders, because they are extremely complicated cases. The investigation continues its course. Regarding violence perpetrated by common criminals, the explanation is that our laws have been too lenient and our institutions have failed because they have not grown as the country has grown. Some of these institutions have been corrupted. So we're adjusting our laws to the times we are living in and reforming our institutions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Regarding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, there is a genuine concern of a sector of society, but some people are also using it for political gain. Do you see it that way?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I have always condemned the sensationalization and the extra-legal pressures used in this case. Almost every week, there is a new hypothesis of the killing. Everybody has the right to express an opinion, but sensationalism and extra-legal pressures dilute the search for truth and the achievement of justice. Some people would like me to become prosecutor and judge; to do so would be illegal and useless. What I have done, as president, is to ensure the absolute independence of the judiciary system . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: I know you don't believe there is a conspiracy in place since 1994, but do you believe there is a power struggle going on?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: No. I honestly don't believe there is a power struggle going on. It would be easy for me to say that the problems I face are the byproducts of a conspiracy, but that would be a lie . . . . Each one of the troubles we've gone through has its own logic.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In Mexico, the government is blamed for every problem, whether it is poverty or inequality or unemployment. What do you see as your responsibility?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility began Dec. 1, 1994, but the government has to confront each one of these problems. Poverty is a 500-year-old problem, but it is my problem now. Regarding our economic problems, I think they began three years ago. We went through a process of accumulation until the crisis burst . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: The crisis began three years ago?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes. We had a very high deficit in the current-account {balance} in 1992, '93 and '94, and we allowed ourselves to reach a situation that led us to the crisis. But that is irrelevant. Now that is my problem and I must solve it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: However, in April 1994, you told me, \"After 10 years of macroeconomic adjustments, we can now tell the people they will reap the benefits after so much sacrifice.\" Either you did not know what was happening or there were mistakes later. Also troubling is the fact that you were the programming and budget secretary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes, but up until 1991.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But you were the candidate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: That is a good question and let's deal with it. To run into a crisis, you have to link a series of events that individually would hardly create a crisis. It is like an accident. We had a serious dependency on foreign capital. Some saw this flow of capital as a positive sign, as a symbol of economic vitality, of confidence in our country. However, when some events shook the confidence of the foreign investor, the flow was read in a different light. Remember, the money for these so-called emergent markets came from new and different sources, the stock exchange, pension funds, etc. Nobody knew how they would behave in an emergent market if a given situation would turn out different from the norm. These were the factors we had to confront . . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason why we are coming out of this national emergency is precisely because the Mexican economy has a structural strength it had never had. After the 1982 crisis, it took us seven years to begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel, because our economy back then was obsolete, unproductive and incapable of functioning in the current global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you believe there should have been a devaluation before the election?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In retrospect, it is real easy to say that, and it certainly could have been much more comfortable to start my government with an economy in the process of a severe adjustment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But would you have won the election after a devaluation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: The only time I am aware that a devaluation was considered was on Nov. 20, 1994. That was 10 days before my inauguration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What happened in December '94, and who is responsible?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I wish the crisis had been the result of one decision--because it would not have been as big a crisis and it would have been easy to solve. We had a crisis because the country was spending more than it was producing. This took years, and then there were so many more issues involved. We had become addicted to flows of foreign capital, and these represented 7% or 8% of GNP. We also had to pay more than $41 billion in bonds, shares, Tesobonos, Cetes that matured around that date. These problems were not created in one day. We had to adjust the country back to reality and that is precisely what made an impact in the people's living standards.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some critics say you have a long-term vision, to build up an efficient, competitive economy, whereas the people have short-term needs--they want a job or higher wages. Is this a problem?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My responsibility is to work long term, but that does not mean we don't measure the short-term effects of long-term actions. If we had followed an adjustment program in '95, in the short term it would have meant more sacrifices for the people and it would have taken longer to overcome the economic emergency. Gradualism is not an option, because that would have taken us to total collapse and instead of loosing hundreds of thousands of jobs, we would have lost millions. My long-term policy is the best policy in the short term. Promises won't bring food to the table of the people.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: What most dominates the relationship between Mexico and the United States: conflict or cooperation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: It is a complex relationship that has many facets and many issues, some extremely difficult. This complexity forces a chiaro/oscuro type of relationship. President Clinton is very cooperative and has helped us in the most difficult of times. It took a lot of guts to support Mexico as he did. Fortunately, we have paid them back almost the whole loan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There's been respect when dealing with difficult issues--such as drug trafficking or immigration; but both countries have tried to solve problems as they come up. From time to time, we have problems like the Helms-Burton law, which I believe is a big mistake, because it violates international law. That is why it is creating so many problems with Canada, the European Union and us. But Helms-Burton cannot contaminate the whole relationship; I hope we can overcome this problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: President Clinton's special envoy for Cuba, Stuart Eizenstat, said, \"It would be a mistake to bring Helms-Burton into <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\" Did you interpret it as a threat or as a warning?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Maybe he said so because he knows we are right, and the U.S. view is wrong. They are asking us to promote democracy in Cuba; well, they should know Mexico has maintained, consistently for many decades, the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other nations. I believe democracy is the best political system, but I don't believe we have the right to interfere in Cuba's domestic affairs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Has the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement worked well for the United States but not for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has performed very well for its three partners. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> has increased in a meaningful way, and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> passed a difficult test in '95. During the Mexican recession, it is remarkable that our purchases in the U.S. did not fall and are now growing strongly again. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is no longer a topic for debate, because we are not talking theory now, but facts.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: After the November election in the U.S., couldn't you find a similar framework that would lead to a treaty on immigration?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: We have always been open to reach a permanent solution to this issue. The problem is that the existing economic disparity between both countries is what causes migration. The real solution will come with economic growth in Mexico, but that will take some time. Meanwhile, we should work out agreements to take care of the real demand for Mexican labor in the U.S. in an environment that respects human rights. This approach is difficult for the U.S., because it would mean legalizing many more immigrants than what is politically feasible.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: How would you describe yourself? Are you a weak president, as many people say?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: How arrogant and vain would it be that I define myself. I am not pursuing an \"image,\" because I cannot waste my time on those silly exercises. I have been through the hardest period ever for a president in modern Mexico, and when things are difficult, the people demand miraculous and messianic solutions. I have been responsible in avoiding promises no one can deliver. I have remained truthful through painful times. I try, deliberately, not to make authoritarian use of the presidential powers. One of the imperfections of our democracy has been its lack of equilibrium between the federal powers and among the three branches of government. My contribution has been to open spaces for other powers. Because nobody can accuse me of being a thief or corrupt or abusive, they say I am weak. That's fine. I answer my critics with deeds and tough decisions I have had to make without ever considering my index of popularity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: (ERNESTO ZEDILLO); PHOTOGRAPHER: PETER STONE / for The Times</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>ACCN-79918</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sergio Munoz is an editorial writer for The Times.

{"id": "398277030.xml", "text": "<h2>Global View: On Global Issues, Perot Sounds Texas League</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the G-7 economic summit in Munich this week George Bush and six other heads of government are tackling such knotty matters as how to help Russia avoid a dangerous economic collapse, how to break the Uruguay Round deadlock and how to regenerate world-wide economic growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Bush will be in an anomalous position. He is the most powerful national leader at Munich but is at the same time losing the support of voters at home. That would be more serious were it not for the fact that his fellow leaders, with the possible exception of John Major, are no better off. Whether that will make the seven chieftains more fraternal or more touchy in their deliberations is anyone's guess. Insecure politicians sometimes are better bedfellows than confident ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But since we are discussing Mr. Bush's political problems, let's imagine for a moment that the U.S. leader at Munich is not George Bush, but President Ross Perot. The diminutive Texan has been first choice in some recent popularity polls and is expected to announce his presidential candidacy soon. He can no longer be ignored, however unlikely it is that the well-justified anti-Beltway mood of the voters will translate into an actual Perot victory. Would Mr. Perot be any good at what is arguably the most important constitutional responsibility of an American President, the conduct of foreign policy?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What little evidence exists is not encouraging. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is the only foreign policy issue that Mr. Perot has addressed in any detail. His orientation was not that of a world leader but of a narrowly focused Texas businessman. Specifically, he attacked George Bush's efforts to bring the U.S., Canada and Mexico into a North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement (<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>). He treated a press conference to a twangy dissertation on why a businessman, under conditions of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, would \"naturally\" move his factory from the U.S. to Mexico to take advantage of lower wage and pension costs and other presumed advantages. American workers would suffer, he said.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In fact, this seemingly pragmatic logic is not pragmatic at all, even on its own narrow terms. Factory owners do not move production willy-nilly. They consider sunk costs in existing facilities. Nor do they locate new plants solely on the basis of raw labor costs. They consider proximity to markets, transportation costs, the educational level of the work force, the political stability of the host country, the willingness of managers to relocate, the availability of parts and raw materials and a good many other factors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Removal of tariff barriers in the European Community has not caused German manufacturers to move en masse to Greece or Portugal, even though labor costs certainly are lower there. What has in fact happened is that both the northern and southern countries of the EC have developed, as is invariably the case when restrictions on commerce are removed. Markets for both goods and labor become broader, allowing companies to take advantage of economies of scale and comparative advantage. It is a dynamic process, involving temporary job losses certainly but, on balance, upward mobility for able workers to better, more productive jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most Americans know all this intuitively. They have seen the world open up with new opportunities. Japanese auto companies create jobs in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Bavarische Motoren Werke AG of Germany has just announced a plan to build a $625 million assembly plant near Spartanburg, S.C., drawing parts and components from Germany, Austria, the U.S. and, yes, Mexico. As they see all this internationalization of business taking place around them, Americans consistently reject protectionist reaction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet here is Mr. Perot, in his first ventures into saying something that sounds like a policy position, using those old protectionist code words, \"level playing field\" and \"fair <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.\" Anyone who has spent many hours, as I have, listening to businessmen lobby for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers has heard it all many times.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the basis of what we know so far, a President Perot at Munich would be punching air with parochial slogans instead of furthering the interests of the U.S. and the world in a freer global business environment. John Major, who is trying to rid the United Kingdom of the vestiges of corporatism, would be appalled to hear a Ross Perot talking about assembling American CEO's to find ways to make the U.S. more competitive. He might suggest, if Mr. Perot cared to listen, that CEOs are better employed running their own companies than trying to collaborate with politicians on national industrial policy schemes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then there is the question of personality. An American President does not need to be a silky voiced diplomat, but he must take other national leaders seriously. Mr. Perot has seemed singularly incapable of taking anyone seriously other than himself. He described his fellow board members at General Motors as \"pet rocks.\" That made a hit with GM's critics but also signalled to Roger Smith that Mr. Perot's ego was far too large to allow him to be of much use in achieving the goal the two of them shared, a streamlining of the GM bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which poses the central problem of Ross Perot. The qualities that are winning him a political following are also the ones that cast doubts on his chances for a successful presidency. His fiesty, iconoclastic style raises hopes that he might be able to reassert presidential control over the U.S. government and wrench it out of the hands of Congress and the special interests Congress serves. But he has not said or done anything so far that suggests he is capable of such a feat. He is clearly bright but his few policy utterances, such as that dealing with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, suggest ignorance on major national and international issues. His one-man-band approach to problem solving ignores the fact that today the most important thing an American President can do is strengthen alliances against all the forces for political fragmentation that now are loose in the world. There are few of those alliances more important than the one with Japan, the bete noire of American protectionists. East Asia's potential for political instability is high and the U.S. has a large stake in that region, in the form of both <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and investment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At Munich, a President Perot would find himself face to face with men much more experienced in politics than he. None of them are \"pet rocks,\" he would soon find out. But they all would know, perhaps better than he, that the U.S. is not a competitive basket case but rather a very powerful country, both politically and economically. Should he not be able to supply the leadership they want, they would quickly search for alternatives. The world would get messier, and down-home homilies would be of no help.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398336933.xml", "text": "<h2>A better U.S. target in Japan--the consumer</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With the summit behind him, Kiichi Miyazawa has given Bill Clinton his best going-away present. He's told the president that Japan cannot accept Mickey Kantor's insistence on targets, but he has agreed to the growth of U.S. exports in Japan's market. Not a bad deal for the president, since export targets not only tend to become export ceilings, but would also have strengthened Japan's bureaucracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president can now move on to a new agenda, but he and his people are going to have to adopt a two-part strategy. First, they need to put away the bludgeon; all that does is confirm the deep fear of the Japanese that they are being victimized. Second, the U.S. will have to show that when we talk about a \"partnership\" we mean it. But that's going to require that the president's people do their homework on the real state of play in U.S.-Japanese <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Listening to the common wisdom that most of our top exports to Japan are raw materials -- such as maize, raw wood and fish -- won't do it. The reality is the opposite -- and has been for years. Easily 60% of our exports to Japan are manufactured goods, and most of them are of the hightech variety. The adjacent table shows the value of our top five exports through 1991, and in 1992 the top four categories were: $3.9 billion for transportation; $3.6 billion for office and automatic data processing equipment and parts; $2.6 billion for electrical machinery, and $2.4 billion for cork and wood.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Neither will listening to those who insist on talking down the dollar. That policy has been tried since 1985. The result is that while the volume of Japan's oil imports rose by 26% compared with 1985, its bill last year for oil and related products was just 39% of its 1985 cost.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason: Oil is denominated in dollars. That means we've given Japan a huge discount on its commodity imports, and at the same time nearly doubled the cost to U.S. firms of doing business in Japan. And the high cost of setting up in Japan, rather than tariffs or closed markets, was listed by Americans there as the chief deterrent to greater U.S. investment and exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president has got it right in targeting the Japanese consumer. For the best part of a year, Japan's press has been carrying stories about the rigged bids in the construction business, Liberal Democratic Party ties to gangsters, and what brought it all out -- the gold bars in Shin Kanemaru's house. All this confirmed what ordinary folks had long suspected: They are being ripped off; the prices they pay are crazily high, compared with just about anywhere else. More and more Japanese see this firsthand, since 10 million to 15 million of them travel overseas each year, a third to the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We had a good illustration when one of my wife's Japanese friends came to visit. The first place she wanted to see was the local Safeway: to confirm that a 20-pound bag of rice sells here for about $6 to $7, and not the $45 to $50 it brings in Japan. Sure, Japan's bubble has burst, but the U.S. has held its share of the Japanese market. Over the past two years, Japan's imports from the European Community dropped 10%, but from the U.S. hardly at all: Imports in 1990 were $52.4 billion; in 1992, $52.2 billion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, while the Japanese don't particularly welcome the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, they understand the pressures behind it. But how can the U.S. seriously consider extending <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Chile, and now to Argentina, when there are more attractive prospects in Asia? Singapore alone -- with just 2.8 million people -- buys more from the U.S. than those two, and South Korea and Taiwan add an additional $15 billion each.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every time the U.S. mentions Chile and Argentina as the next candidates for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- or worse yet inludes Singapore -- Japan begins to think about its trading partners in Asia. Unless Washington wants to promote a world of regional blocs, it needs to consider Korea, Taiwan and, yes, Japan in that format. Now that's a real eye-popper, designed to respond to Japan's new-found emphasis on reform and Bill Clinton's talk of a new agenda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gordon is a fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii and professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\n"}

He argues that companies would shift production to Mexico, where wages are about one-tenth of U.S. levels, then sell their products back into the U.S. market. \"If American manufacturers move offshore to stay competitive in our own markets, we're through,\" he warns.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Japan, whose approach to less-developed neighbors appeals to some Westerners, invests in the fast-growing East Asian economies like Thailand and Indonesia without allowing the resulting output to threaten domestic producers. Japanese plants in Thailand, for example, don't sell back to Japan, but to the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Critics, however, are using imports and immigrants as scapegoats for broader problems afflicting low-skilled workers. Some economists argue that U.S. industrial workers are far more threatened by robots at home than peasants abroad. \"I don't think what happened to unskilled labor in the 1980s can be attributed to international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with undeveloped countries,\" says Jagdish Bhagwati, economist at Columbia University. \"A great deal of work shows that 95% of the stagnation in wages in the 1980s is attributable to technology.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As technological advances increase productivity and lessen the demand for labor, wage levels for unskilled U.S. workers languish. But outside certain labor-intensive sectors where developing countries have an advantage, the U.S. has attracted foreign investors, some of whom choose the U.S. as a base for the larger <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> market. Mr. Bhagwati's studies show that during the 1980s, more jobs were created by foreign investors in the U.S. than by U.S. companies moving plants to low-wage countries like Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that productivity in the hinterlands of many countries still lags. According to a senior U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official, if Mexico grew as fast as Japan did in the 1960s, it would take 30 years to reach the productivity levels of Italy, which are well below those in the U.S. Similarly, East European productivity is years behind that of its Western neighbors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those fighting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-opening moves \"just look at the narrow, first-order job losses,\" says Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley & Co. economist. \"What they don't point out is that as income levels rise, our developing neighbors look beyond their borders for high-value products.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the running U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> surplus with Mexico, which came to $5.4 billion last year, indicates that so far, Mexico's economic development is mainly creating demand for U.S. goods. Moreover, U.S. wages in export-related jobs run 17% higher than the average manufacturing wage, suggesting that international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is supporting higher-value jobs at home.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>However, both in the U.S. and Europe, the critics of more open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are drowning out the companies and workers that stand to gain. \"In Europe, the gainers from open <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> are a lot of people who make small gains, and the losers, like agriculture and steel, make big losses,\" says Jim Rollo, economist with the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fear-mongers circling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> -- and their counterparts overseas -- should focus on the real problem: namely, workers with low skills in a world economy that demands higher skills and ever-improving productivity. If the U.S. dumps <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and closes its borders to foreign goods tomorrow, that segment of the work force still faces a dismal future. At least with expanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, says Mr. Stein, \"there should be some way to use the net gains to assist those who are injured.\"</p>\n"}

From the industrial giants like Alfa and Vitro, to the midsize companies, right on down to the informal vendors, the costs of doing business in Mexico are increasing while projected earnings are falling. Official growth projections have been downgraded to under 3% for this year compared with projections of 4% made a year ago, and some worry that growth may be dead in the water.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Up until now, there has been little question about the current administration's commitment to strong growth. Since becoming president in 1988, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his economic team have embraced a plethora of supplyside growth initiatives, often in defiance of international \"experts.\" These initiatives included dramatic tax rate cuts, an opening to foreign goods and capital, deregulation of capital markets, massive privatizations and an opening for private investments in economic areas heretofor reserved for the state.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican market responded to these actions like desert flowers in a rainstorm. Private-sector investment bloomed. Capital markets and inflows from abroad surged. Formerly protected businesses learned to compete and found the resources to do so by joining the world financial system. Government revenue from tax receipts doubled, leading to the first budget surplus in Mexican history; and, in an atmosphere of strict monetary discipline, inflation did what all the Phillips-curve-critics of President Salinas's bullish growth strategy said was impossible: It decreased to a projected annual rate of 11% this year from 159% in 1987.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But several months ago, the economy turned wobbly. While officials were boasting in world forums about their budget surplus, Mexican firms were reeling at the enormous cost of capital at home. Lower growth projections increased the possibility that the peso was overvalued. Even the booming stock market became fickle, fluctuating wildly at the slightest indication of bad news at home or abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Of course, Mexico's growth slowdown began in the context of a world recession. But not all of Mexico's slowdown can be attributed to outside factors. The administration, while perhaps not actively suppressing growth, has momentarily made anti-inflationary goals paramount.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Salinas doesn't put it exactly that way. \"We do not believe that you have to sacrifice growth in order to have lower inflation,\" said the president in an interview last month. \"But we are facing today a situation in which you can not sustain high growth due to the international situation. And since we are going through that transition we are taking advantage of that situation precisely to collapse inflation.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is that many firms in Mexico, as well as foreign investors, see Mexico's need to grow as a more immediate concern. \"The number one concern of Mexican businesses is to remain competitive,\" says Alejandro Guzman, president of Monterrey's Coparmex, an industrial chamber. \"And that's not easy to do with the high cost of capital in Mexico now.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not all analysts agree on the cause of Mexico's high cost of capital. Some bankers blame stringent requirements placed on their activities in March by the central bank. Most others blame Finance Minister Pedro Aspe's insistence on running an annual budgetary surplus, currently running at 0.4% of the country's gross national product.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One would expect such restraint more from the Bundesbank than from a Latin government. But what's right for developed Germany may not be right for a developing country like Mexico. Mexico needs to build infrastructure. And as long as the government maintains its commitment to strong growth and a strong currency -- a commitment that could be much enhanced by anchoring the peso to the dollar -- growth bonds could be issued to sustain the needed socioeconomic overhaul. But to do this, Mexico would likely have to give up its precious surplus.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economists David Goldman and Evan Kalimtgis from the New Jersey firm Polyconomics remarked on this in a report they published in September: \"Mexico's position resembles that of a young family which must mortgage future earnings potential in order to purchase a home. . . . A young economy, like a young individual, does not have a sufficient wealth buffer to sustain a drop in earnings.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Aspe appreciates the sentiment, but rejects the advice: \"If you were to ask me, `Pedro, structurally, for a country like Mexico, what would be the right policy?' I'd answer straight: a fixed exchange rate with a small fiscal deficit of between 0% and 2%. But we have not reached that level because: first, inflation is still very high; and second, because <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't been passed. When these two things are locked up, then we can follow a more aggressive growth strategy.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One can well understand the Mexican government's concern about inflation and the passage of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. But are these goals really jeopardized by a more adventuresome commitment to stronger growth? In fact, the greatest threat to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> may well be slow growth. If exporters to Mexico, or potential joint venture partners, or even those speculative investors who view all of Mexico as a growth stock, perceive that Mexico is not doggedly committed to growth, their interest in the treaty will diminish.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As for inflationary pressures in the economy, it's difficult to spot many rising consumer prices. Nevertheless, from the high cost of capital, land and managerial labor to the tremendously complex tax and regulatory codes, production costs in Mexico are as high as ever. \"If you take a Mexican company in the manufacturing industry with the same cost structure as a U.S. company, the tax burden for the Mexican company is substantially higher,\" says Desc's Mr. Medina-Mora. And since Mexican trading doors were opened, Mexican producers can't pass their costs on to a captive consumer; that consumer can now buy foreign. This cuts entrepreneurs' enthusiasm about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican firms are not looking for an artificial boost through an arbitrary lowering of interest rates or a devaluation of the currency. \"Most of us generally support the macro policies of the government,\" says Monterrey steel company owner Eduardo Garza. \"But it still takes months to start up a business in Mexico today. Many entrepreneurs simply give up in frustration or operate in the underground economy. The government must push harder to deregulate the economy and get rid of all the disincentives.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In this area, help may be on its way. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> minister Jaime Serra recently announced a 12-point program of fiscal and regulatory incentives to boost the supply side of the Mexican economy. These changes compliment others that have been on line for several months, including: elimination of capital gains taxes for the transfer of properties; the ability to fully deduct in the first year all the present discounted value of an investment (excluding Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey); an overhaul of Mexico's antiquated port facilities; and hints that Mexico's strangulating labor laws (which hamper the flexibiilty of both workers and managers) may be overhauled as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the slowdown, Mexico still seems like a coiled spring ready to pop at 5% to 10% growth a year. President Salinas admits that \"we are capable of sustaining rates of 6% in real terms per year.\" But the longer the government keeps the spring coiled, the greater the chance that it loses its elasticity. The Mexican government has to take larger steps to prove to the U.S. and to its own people that it is seriously committed to releasing the juggernaut. If not, precisely those indicators that Mr. Aspe is waiting for -- passage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and an inflation rate competitive with the U.S. -- may slip from its grasp.    ---    Mr. Asman edits the Americas column.</p>\n"}

Only a few weeks ago the landmark General Agreement on Tariffs and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> (GATT) looked like a gimme putt in Congress. But a lack of White House attention has let the tariff-cutting pact drift into jeopardy for this year, and maybe forever if Mr. Clinton doesn't spend some political capital.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm very concerned,\" says GOP Rep.

Ross Perot is sitting out this fight, at least so far, while unions are applying most of their muscle to labor law and health care. Those intellectual comrades, Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, are lobbing sound bites but sway few votes. Even Dick Gephardt, the Democrats' ranking <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> warrior, has suggested he'll support GATT.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Maybe that's why Mr. Gingrich's rebellion caught the White House napping. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> he was Mr. Clinton's savior, delivering 132 GOP votes (to just 102 Democrats). But Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" the de facto House Republican leader raised the specter of lost U.S. sovereignty under GATT. He fretted about the pact's provision for a new World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization (WTO), in which the U.S. \"could be outvoted by Antigua, by Botswana or by Venezuela,\" among other nemeses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm for world <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>,\" said the Georgia bulldog, \"but I'm against world government.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Gingrich didn't say was that five days earlier he'd heard a similar spiel from Roger Milliken, the legendary textile protectionist, and Pat Choate, Mr. Perot's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> guru. On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, Mr. Gingrich had broken with Mr. Milliken, who has been a financial supporter of the Georgian's political causes. Has the House's leading Republican gone for a swim in the fever swamps?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Cobb, the GOP economist who's studied the GATT text, says yes, because the WTO is no threat to American self-rule. \"It's quite silly,\" he says. \"The WTO has no executive authority; it's a mechanism for settling <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> disputes. The argument is a red herring.\" Mr. Cobb works for that famous one-world conspiracy front, the Heritage Foundation. He says he'd shutter both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund if he could, but the WTO is different.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The WTO does have stronger enforcement powers than in the past. But that's exactly what the U.S. sought during seven years of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> talks, so that protectionists would have to abide by sterner global rules. Mr. Gingrich rightly says that power will always trump rules, but the U.S. remains the biggest trading power in the world. Are Botswana and Antigua, to pick just two mortal threats, going to endanger the U.S. with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> reprisals? In any case, say advocates, any substantive change in WTO rules couldn't apply to the U.S. unless Congress agreed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where Mr. Gingrich has a better point is in mistrusting White House instincts on such matters. At the GATT signing two weeks ago in Morocco, Vice President Gore sounded his one-world weirdest. The Americans shot down in Iraq \"died in the service of the United Nations,\" he said by way of offering patriotic condolences.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That remark raised hackles in a GOP cloakroom already alarmed by the subordination of U.S. policy to the U.N. in Bosnia. Mr. Gore also waxed lyrical about how the WTO will spur \"global dialogue,\" or worse, on world labor and environmental controls.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reality, most of the world is more afraid of this Gore agenda than is even Mr. Gingrich, so none of it is going to happen. But someone might tell the veep that his rhetoric only gives red meat to Republicans who want an excuse to oppose GATT. The Clinton administration seems to be making the same mistake it did on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, which is to court votes on the left that it probably can't get anyway, while ignoring votes on the right that it needs to prevail.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Clinton White House seems unable to sustain a centrist, bipartisan coalition even when it's in its own interests. Instead it always builds from the left first. Many House Republicans remember that Mr. Clinton didn't even single them out for thanks after their votes last time. So perhaps Mr. Gingrich is just issuing a warning to the president not to take GOP votes for granted this time.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's no reason to go further and scuttle a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact that amounts to one of the largest tariff cuts in world history. A tariff cut is really a tax cut, which is what Republicans are supposed to favor. Mr. Gingrich might even use his leverage to insist that these tariff/tax cuts will so boost <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> that they'll produce more, not less, tariff revenue for the government (and thus require no offsetting tax hikes). Maybe Mr. Clinton will agree and christen it the Gingrich Curve -- a good precedent for the next tax debate.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398519032.xml", "text": "<h2>The Americas: Flexible exchange rates will best serve Nafta</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No one could argue that the three currencies of North America, two dollars and one peso, make a neat arrangement. Canada's dollar floats. The Mexican peso was propelled by the late 1994 currency crisis from a rate pegged to the U.S. dollar into a float even less predictable than that of Canada. The U.S. dollar? Well, it floats too in North America, since the other two currencies float around it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This situation strikes quite a few commentators as unsatisfactory, whether seen from a strictly national point of view or more broadly as a currency arrangement for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. They would like more fixity as a means of fostering <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and reducing financial uncertainty. But as currency set-ups go, the existing one is realistic in relation to underlying circumstances. With sound domestic financial policies, it is very satisfactory because it helps national economic adjustment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The argument for fixing rates in aid of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> requires critical examination. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is only what its name says it is -- a free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement. It isn't even as much as a customs union, where the partners have unified tariffs for items originating outside the zone. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners are free to negotiate separate tariffs with other nations. In particular, the U.S. clearly will continue to tackle some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> (and other) issues on its own.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still less is <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a common market, where the free flow of labor as well as capital across national borders is permitted, and where competition codes are harmonized by supranational legislation -- the Single European Act, for example. This is the context in which countries in Europe now envisage monetary union in 1999 via the Maastricht Treaty.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whether Europe needs a single currency and therefore a single central bank, with all that this implies, to go with its developing common market continues to be debated by economists. It remains subject to political debate as well, especially in the U.K. However, the point here is that this debate takes place against a scenario of far more economic and political integration than has been dreamed of in North America. Indeed, to point up the contrast, part of the U.S. rationale for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was to provide Mexico with economic opportunities that would curb the migration of labor to the U.S. from Mexico. A common market would imply the reverse, a free flow of labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The difference between <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the EU supports the economic case for exchange rate flexibility in North America. Economic disturbances specific to Mexico or Canada do occur quite often. Exchange rate flexibility is helpful in coping with them. And the case for such flexibility is strengthened when workers themselves cannot adjust by moving freely across North American borders. Furthermore, there are no cross-border budgetary transfers to cushion such disturbances.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In any event, what could a monetary union mean in North America? In Europe it means pooling sovereignty among countries of reasonably equal size that would have balanced voting in the proposed common central bank. This is a nonstarter in North America. Canada and Mexico no doubt could use the U.S. dollar as legal tender if they wished. But this would not really be monetary union. Rather it would be official dollarization, with \"official\" only applying to one side.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The other side, the U.S., would surely look kindly on the use of its currency by close trading partners. It might even return to its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners some of the seigniorage proceeds it would obtain through such use. What it could not be expected to do, however, is adapt its monetary policies to circumstances for the continent as a whole, as opposed to those for the U.S., or undertake to support banks outside its jurisdiction, even if those banks were funding themselves in U.S. dollars.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So clearly monetary union North American-style has institutional drawbacks. Even to try it, Mexico and Canada would need to have available the U.S. dollars to distribute in place of their own currencies. Canada could just about do that with the reserves it has, but Mexico is short. And to provide a backstop for the national banking system, each country would need either to hold additional U.S. dollars as a liquidity reserve fund or to have a reliable source from which to borrow them at short notice.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fixing the exchange rate through a currency board scheme raises similar issues of financing. Argentina showed this in 1995 when it had to use IMF and World Bank funds to stave off a bank run. A more important consideration is that a currency board is a less intense commitment, because the government, rather than the general public, keeps hold of the U.S. dollars that support it. It is therefore less credible in principle than a monetary union. A pegged, or fixed-but-adjustable, rate is far less credible still, as Mexico's recent experience demonstrated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credibility is crucial. From this angle Canada could more readily establish a convincing fixed-rate arrangement than could Mexico, because its financial performance and economic structure are closer to U.S. patterns. But by the same token, for Canada the supposed credibility benefits of fixing would be less. Canadian inflation has been running below the U.S. pace for several years and Canadian interest rates, at least at the shorter end, are already lower than those in the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The U.S. might believe that fixity would avoid competitive currency depreciations by close trading partners. But in any case, a policy of competitive depreciation is not sustainable, and would not be in the national economic interest of Mexico or Canada either. In particular, such a misguided policy leads to inflation and high interest rates.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But to make clear that the exchange rate is not an instrument of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy is far from saying that it doesn't matter -- for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> or for the economy as a whole. And it is of course legitimate for monetary policy in both Canada and Mexico to concern itself with the exchange rate as well as with interest rates. For Canada the present low currency value reflects easier monetary conditions in a context of modest inflation and slow demand. For Mexico matters are more complicated, given the recent blow to confidence, the resulting high interest rates, and high residual inflation. But no one can doubt that demand overall in Mexico is weak, reducing inflationary pressure.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Canada has worked hard to establish a sound currency domestically, in its own economic interest. This effort also provides a solid foundation for a flexible Canadian dollar. The Bank of Mexico -- Mexico's central bank -- has further to go, but it is aiming in the same direction. As it moves further along that path, a floating peso will work better than it does now, because it will be operating against a background of domestic financial confidence.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Crow is a senior adviser to the American International Group and was formerly governor of the Bank of Canada.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398535615.xml", "text": "<h2>The last straw</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's easy to sympathize with the oft-heard complaint of Latin Americans that the U.S. is interested in free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> only so long as it is Americans who benefit. Just consider Washington's latest <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dispute with Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Earlier this month, the Administration increased to 33% from 22% the tariff on imports of ordinary straw brooms from Mexico, citing the Emergency Action Chapter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This decision is yet another indication -- add it to U.S. protectionism against Mexican tomatoes, avocados and trucking -- that the spirit of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is perennially at risk due to the power of special interest groups. In this case, the U.S. Cornbroom Task Force, an industry group, argued that the tiny Mexican corn broom industry was injuring the even tinier U.S. corn broom industry -- even though broomcorn, a kind of sorghum, apparently isn't profitable enough to be grown in this country anymore. American broom makers import it from -- guess where? -- Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico exports only about $7 million in corn brooms to the U.S. each year, which made it tough for the large broom industry here to argue that it had suffered an injury. In order to get around this inconvenient fact, the U.S. broom industry, which makes both plastic and corn brooms, argued that corn brooms are a separate industry from plastic brooms. Since U.S. broom makers have moved heavily toward plastic in recent years, a snapshot of the corn broom segment of the market produces the image of a Mexican corn broom industry of 2,500 workers swallowing up a small, shrinking industry of 600 American workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cause of the American corn broom makers is helped by language in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> specifying that tariffs can be restored if American broom makers suffer. This was engineered by Democratic Rep. Glenn Poshard of Illinois, home of Arcola, the self-styled \"Broomcorn Capital of the World,\" where no broomcorn has grown for 20 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mexican corn broom industry is centered mostly in a poor region of the state of Nuevo Leon not far from the U.S. border. While the U.S. frets about Mexican job-seekers sneaking into California and Texas, lends billions of dollars in emergency funding to Mexico, and supports a variety of aid agencies whose objective is to end poverty there, it is ironic that it also suffocates competitive local businesses that wish to sell their wares in the U.S. With this ruling, Mexican producers will have less opportunity and U.S. consumers will pay more for brooms.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, once a proud peacock representing the future of freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> on this continent, is slowly having its plumes plucked. The concept of comparative advantage -- the heart and soul of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> theory -- appears to be completely lost on the managed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>rs in Washington. Every time it looks like a Mexican industry might have an edge over its U.S. counterpart, Washington cries foul and finds a way to up the tariff and save an antiquated industry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The broom tariff was the last straw for Mexico. After battling for many months against U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies that boosted the price of Mexican tomatoes, blocked the export of avocados and kept Mexican trucks from crossing the border, Mexico sent a message to Washington earlier this month that it had had enough. It boosted tariffs on eight U.S. products, including notebooks, wine coolers, brandy and Tennessee whiskey.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Economically speaking, retaliation doesn't make sense -- Mexicans don't win if children have to pay a premium for notebooks or grownups shell out more for a cocktail. Yet it's an indication of just how frustrated our southern neighbor is. Instead of bullying our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partner, the U.S. should lead the way in free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, thereby helping U.S. consumers, Mexican workers and, yes, American workers as well. It's true that some corn broom makers may be forced to seek other work, but in the long run it is to the advantage of the U.S. to produce things for which it has a comparative advantage. Wrapping wire around straw is not where the future of the American economy lies.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398547163.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA offers Latins little they can't have now</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once again the U.S. is flirting with its Latin American trading partners. Last week President Clinton began efforts to win fast-track negotiating authority in Congress, no doubt raising hopes that expansion of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement is in the wings. The trouble is that the administration's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy toward Latin America is highly political and actually harms the cause of freer <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the effects of the 1994 Miami Summit. By insinuating, suggesting and some would even say, promising that the U.S. would lead efforts to build a Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas, the administration created an almost complete paralysis among Latin American <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy makers. All around the region, plans to reduce import restrictions further have been shelved and programs to eliminate nontariff barriers postponed as the Latin American countries wait to see if (and when) they would be invited to join the great \"regional integration\" ball.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Worse yet, in many countries two misguided notions have taken hold. First, that maintaining protection at home would enhance these countries' negotiating position with the U.S., and second, that by forming regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> blocs -- irrespective of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> diversion they may generate -- the grand goal of achieving hemispheric integration would, in the end, be advanced.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even pragmatic Chilean policy makers fell into the trap, and became obsessed with joining the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. This in spite of the fact that analysts have been unable to show persuasively that, when compared with other options, joining <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would most benefit the country. And while they waited, they did nothing to further open their economy to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After a series of snubs by the Clinton administration and Congress, however, Chile has recently decided to retake the road that had served the country so well in the past: unilaterally reducing its tariffs. This is a welcome announcement. By further integrating itself into the rest of the world -- import tariffs are supposed to be reduced to 7% in 1997 -- Chile will encourage productivity enhancements and will allow local producers greater access to world technology and capital goods.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, backtracking on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization in the rest of Latin America continues and is best demonstrated by Brazil's recent decision to severely limit import financing. Brazil's partners in the Mercosur customs union -- Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -- have bitterly complained that this unilateral turn toward protectionism violates the spirit, as well as the letter, of that regional accord. This is a move toward greater protectionism and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the benefits and possibilities available to Brazil -- if it would only continue to open its economy to the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In spite of tremendous progress in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization during the first half of the 1990s, politicians in a number of countries in the region have begun to question the merits of additional opening. In many countries import restrictions have been raised in response to an array of pressures by special interest groups. The recent hike in import tariffs in Colombia, the increase in protectionism in Venezuela and Ecuador, and the use of administrative measures to control imports in Argentina and Mexico are all signs of this trend. Ironically these moves are taking place at a time when the Latin American countries should move aggressively, rapidly and unilaterally toward greater openness.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many observers of Latin America believe that the region is already very open to the rest of the world. This is simply not true. In most Latin American nations import tariffs border on 15%. Although this is historically low for the region, it is still very high from an global perspective -- the average U.S. import tariff, for example, is approximately 3%. And most Latin American countries still have significant nontariff barriers. Latin America's relatively high levels of import protectionism have been recognized by some analysts, including Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy of the Heritage Foundation. In their \"The Index of Economic Freedom\" (co-published by this newspaper), not a single Latin American nation is classified as having a \"very low level\" of protectionism, and only a handful are rated as having a \"low level\" of protectionism.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What's more alarming is that the progress that has been made in bringing down some <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers in Latin America -- and indeed the trend toward greater <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization -- is now at risk.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Aside from special-interest politics, two factors have caused this shift in sentiment. First, there is still an important disagreement on whether \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization\" packages have played an important role in the performance of the \"miracle\" economies of East Asia. Some academics, for example, have questioned the premise that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization is a necessary component of successful outward-oriented strategies, and have argued that the Asian Tigers' success has to a large extent depended on an active government role in promoting exports. Existing empirical evidence on the relationship between openness and growth is weak and unpersuasive, these observers allege. Second, in the last few years concern has grown that developing countries' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization may worsen income inequality and social conditions -- particularly hurting unskilled workers. These concerns, however, are largely unfounded.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recent empirical research based on extensive new comparative data strongly suggests that countries whose economies become more integrated to the rest of the world experience an important boost in productivity growth. Moreover, mounting international evidence suggests that if labor markets are flexible and undistorted -- a requirement not met at this point by most Latin American countries -- major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization reforms will not generate transitional increases in unemployment, as many have feared.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, a recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank has found that the lack of progress in many Latin American countries on income distribution and other social conditions cannot be attributed to their reform programs, including <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization. This confirms previous OECD research suggesting that protectionism may actually increase income inequality in developing nations and that further integration into the world economy will improve social conditions in these countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Other countries in the region would do well to follow Chile's lead. By unilaterally opening to the rest of the world, instead of restricting themselves to a small clique of neighbors, the countries of Latin America will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the global economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards is a professor of international business at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management.</p>\n"}
{"id": "398955105.xml", "text": "<h2>Business World: Tree Growin' Man</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Chuck Leavell considers it \"pitiful\" that only 0.06% of farm spending is devoted to subsidizing private forestry.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One responsibility of a columnist is to listen to rock'n'rollers who want to share their views on farm policy. Mr. Leavell has been playing piano for the Rolling Stones for 24 years. In his other life, he operates a private forestry plantation near Macon, Ga., and by a magic chemistry of his twin professions, has become a top spokesman and lobbyist for the nation's thousands of private forest owners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He doesn't kid himself. Mr. Leavell knows that journalists and the countless audiences he addresses sit still for the tree lecture partly because he rubs shoulders with Mick and Keith. Or, if they are music fans of a certain antiquity, because of his piano work on a true national heirloom, the Allman Brothers instrumental \"Jessica.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He joined the band in 1972, just 20 years old, when the group was putting itself back together after Duane Allman's fatal motorcycle crash. \"I was thinking about how I'd establish my instrument in the band,\" recalls Mr. Leavell. That's when the band's surviving guitarist, Dickey Betts, came through the studio door with a new tune penned while listening to Django Reinhardt records with his baby daughter, Jessica.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But enough of the history of classic rock, volume one. Mr. Leavell wants to talk trees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Peel away the glamour and higher-risk activities than even most baby boomers managed in their youth, and Mr. Leavell turns out to have much in common with the rest of the tribe.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With hard work and luck, he secured his little piece of heaven. But paradise comes with headaches. At 53, he finds himself worrying about taxes, regulation, foreign competition and how to pass to their children what he and his wife, Rose Lane Leavell, have built.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1981, the couple inherited 1,200 rural acres from Rose Lane's grandmother. The first challenge was how to pay the estate taxes. With much gnashing of teeth, they sold a parcel of land that had been in her family for 100 years for a down payment to the IRS, spending the next 15 years paying off the balance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Challenge two was how to make the land productive without Mr. Leavell having to give up touring to tend crops or cattle. Answer: Plant trees.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As time went on, the couple enlarged the property by purchasing more land. They added nature trails for school kids. They added a hunting lodge, with Mr. Leavell himself, when he's in town, leading paying clients in pursuit of quail. He's written three books, including a new children's book, \"The Tree Farmer.\" But, for the time being, his Rolling Stones income must still help meet the plantation's expenses.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When buttonholing the opinion vanguard, two of Mr. Leavell's hobby horses are taxes and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. As development drives up land values and property taxes, timber has become increasingly uneconomic. The problem is compounded by a flood of cheap lumber culled from Canada's endless public forests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Leavell is steeped in both sides of this long and nasty <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> dispute because, before each tour, the Stones spend several weeks rehearsing in Toronto. \"They cry <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. We say level playing field.\" There's only one solution, he says: \"I'm not a big fan of subsidies, but when you're facing Canada, which does nothing but subsidize its timber, you gotta play the game.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He offers plenty of good environmental reasons why private forest owners should be coddled as a matter of public policy. Trees scrub carbon dioxide from the air, help purify the water, provide habitat for birds and critters, etc.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here Mr. Leavell, a man of gentle and courtly demeanor, is engaged in what inevitably must be characterized as special pleading. I explain to him that the Journal editorial page has long been in favor of eliminating farm subsidies, not spreading them to new classes of landowners. And while trees yield public benefits, they also yield Mr. Leavell a great deal of private satisfaction, for which some taxpayers might feel perfectly comfortable letting him pick up the whole tab.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But let's not be too dogmatic. Lobbying is a great and necessary privilege in a free society. As Mr. Leavell has been known to tell audiences, our elected leaders work for us, we don't work for them, and it's entirely proper for citizens to convey their needs and interests to their elected representatives.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nor does he seem primarily concerned with his own interests. After all, he's got the musical income to subsidize his rural activities. But he does seem to take quite seriously his role as spokesman for thousands of landowners who, beset by sprawl and rising taxes, are forced to sell family forest land to developers that they'd rather keep as woody habitat for wildlife.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>White-bearded, trim and dapper, Mr. Leavell has a second job for the Stones as the band's unofficial musical director, coaching the gang through a repertoire that changes each night. A high school dropout from deepest Alabama, was he surprised to discover he had a knack for management? He nods his head: \"Especially public speaking. To stand up and give my views in public -- that's something I never would have considered. Now I love it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Meanwhile, his bemused bandmates have become accepting of the inevitability of a certain amount of tree talk on tour. Put it down to transatlantic cultural exchange: With his missionary enthusiasm and passion for self-improvement, Mr. Leavell exhibits what many would call the best features of the American character.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Tree Farmers Face Loss Of Crops From Katrina\" -- WSJ Feb. 9, 2006)</p>\n"}
{"id": "398998596.xml", "text": "<h2>Cross Country: Union Man</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Raleigh, N.C. -- Presidential hopeful John Edwards is fond of telling us that he's the son of a mill worker. And, although he now lives in a mansion and sports expensive haircuts, he also has another thing in common with some wage earners. He's betting his future employment on the power of organized labor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But is this a safe bet? In Tar Heel, N.C., where organized labor is trying to unionize the largest meat processing plant in the world, that is a pressing question. And it's one that even Paula Deen, a popular host of a down-home cooking show on Food Network, may have to answer.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Smithfield Foods slaughters more than 30,000 hogs a day in Tar Heel, employs some 5,500 people and pays competitive wages -- especially for the rural South. But the United Food and Commercial Workers union wants to organize the plant anyway, arguing that it will protect workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far Smithfield workers aren't going along. They have voted against forming a union, twice, and would likely do so again if another secret ballot election is held.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Undeterred, union supporters have protested at one of Ms. Deen's book signings demanding that she cut ties to Smithfield. The union also wants to dispense with elections and unionize the plant through a controversial process called \"card check\" -- which merely requires gathering signatures from a majority of workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is where Mr. Edwards enters the fray. He supports the union in its fight against Smithfield and he supports legislation under consideration in Congress that would make it easier to use the card check instead of an election. Mr. Edwards also recently sent a letter to Smithfield CEO Larry Pope demanding that he \"protect the right of workers\" to bargain collectively. He wants Mr. Pope to support the card check.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This -- his support for dispensing with secret ballot elections in the name of workers' rights -- makes Mr. Edwards one of the most pro- union presidential candidates in a long time. And it is a departure from who he was when he was elected to the Senate in 1998 as a Southern centrist. That reputation led then-Vice President Al Gore to consider tapping him as a running mate in 2000, and it was one reason why John Kerry put him on the ticket in 2004.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past three years, Mr. Edwards has moved sharply to the left. Indeed, he has lashed himself to the mast of organized labor and steered hard to port. His bet is that service-worker unions will propel him to a surprise victory in the early Nevada presidential caucus, giving him a shot at beating the better-financed campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He also feels that he has found an underserved constituency -- people displaced by the New Economy. And he is on to something. Outside of edge cities and burgeoning metro areas, the painful churning in the economy is easy to spot. Think boarded-up textile mills.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, this isn't the image North Carolina has as a prototypical New South state. The banking capital of Charlotte and the knowledge- worker Mecca of the Research Triangle are more familiar symbols. But North Carolina used to have one of the nation's highest rates of employment and economic production in manufacturing, which offered good pay and stable employment for people with relatively little education.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over the past decade, however, there was a big change. Manufacturing made up just 22% of North Carolina's gross state product in 2005, down from 30% in 1997. Nationally, manufacturing's share of economic output only fell half as much (from 18% to 14%) during that time. Notwithstanding solid growth in Charlotte and other areas, North Carolina has trailed the nation in most measures of economic performance since the mid-1990s. Many North Carolinians still work in small industrial cities and rural counties, but, for the most part, they've had to be retrained at great effort and haven't yet replaced their former incomes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recognizing public trepidation about these events, Mr. Edwards and the labor movement lay blame on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, other free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pacts and the decline of unionization. But international <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> didn't start with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, nor did the downward trend in manufacturing. Many textile executives in this state even supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, hoping to join with lower-cost factories south of the border and thereby compete with Asia producers. The problem is that the Chinese -- and others -- are now making better quality products than they used to. American consumers are getting more for their money.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The union response has been to push for higher wages and to oppose moving or laying off workers. That has made it harder to keep manufacturing jobs. Consider the textile giant Pillowtex, which was once a fixture in Cabarrus County under the name Fieldcrest Cannon. In the late 1990s it was unionized by the Union of Needle<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>s, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). In 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy and sought partners to complete a turnaround and keep at least some of its domestic production. One was Springs Industries in South Carolina. But UNITE helped scuttle the Springs deal in April 2003, fearing the loss of its newly won foothold at Pillowtex. A few months later Pillowtex closed its Cabarrus County mill, leaving the union nothing left to stand on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It turns out that exercising political power through a union isn't a substitute for innovation, retraining and other steps necessary to make economies competitive. Look at the numbers. From 1997 to 2005 the 10 states with the highest rates of union membership -- which include California, New York and Michigan, among others -- had slower growth than the bottom 10 states. North Carolina is among just five states with union membership rates below 5%. But it also has a predilection for raising taxes -- the Tax Foundation estimated this year it that it has the 19th heaviest tax burden in the country, up from 36th in 2000. Further unionizing the workforce will likely only make the state look more like the old Northeast and Rustbelt than the New South.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Mr. Edwards urges private-sector unionization as the best way to protect middle class jobs, he can only hope that unions are better at fulfilling electoral promises than economic ones.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation, is the author of \"Selling the Dream\" (Praeger Publishers, 2005).</p>\n"}
{"id": "409546270.xml", "text": "<h2>Bending on Steel</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The distance the current Democratic presidential contenders have strayed from the Clinton formula for winning the White House became startlingly clear last week with their reaction to President Bush's decision to remove the tariffs on imported steel that he had imposed 21 months before.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democrats had a free shot at Bush for inconsistency, and most of them took it. But every e-mailed comment I saw from them said or implied that they would not have responded as Bush did when the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization ruled that the tariffs were unjustified and European nations threatened to slap $2.2 billion of retaliatory levies on U.S. products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The party whose last president fought against protectionism and for international agreements to liberalize <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> has moved a long way in the other direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For some of the candidates, this was a no-brainer. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri opposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and the normalization of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with China during the time Bill Clinton was president -- a stand that has earned him support from most of the major industrial unions this year. His comment that \"the president's action today demonstrates a callous disregard for the workers and the communities whose jobs and livelihoods have been decimated by unfair competition\" was entirely predictable.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So was the similar blast from Rep. Dennis Kucinich. His home state of Ohio is a major steel producer, and many thought that Bush's original decision to impose stiff tariffs on foreign steel was a bid to strengthen his reelection hand precisely in such steelmaking states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But consider Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a consistent supporter of liberal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies throughout his career and a backer of the major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements. Rather than reiterate those beliefs, he said: \"We need a manufacturing plan with a spine of steel to promote American businesses and workers, not a manufactured plan that bends with every gust of wind.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who has been steadily tacking away from his earlier support of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> as he tries to head off Gephardt in Iowa, went further than Lieberman. \"The president's decision to lift the steel tariffs early is just another example of this administration playing politics with people's lives,\" Dean said. \"When he imposed the tariffs, the president's rhetoric suggested that he actually cared about American steelworkers, their families and the communities in which they live. If that were the case, he would not be lifting them today.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Within days after this bow to protectionism, Dean was endorsed by former vice president Al Gore, the same man who had defended <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in a notable debate with Ross Perot -- another sign of the seismic shift among Democrats on this issue.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the most interesting case is retired Gen. Wesley Clark. He is the favorite of many Clintonians, including Mickey Kantor, a key operative in Clinton's 1992 campaign and later his top <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> official. Just a few weeks ago, I attended a news conference where Kantor joined two others who had served as special <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> representative in Republican administrations, Carla Hills and Clayton Yeutter, in urging the Bush administration to take bolder steps to eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers. Kantor said specifically that while he thought at the time the steel tariffs were imposed that they were justified, it was imperative that they be lifted now -- as Bush subsequently did.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But Clark obviously did not consult Kantor, a senior adviser, on this question. In a most peculiar fashion, Clark first issued a statement that accused Bush of \"taking his cues\" from \"steel industry executives\" he had been with \"at a fundraiser in Pittsburgh.\" That made no sense, because the steel executives wanted the tariffs to remain in effect. So, 26 minutes later, came a correction from Clark's Little Rock headquarters, eliminating the bogus charge and complaining that Bush \"still has no strategy to help the 2.6 million manufacturing workers who have lost their jobs.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those job losses are real and have been underway for years. The Bush White House, with its politically driven and inconsistent actions, in effect has confessed that it has no answers to the problem. The Democrats are more than eager to exploit the situation and offer, with varying degrees of conviction and coherence, formulas they claim will help revive the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What is being lost in the debate is the conviction that led Clinton -- and his Republican predecessors -- to place the United States on the side of reducing <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and expanding international markets. This issue is a lot more serious than either party's approach to it would ever let you know.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>davidbroder@washpost.com</p>\n"}
{"id": "409555271.xml", "text": "<h2>The Doctor Factor</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At long last, the revelation I've been waiting for: the reason why -- beyond the prospect of epic, McGovernesque defeat -- I feel so uneasy about Howard Dean.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The man is a doctor. This is the least-examined chapter of his career. But suddenly it all makes sense: Where else but in medicine do you find men and women who never admit a mistake? Who talk more than they listen, and feel entitled to withhold crucial information? Whose lack of tact in matters of life and death might disqualify them for any other field?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it happens, I've spent almost two decades observing politicians, whom on balance I quite like, and more recent years observing doctors, who . . . . Well, let's just say that mine is a grudge tenderly nurtured over two and a half years of illness, encompassing roughly 32 doctors in six hospitals, plus scores of the medical students, fellows, interns and residents in whom we can see the doctor in larval form.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A doctor who has told you one thing at Appointment A might propose an entirely different course of action at Meeting B. Fair enough -- except for the pretense that nothing has changed. It is the very rare doctor who will say, \"I've changed my mind,\" or, \"Sorry, I was wrong when I said X at our last meeting.\" Usually, what he said last time has simply become . . . inoperative.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now let's turn the clock back to September, and watch Dean answer George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" about his 180-degree turn, over the years, on the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement:</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GS: \"On <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, you used to be a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HD: \"George, you're doing it again. I supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and wrote a letter to President Clinton in 1992 supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. That's different than 'you used to be a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.' \"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GS: \"You were a strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HD: \"I supported <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Where do you get this 'I'm a strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'? I didn't do anything about it. I didn't vote on it. I didn't march down the street demanding <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. I simply wrote a letter supporting <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Dean was not in the least abashed that he had described himself on the same show, eight years earlier, as \"a very strong supporter of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Now, we patients rarely dare to have such pugnacious dialogue with our doctors. George Stephanopoulos doesn't have to wear one of those demoralizing gowns with all the confusing snaps, and if you're sick you have more important things to do during your tiny portions of face time than bicker with your doctor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(A disclaimer: Naturally, all the doctors who are presently  treating and advising me are paragons of sagacity and compassion, nothing at all like the men and women I am so broadly lampooning. You know who you are.) The odd thing is that most of Dean's unacknowledged shifts in position are of the kind any other half- good politician, with some vaporous wording, could explain away in his sleep. But even when Dean makes what is clearly a blunder, it takes him days to make the apology that a rival campaign would instinctively produce before the next news cycle.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Which brings me to the irrationally strong impulse, shared by doctors and politicians, to hoard information. Consider the high- handed way Dean has tried to shield great portions of his gubernatorial records. Similarly, doctors seem bent on ensuring that you not read the runic scribblings they have made in your chart. During one hospital stay, as I sat in a wheelchair outside Radiology waiting to be pushed back to my room, I began idly flipping through my chart. A young female doctor-in-training I had never seen before stopped in front of me and said, \"You know, you really shouldn't be reading your chart.\" I thanked her for her advice and continued reading. She repeated her admonition. I explained that I was 43 and couldn't possibly read anything worse there than I had already been told by five real doctors. Upon which she actually wrested it from my grasp. (From this I learned always to go to a stall in the ladies' room when I want to read my chart.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Finally, let's turn to what newspapers delicately title \"the temperament question.\" Dean's been called arrogant, angry, condescending, prickly. He has gotten this far by playing his chesty irritability as a sign of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I have enough brusque, irritable doctors in my life without sending one to the White House. My most memorable brushes have been with an eminent surgeon whose method is to stride into the examining room two hours late, pat your hand, pronounce your certain death if he can't perform an operation on you, and then snap at your husband to stop taking notes, he can't possibly follow the complexity of the doctor's thinking. Dr. X swats away questions like flies. He spends five precious minutes swearing at the wall-mounted phone, which decades of surgical experience have not equipped him to operate, and then finally pronounces that he can't perform the surgery. \"Unless you want me to. But there's a 50-50 chance I would kill you.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why is it, I ask my husband on the way home, that I'm the one who's sick, but they're the ones who are allowed to have the big, operatic personalities?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I have the same concern about Dean. Why should Democrats choose to stand around all spring and summer holding their breath against the moment when Dean says something arrogant or impolitic? (Think Southern guys with Confederate flag decals on their pickup trucks.) We're the ones who are supposed to be allowed to go on with our temperamental little lives, while our major-party nominees are the poor chumps who have agreed to adhere to the rigid, Ken-doll theater of politics.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And so I bring to my assessment of this year's Democratic candidates one requirement that never crossed my mind before. First, do no harm.</p>\n"}
{"id": "409900949.xml", "text": "<h2>Globalization's Deficit</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>FIFTEEN YEARS ago it was fashionable to pronounce the eclipse of the nation-state. In a globalized world, power would flow to supranational bodies: to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and the European Commission, and even to a United Nations freed from the paralyzing divisions of the Cold War. Today this trend appears exhausted. Supranational institutions are not exactly retreating, but they have run out of forward momentum.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Start with economic institutions. The latest round of tariff- cutting talks under the auspices of the WTO is stalling, not because countries oppose <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but because they do not want to make concessions in this multilateral forum. Ambitions to deepen the WTO's power to settle disputes beyond <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> into labor and environmental issues have (fortunately) fizzled, while WTO rulings against protectionist European food regulation or American cotton subsidies don't (unfortunately) cause those policies to be reformed quickly. The same story holds for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. In the 1990s there was talk of building <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> tribunals on labor and the environment into influential voices. It hasn't happened.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The International Monetary Fund is even more diminished. In the 1980s and 1990s, it had a place at the top table, leading the charge for economic reform in developing countries during the years of the debt crisis, then struggling to manage financial crises from East Asia to Russia to Latin America from 1997 to 2001. But now the East Asians have built up financial reserves, partly to withstand future financial shocks without the IMF's assistance. Russia is high on petrodollars. And Brazil and Argentina recently paid off the IMF early in a gesture of independence. The world still faces big international financial issues, from the vast U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit to China's currency manipulation, but the IMF has chosen to duck them. Meanwhile, the World Bank is struggling to define its role in a world awash with private lenders. Its new leader, Paul D. Wolfowitz, wielded power confidently when he was part of the Bush administration, but he is feeling his way along in his new job.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Political institutions are in no better shape. Because of the rise of China and other big middle-income countries, the annual Group of Eight summits have lost their old claim to represent the world's key players; now that Russia has assumed the G-8 presidency, the forum's credibility has shrunk further still. Far from being reinvigorated by the end of the Cold War, the United Nations is in crisis: It is unable to respond decisively even to extreme moral affronts such as the Darfur genocide. It is tarnished by the oil- for-food scandal. And a laudable effort to modernize its institutions and doctrine petered out last year. The European Union has suffered the rejection of its new constitution at the hands of its voters, and NATO has been irrelevant in Iraq and has moved with imperfect unity and uncertain commitment into Afghanistan. The Bush administration makes no secret of the fact that its strategy in foreign policy is not to build international support through international institutions, but rather to forge coalitions of the willing on an ad hoc basis.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No doubt the pendulum will swing back again. Some day another global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> round may be completed; Argentina's leaders may trip over their own populism and return begging to the IMF. But for the moment the stalling of international institutions is striking  --  and troubling. Yes, democratic nation-states have more legitimacy and capability than international organizations; yes, they should remain the key units of international relations. But in a world knitted together by modern travel and communications, so many policy challenges cross national borders that institutionalized cooperation among nation-states must grow eventually. Financial crises, state failure, global warming, bird flu, terrorism: In the end there must be more than ad hoc answers to this constant succession of problems.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410159904.xml", "text": "<h2>At Best, a Pander; The Democratic candidates' intemperate promise to renegotiate NAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>NEVER illuminating, the Democratic presidential primary debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policy took an especially dim turn last  week. In their final head-to-head meeting before Tuesday's Ohio and Texas primaries, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and Barack Obama (Ill.) declared that they would opt out of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Canada and Mexico unless those two countries renegotiated the pact's labor and environmental provisions to the United States' liking. For two candidates who pledge to repair U.S. standing in the world, it was an odd swipe at our next-door neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mexican and Canadian officials recoiled at the prospect of overturning settled political and economic expectations in their countries.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What could the Democrats mean? Labor and the environment are covered by \"side agreements\" to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, negotiated by President Bill Clinton, that call on all three countries to make and enforce good laws. The more recent U.S.-Peru <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Promotion Agreement went further, requiring Peru to change its labor laws to meet International Labor Organization standards. Both Mr. Obama and Ms. Clinton, who supported the Peru deal, see it as a model for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> renegotiation with Mexico, according to their advisers. But if that's all the candidates have in mind, they are wildly overpromising: The Peru pact's labor and environmental standards are only incrementally stronger than the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side agreements. Meanwhile, the risks of renegotiation are huge. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is controversial in Mexico, too; farmers there are outraged by American agricultural imports. If the Mexican side asked that tariffs be reimposed on U.S. grain as part of a renegotiation, would President Obama or President Clinton sacrifice American farmers whose votes they were seeking only yesterday in Iowa? Or would he or she pull out of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>? If the latter, the tariffs on both sides would revert to the levels of 14 years ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whole U.S. industries have grown up to take advantage of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Meanwhile, none of the U.S. jobs that left for Mexico would come back; they'd simply go to China, India or elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Democratic candidates understand that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with the developing world has both costs and benefits, which are not evenly distributed across the United States. Two days before last  week's debate, Mr. Obama said, \"I don't think it's realistic for us to repeal <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" because that \"would actually result in more job loss . . . than job gains.\" Ms. Clinton awkwardly pleaded that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has benefited some parts of the country  --  such as Texas. Yet the urge to win Ohio trumped, and both Democrats made a threat that, if taken seriously, can be described only as reckless.  In other words, we have to hope that they were only pandering.</p>\n"}
{"id": "410200565.xml", "text": "<h2>Trade Distortions; Democratic candidates resort to far-fetched denunciations of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>POLLS SHOW that many Democratic voters are nervous about the potential impact of globalization on their job security. So some Democratic candidates are competing to validate every <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>-related anxiety and grievance, no matter how far-fetched. The campaign is turning into a contest to see who can make the most extreme denunciation of the nearly 14-year-old North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. In the Nov. 15 debate in Las Vegas, former North Carolina senator John Edwards called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> \"a complete and total disaster\" that has \"cost us millions of jobs.\" Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) claimed that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> had resulted in a net loss of more than 10,000 jobs in Iowa. Feeling the heat, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) has distanced herself from the agreement, which her husband pushed through a Democratic Congress. \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> timeout,\" she now says.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such demagoguery is worth matching against the facts about <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s impact.  Among nonpartisan economists, the consensus (as summarized in a 2004 Congressional Research Service report) is that while the bulk of increased <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> between the United States and Mexico since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> probably would have occurred anyway, the agreement's positive effects have increased over time. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> did not cause the current U.S. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Mexico ($64 billion last year, out of a $13.3 trillion U.S. economy). Nor did <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> cost the United States any jobs, on net, though it might have created a couple of hundred thousand. The agreement contributed marginally to the shifting of workers from some less competitive sectors to others. As for wages, a gap between higher- and lower-paid workers has indeed developed in the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> years, but the main culprit is technology, which increases demand for highly educated and trained workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not that any of the Democratic candidates seem to care, but the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> seems to have been both larger and more positive in Mexico than in the United States. Mexico's gross domestic product, now more than $875 billion, has more than quadrupled since 1987. The poverty rate dropped 10 percentage points in the second half of the 1990s. Average wages have not grown and wage inequality remains a stubborn challenge, but pay grew most swiftly in the Mexican industries most exposed to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, according to the World Bank. And Mexico, once considered the sick man of Latin America, has logged its progress while also accomplishing a mostly peaceful transition to multiparty democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A final verdict on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not possible yet, because the  last deferred provisions won't be phased in until Jan. 1, just two days before Iowans go to the caucuses. Among them is the long-awaited elimination of all remaining barriers on American corn exports to Mexico.

{"id": "419769161.xml", "text": "<h2>NAFTA and the case for CAFTA</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sugar is a good place to start a debate on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Most people eat sugar--probably too much of it this time of year--in one form or another. This sweet, mundane commodity is about to take center stage in another ferocious battle on Capitol Hill over the relative benefits and costs of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ten years after the U.S., Mexico and Canada signed the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, you might think that debate would be nearer a resolution. But even with a decade's worth of empirical data, it's still murky going. About the only statistic pro- and anti-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> forces agree on is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the partners has more than doubled over the decade, to $621 billion last year.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has brought lower prices and more choices for American consumers, and larger markets for U.S. manufacturers. Did it cost jobs or create them? It did both, but neither in quantities that have had much of an impact on the more than $11 trillion U.S. economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico had the most to gain or lose from <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and yet, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the pact has been neither the disaster predicted by critics nor the miracle promised by supporters. The World Bank, in its 10-year assessment, found that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has helped Mexico move toward the development levels of the U.S. and Canada. Because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the report says, per capita income in Mexico is about 5 percent higher, foreign investment 40 percent higher, and exports 25 percent higher than they otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements alone can't bring prosperity--and it's certainly true that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> hasn't done that in Mexico. But the reasons have less to do with <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and more to do with Mexico's failure to reform its economy and invest more in its citizens. Mexican President Vicente Fox understands this, but his attempts to remake the tax system, pour more money into education and innovation, and reform the rigid labor market have so far failed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most 10th anniversary assessments of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> acknowledge that it's hard to separate out the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> effects from all the rest that was going on in the world over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even without this pact, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers had begun to fall everywhere, toppled by successful multilateral negotiations in the World <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Organization and its predecessor organization. Mexico suffered a crippling currency crisis in the mid-1990s. The three- year bust after the U.S. boom has cost millions of jobs here and had a ripple effect on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners. The rapid rise of China as an economic force majeure has astonished and unsettled the rest of the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, on balance, has succeeded in doing precisely what it was intended to do: reduce <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers and increase <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> among the partners. But that doesn't mean critics won't continue to blame it for every lost job. Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> in general is under fierce assault. The critics rail that it hurts workers and wrecks the environment; it's capitalism run amok.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>'s benefits flow throughout an economy in the form of lower prices and more choices. They are diffuse and sometimes difficult to quantify. In contrast, its costs are borne--painfully-- by specific workers in easily identifiable industries, such as electronics manufacturing. Mostly for this reason, none of the Democratic contenders for president supports free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreements in their current form. Even the ostensibly pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> President Bush has engaged in protectionism in steel and textiles.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Global <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization talks are stalled, as is Bush's ambitious Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Area of the Americas, which would reduce or eliminate <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> barriers among 34 Western Hemisphere nations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Against this bleak backdrop and its own protectionist missteps, the administration doggedly continues to push the free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> case. The U.S.-Chile free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement takes effect in January and now El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have signed on to a regional <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact with the U.S. that is modeled after <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic may yet join that pact, dubbed CAFTA (Central American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement).</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The pact would eliminate industrial tariffs and reduce agricultural subsidies among the partners over more than a decade. But navigating CAFTA through Congress is going to be a tough slog and sugar is a major reason.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans pay two to three times the world market price for sugar because the U.S. government since 1981 has guaranteed a minimum price for domestic growers of sugar cane and sugar beets. It does this by restricting imports and buying and storing--or even destroying--excess production. (This is the kind of behavior the U.S. would consider outrageous protectionism if some other country were doing it.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The price of protecting sugar growers from cheaper imports, according to General Accounting Office estimates, is that sugar users--food manufacturers and consumers--pay an extra $1.9 billion a year. Mayor Richard Daley last year blamed these price supports for the general exodus of the candy industry from Chicago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>CAFTA doesn't even propose to get rid of sugar import quotas. But it would raise the current U.S. limit by 75 percent next year and allow a 2 percent increase in each of the next 15 years.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That concession is viewed as outright capitulation by the powerful U.S. sugar lobby, which vows to fight CAFTA in Congress. If the sugar lobby is successful, Americans will continue to pay more than they should, cheaper sugar from Central America will be barred from our shores, and the U.S. will continue to speak with a forked tongue on free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. (Do as we say, not as we do.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> pact would extend the legacy of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to Central America, opening once-closed markets and creating vibrant new opportunities. There is no question that it would disrupt protected industries both here and in other countries. But new opportunities can't flourish if the status quo doesn't change. Helping displaced workers from the sugar and other affected industries find those new opportunities is a wiser investment in America's future than protecting the principle that we should all continue to pay more for sugar. That's not sweet; it's a sweetheart deal gone sour.</p>\n"}
{"id": "420256122.xml", "text": "<h2>Genetic colonialism ; REGULATION; Good enough for U.S., good enough for Mexico?</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>MEXICO, MAIZE AND MONSANTO.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite Mexico's multiyear ban on planting genetically engineered corn, scientists have confirmed that engineered genes have made their way into remote cornfields in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For most corn scientists, this discovery wasn't a surprise.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For millenniums, Mexican farmers have managed the genetics of their crops--particularly corn--carefully replanting seed saved from last year's crop, exchanging seed with others and experimenting with new seed when the chance arises. Mexico's native crops may be traditionally grown and managed, but they are genetically sophisticated, far from primitive. Farmers have created a constellation of corn varieties for specific uses, from tortillas to tamales.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Mexico imports millions of tons of corn from its <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> neighbors, some of that foreign seed might find its way into its cornfields. It is likely that some farmers experimentally planted seed imported from Canada or the United States for human or animal consumption (seed technically known as \"grain\").</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Almost half of that corn seed contains engineered genes.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If a transgenic corn plant in a Mexican field had a chance to flower and cross-pollinate others, then the seed it sired would carry engineered genes. Because it's not unusual for corn pollen to fertilize ears hundreds of feet from a source plant, some transgenes could end up in a neighbor's crop.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But are unintended engineered genes in Mexican corn a big deal?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That question was addressed by a report released last year by the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation which studies the environmental impacts of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. The report came at the request of Mexican organizations worried about what these unexpected genes might mean for Mexico's environment and health.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regulatory scientists in the United States, Canada and a few other countries have approved the commercial production of corn with certain transgenes for insect resistance and herbicide resistance. The first variety was approved in the United States a decade ago, without subsequent evidence of environmental or health effects. The fraction of genetically engineered corn has grown to about 40 percent of the U.S. crop.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not so fast</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If it's good enough for the United States, shouldn't it be good enough for Mexico?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not without Mexican regulatory scrutiny.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Commission for Environmental Cooperation recommended reducing the likelihood that imported GE corn is planted in Mexico until scientists there can consider the impacts of GE corn in Mexico. This recommendation makes sense for two reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, regulators in one country don't consider possible impacts of transgenics beyond their borders. I once asked a regulator why a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision document didn't mention that corn naturally hybridizes with its wild relative, teosinte. He said, \"Teosinte doesn't grow in the United States, only Mexico. It would be presumptuous to tell the Mexican government what to do.\" And he is right. Environmental context is important. What is considered a crop in some countries may be a nasty weed elsewhere. Mexican government scientists haven't yet studied the impact of American transgenic corn in the Mexican environment.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Wouldn't Americans be anxious and angry about importing millions of tons of living transgenic seed deregulated in, for example, China, but not by our own regulatory scientists? Clearly, this issue of regulatory sovereignty is critical.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Second, unintended transgene spread could create corn varieties that might not be as benign as the intended varieties.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Corn has been the species of choice for genetic engineers who create plants to produce pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals not intended for human consumption. The USDA has approved hundreds of field tests for corn engineered to create such chemicals.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many of these chemicals wouldn't be harmful if they inadvertently ended up in food. But others would result in adverse health effects, if they occur at high enough levels.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Stringent confinement</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nonetheless, current U.S. regulations require fairly stringent confinement for so-called pharm crops; thus, if a few pollen grains strayed, siring transgenic seeds that entered the U.S. food supply, the concentration of such compounds would likely be too low to be of consequence or to even be detected.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because more than 99 percent of American farmers grow hybrid varieties, which are sterile, and thus buy new seed every year, it would be close to impossible for the frequency of such genes (and their unwanted products) to increase in farmers' fields or the U.S. food supply.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's different for Mexico. Some Mexican farmers use hybrid varieties and do not replant seed. But thousands of others plant saved seed from a previous harvest, often experimenting with seed from their neighbors or taken from a bag of grain distributed for human or animal consumption. Bags of grain for consumption have come increasingly from Mexico's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> partners.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider the worst-case scenario.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Assume a tiny fraction of corn seed imported into Mexico contains a transgene that creates a chemical that would have serious health effects in sufficiently high concentrations. Then assume a farmer experimenting with imported seeds plants one with the chemical- producing transgene. Finally, assume that gene confers an advantage to plants that bear it, resulting in more seeds or more pollen.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then, the conditions are right for the gene to evolve, increasing in frequency, undetected, generation by generation. The chemical also increases in concentration in the food supply until it eventually has serious effects on the health of those eat it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sound far-fetched?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Although this scenario is unlikely, each separate step has already happened. For example, both the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency have reported compliance violations in the United States involving seed- and pollen-mediated escape of pharmaceutical- producing corn genes. Luckily, the violations were caught in time, and crop products were destroyed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The limited planting of pharm corn (a couple of hundred acres) at this time makes international leakage extremely unlikely. But the popularity of pharm crops and the hazard posed by the \"worst-case scenario\" make clear that now is the time for Mexico to start managing and monitoring the inflow of corn transgenes, as the Commission for Environmental Cooperation suggests.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Managing and monitoring</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gene flow could be managed by treating seeds in some way that prevents germination. Monitoring could be facilitated by requiring that transgenic seed be genetically marked, say, with a seed color trait.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some have criticized the commission's report as flawed and unscientific.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet its scientific basis is sound. Agricultural biotechnology has potential for great benefits. But like any new technology, with potential benefits come potential risks. Like other modern technologies, from electrification to the automobile, the wise use of science maximizes benefits while minimizing risks.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Norman C.

{"id": "421117090.xml", "text": "<h2>A Shining Tour for Clinton, but Big Problems Remain; Now Latin America policy should be made to the rhetoric</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Measured in terms of diplomacy and political showmanship, President Clinton's belated first trip to Latin America was a solid success. But we should not be too relaxed, for no single performance, however professional, can assure a smooth road for the United States and Mexico and the other countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Sore points in the complex and intense relationships can flare at a moment's notice, and the goodwill that was evident in last week's multi-country trip can lose its luster before improved relations can be built upon it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President and Mrs. Clinton performed their parts to perfection on the five-day movable feast, mending some fences, playing to the crowds. The president presented his ideas on key topics like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, illicit drugs and immigration, important issues at every stop. None of this promised to raise Latin America's profile in Washington's foreign policy, but it was useful to both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Mexico, Clinton gave a boost to a relationship that had been going downhill for at least three years. He spoke of the things that neighbors must address: <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>, immigration, crime and interdependence. Alas, the positive feeling may last only until the next border incident or political scandal sends the relationship reeling again. That's how it is between neighbors, especially when there are points to be made in national politics on both sides.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo made ringing speeches and signed thoughtful documents many months in the making. Take for example the so-called Declaration of the Mexican/U.S. Alliance Against Drugs. The document spells out the danger that drugs pose to both societies in terms of corruption, addiction, crime and violence. These were good, strong words. But words come easily, achievements less so. Breakthrough action is needed: the arrest of Mexican drug lords like Amado Carrillo or the infamous Arellano brothers of Baja California, for instance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another big help would be the elimination of Washington's ill-chosen annual drug-trafficking certification process, which ties bilateral relations and specific programs to a nation's progress in the drug war. Practical help, not diplomatic censure, is what is needed. The drug economy is a three-legged stool: growers, traffickers and users--and most of the users live in American cities and towns. Full acknowledgment of this by U.S. politicians would be a step toward defeat of the menace.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regarding immigration issues, the Clinton message was the same in both Mexico and Central America. The United States is a country of immigrants but it is also a country of laws. And the law, the president emphasized, applies to all. Almost 900,000 foreigners immigrated legally to the United States last year, and they should be welcomed. But Clinton stressed again that the U.S. government will do all it can to prevent illegal immigration.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a speech in San Jose, Costa Rica, Clinton mentioned he was aware of the potential for destabilization that a mass deportation of illegal residents could have on the economies of Mexico and Central America and promised that none would be ordered.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Along with immigration and drug trafficking, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> was a major topic of the five-day trip. Clinton, a supporter of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement with Mexico and Canada in his 1991 presidential campaign, remains positive on the long-term outlook. Bilateral <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Mexico alone has increased 60% since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was established. Organized labor in the United States remains opposed, and that factor may diminish general enthusiasm for an even wider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This presidential tour leaves us with memories of the 1994 Miami Summit and its promises of cooperation and a hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement starting with Chile in 1995. But then came the Mexican peso crisis, Clinton's attention turned to reelection politics and none of the grand promises made in Miami came to pass. No doubt the Miami summit overreached. Latin American presidents were disappointed. A second Summit of the Americas will be held in Santiago, Chile, next year. Progress may come then, but the experience of these recent years should prevent high expectations.</p>\n"}

While each has aroused the passions of selected constituencies in this country, they also have been greeted with seeming indifference by the American public.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, President Clinton is pushing ahead in his drive for \"fast-track\" legislation that will give him the legal authority to negotiate new <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> accords like the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement without having them subject to amendments in Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And second, America's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan has begun to spiral upward again, much as it did earlier in this decade. To the consternation of Clinton administration officials, Japan seems unable to make its economy grow these days except through exports.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These were the sort of phenomena that once electrified the talk-show circuits in this country and were part of the lifeblood of presidential politics. Perot's warnings of the \"giant sucking sound\" <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> would produce as American jobs left for Mexico were a staple of his 1992 campaign.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such views have not disappeared. Author Pat Choate, Perot's vice presidential candidate last year, warned in an interview this week against giving Clinton \"blank-check\" authority over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals. \"We're dealing with economies that are really different from ours,\" he said. \"The concept of free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> with Japan or China is absurd on the face of it.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet Perot himself is a spent force. His political organization, the Reform Party, is ridden with internal divisions. And in general, the intensity that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> issues such as <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and Japan attracted in 1993 seems, four years later, to have dissipated.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why are things so much quieter now?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One important factor is that the unemployment rate in the United States is much lower than it was five years ago. <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> is obviously a much more potent political issue when Americans are unable to find jobs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another way of looking at this political shift is that many of those American companies and workers who were most threatened by foreign competition have already lost and moved on.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"A big factor is that we restructured our economy,\" says Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute think tank. \"We {the United States} got out of a lot of businesses. There are no U.S. makers of television sets anymore. We closed a lot of auto plants. So the {firms} who were being hurt are not around anymore. Some U.S. industries got wiped out.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Another factor is that concerns about the harmful effects of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> have been institutionalized. There may be less need now for an independent movement like Perot's, or for expressions of public outrage, because such concerns are being handled better within the existing political system than they were half a decade ago.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Organized labor, as well as such Democratic congressional leaders as House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), are leading the fight against Clinton's request for \"fast-track\" trading authority. Five years ago, as the American public clamored for action on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> imbalance with Japan, the Bush administration and congressional leaders such as then-House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) tended to minimize or explain away the problem.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, the political dynamics have been reversed. The public seems apathetic, but the Clinton administration is becoming aroused. U.S. officials seem to be preparing new actions aimed at bringing down the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deficit with Japan. \"If the numbers keep going up, then this could become an issue in the next campaigns,\" explains one senior administration official.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Above all, the public debate over <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> isn't ending, but shifting course. Labor and environmental groups and some of Clinton's opponents within the Democratic Party now say they are not trying to stop the globalization of the world economy, but rather are trying to make sure it will be regulated in a civilized fashion.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One veteran activist on the Democratic left, Robert L. Borosage of the Campaign for America's Future, points out that at the beginning of the 20th century, the Progressive movement took the lead in pressing for health and safety regulations that would protect workers from exploitation as a new national marketplace emerged in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The real question now is, given a global marketplace, what are the rules?\" asks Borosage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It is a fair question, one that demonstrates how unlikely it is that <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> will permanently disappear as a political issue in America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Jim Mann's column appears in this space every Wednesday.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: Vice President Gore and President Clinton head to meeting before talks with Congress on 'fast-track' <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bill.

Accord may ultimately bring real democracy to that nation.</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nov. 2 was the Day of the Dead in Mexico, a celebration of life and its tragicomic interrelationship with death. There's a special bread that's baked for the occasion, pan de muertos, in the shape of a skull and bones, a special bright yellow flower laid on graves, cempasuchitl, and short, usually funny, poems written and recited, called calaveras.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Nowhere among the multitude of graves spread across this big country was there even one this year marked \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>,\" so I am told, though it can hardly be said that the Mexican populace is happy in the aftermath of the country's worst economic crisis since 1982. In fact, in a recent poll conducted in Mexico City, 79% of the respondents said Mexico is on the wrong economic track. While not specifically targeted in the questioning, no doubt, the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement played a part in that rather overwhelming negative view.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> doesn't do too well on this side of the border either. In a Times poll conducted last year, people were split on the question of whether <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been good or bad for the United States. Were I to have been asked at the time, I would have voted with those who opted for \"mixed,\" for the following reasons.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, the agreement has been in effect only three years. Its implementation is phased over 15 years. Second, other events have confounded the picture, in particular, the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994, the severe recession that followed and continuing issues with Mexico's transition to real democracy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>U.S. exports to Mexico took a nose dive in 1995 as a result, but rebounded in 1996 and are on the same growth now as they were pre-devaluation. U.S. imports from Mexico currently are running about $10 billion ahead of exports, about the same <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> gap that existed in 1995 and 1996. Textile/apparel imports, in particular, are surging at unprecedented rates of increase. Mexico is fast replacing Asia as America's tailor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Interestingly and perhaps ironically, the apparel industry in Orange County also grew substantially over the past five years. This parallel development is supported by immigrant labor (not necessarily all from Mexico) earning the U.S. minimum wage and exists despite the lure of lower labor costs in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's hard to forget Ross Perot's powerful metaphor of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, the \"giant sucking sound.\" Claims of U.S. job losses due to <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> range as high as 400,000 (Teamster's Union), whereas job gains from increased U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada are estimated at slightly more than 300,000 (President's Report). The truth is that both are probably overstatements and that the overall net U.S. employment effect of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> has been slightly positive.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In Orange County, employment levels in those industrial sectors mentioned with regard to export growth into Mexico have actually declined. For example, from 1992 to 1996, employment declined 18.9% in aircraft parts. In computing and office equipment, the decline was somewhat larger, at 23%. But average payrolls were growing faster, at 28.1% and 42.4%, respectively, signaling an overall net improvement in these sectors.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Even during 1993, when the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate was at its apex, the most astute observers were commenting that, rather than being a radical departure, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> was most significantly a formalization and extension of tariff and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> liberalization policies toward the U.S. that had begun earlier.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>High rates of export growth to Mexico have been the norm for Orange County businesses over the past few years too, with annual growth rates averaging 25%. From UCI's 1997 Orange County Executive Survey, 26.8% of Orange County businesses involved in international sales and/or operations were doing business in Mexico, with 8.6% more planning to enter the Mexican market soon. In 1996, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the county's second most important export destination.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Probably the most accurate overall conclusion about the impact of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> to date is that it has helped Mexico and Canada without really hurting the U.S. In addition, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is not just about economics, particularly where Mexico is concerned. Mexico has a long way to go politically. It is hoped that democracy and a more export-oriented economy will begin to supplant corruption as the glue that holds Mexico together. The end result should be the strengthening and expansion of the middle class. But that is likely to take a long time, and the transition will undoubtedly have some rough spots along the way.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, patience is indeed going to be a virtue where Mexico and <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> are concerned. Let's not lay cempasuchitl on the grave of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> quite yet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTO: DENNIS AIGNER; ID NUMBER: 19980111ome0252; GRAPHIC-DRAWING: (no caption); ID NUMBER: 19980111ome0253</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Dennis J.

{"id": "421498571.xml", "text": "<h2>THE WORLD; MEXICO; Economic Growth Meets Weak Local Government</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Natural disasters have a way of exposing the weaknesses of Mexico's political system. The torrential rains and floods that hit central and Gulf Coast Mexico this month show how antiquated, inefficient and dangerous the system of governance is.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The tropical storm that swept across the states of Puebla, Hidalgo, Veracruz and Tabasco earlier this month was devastating enough. But what made the flooding that followed Mexico's \"worst disaster in a decade, in terms of lives lost\" (in President Ernesto Zedillo's words) can be illustrated by events in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As much rain fell on this bustling mountain in three days this month as usually falls all year. But Teziutlan seemed wealthy enough to protect itself. The city has become an enormous sewing center and one of Mexico's great success stories since the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement went into effect. American Eagle jeans and Oscar de la Renta shirts are among the lines produced here.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As it turned out, flooding created the worst tragedy in the city's history: close to 200 people killed in landslides, 500 homes destroyed, another 1,200 damaged, many more unlivable, thousands of people left homeless. A landslide at the La Aurora neighborhood, which is slapped onto the side of a hill, took dozens of homes and what investigators believe will eventually be more than 150 people with it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>People began building in the area about 15 years ago. But the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> sewing boom sent a hodgepodge of houses scurrying up the hillside. It was all unplanned, without proper subdivision. Teziutlan officials were helpless to manage the growth or insist on proper construction. Nor did they have a budget to install storm drains, repair cracked water pipes or pave the streets.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Teziutlan disaster is what happens when rapid economic growth meets a political system chiefly designed to manage poverty. Mexican local government, where this growth occurs, is unprepared to control, direct or benefit from it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexican cities' budgets, which are determined by Mexico City, are so minuscule that they cannot build and maintain infrastructure or hire capable civil servants. They have only slight taxing power. Moreover, mayors and city councils are barred from reelection: Every three years, they leave, and much of the city staff leaves with them. A newly elected slate must learn to govern from scratch. Mexican city government is thus characterized by constant improvisation and a lack of long-term planning.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This is one reason why economic growth in Mexico translates so slowly into economic development and higher standards of living. \"Globalization grabs us. It develops us very quickly,\" says Jose Luis Olvera, Teziutlan's director of public works. \"But as a government, we haven't been able to take the measures necessary to keep up. This is a national problem. Many places in the country are like this.\"</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan has had a sewing industry since the 1920s. When <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> lowered tariffs on clothing among its three participating countries-- Mexico, Canada and the United States--Teziutlan boomed.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least 100 plants have sprung up since 1994, when the treaty took effect. No one's even sure how many plants there are, since small maquiladoras were set up in houses or shops and the city doesn't have the staff to monitor them. The garment-industry work force, meanwhile, has swelled to about 35,000.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The maquiladoras gave rural folk from impoverished surrounding villages steady work, health benefits and the ability to educate their children. But the only places where the workers could live were on hillsides or in ravines. The choice was brutish: Starve at home or come to work in Teziutlan and live on the side of a hill.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Teziutlan's economy generates money that could provide for the basic infrastructure the city lacks. The money just doesn't stay in Teziutlan.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Under the Mexican system of government, all tax receipts go to the central government in Mexico City, which redistributes them to the states and cities. Cities get only 5% of revenues. The taxes that Teziutlan's maquiladoras pay subsidize the central government rather than help finance the local infrastructure needs that their businesses and employees create.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What should be a huge boon to a local economy instead becomes a cause for disaster. Local government cannot take full advantage of the investment coming into Mexico. That, in turn, prevents Mexico from enjoying the full benefits of one of its greatest comparative advantages: Its neighbor is the wealthiest consumer market in the world.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For example, Teziutlan will have difficulty leveraging its sewing industry into more skilled and remunerative manufacturing. It has no civil service to envision or plan for such a development. It has no money for job-training programs. It can't offer incentives to other types of manufacturing to relocate here. Its maquiladora owners have formed a committee to demand more infrastructure investment, but the city has nothing to respond with.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When wages hit a ceiling that garment makers can't afford, or when the city becomes too congested, the sewing plants, which are notoriously easy to set up and to abandon, will likely go elsewhere. Sewing will no longer be Teziutlan's stepping stone to something better.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Virtually every growing Mexican city is ringed with shantytowns that lack electricity, paved streets, drinking water and storm-drain systems. These cities generate money, but they don't get to spend it. Their ad hoc administrations can't prevent shantytowns and unplanned neighborhoods like La Aurora, but neither can they provide for them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They are as anemic as Teziutlan. The only difference is that these other cities haven't had a natural disaster come their way--yet.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Sam Quinones, an Alicia Patterson fellow for 1998, is working on a book about Mexico</p>\n"}
{"id": "421578437.xml", "text": "<h2>Los Angeles Times Interview; Lagos; Chile's President Looks to Expand His Country's Economic Profile</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ricardo Lagos' election to the presidency of Chile earlier this year set a new landmark in the country's long transition from dictatorship to democracy. He is the first Chilean Socialist president since Salvador Allende, who was elected in 1970 and overthrown in a 1973 coup staged by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Throughout his political career, Lagos has been a Western European-style social democrat. He is praised as a man always willing to walk the extra mile to reach consensus. During his presidential campaign, however, his political moderation cost him the support of the communists.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos rose to national prominence in 1988, when he led a campaign to defeat a referendum to keep Pinochet in power. During a memorable television appearance, Lagos pointed his finger at the camera and, as if talking directly to the dictator, he told Pinochet that the country had had enough of his repression, torture and executions. Later that night, according to reliable sources, Pinochet was \"climbing the wall\" after watching the broadcast.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos' act of defiance earned him the leadership of the Socialists, and in 1990, a coalition of the Socialist Party of Chile and the Christian Democratic Party won the presidency. Lagos served first as minister of education and then as public-works minister in two successive administrations. He holds a doctorate degree in economics from Duke University and a law degree from the University of Chile.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Though he has been in office less than a year, Lagos has led his country out of its first recession in almost 20 years. Chile's gross domestic product is expected to grow by as much as 6% in 2001. Unemployment, however, continues to run at close to 9%.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A confirmed free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>r, Lagos is pushing for more free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zones in the Western Hemisphere, starting with strengthening Chile's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> relations with Mercosur, the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. After that, Lagos wants to revive President Bill Clinton's idea, first broached in late 1994 at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, of a hemispheric free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone that would include Chile, Mercosur and members of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement--Mexico, Canada and the United States. Because of its strong free-market economy and political stability, Chile is seen in the United States as the model for Latin American countries to emulate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos will be visiting California Nov. 28-29 to reaffirm his conviction that of all the countries in South America, Chile is the one most capable of creating its own Silicon Valley. To support his optimism, he cites Chile's high levels of education and high-tech communications infrastructure. Internet use in Chile, as a percentage of the population, is the highest in South America.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lagos, 62, is an agnostic in a Catholic country. He divorced his first wife, with whom he had two children, even though divorce is illegal in Chile. Since 1971, he's been married to Luisa Duran de la Fuente. They have one daughter. He loves classical music and gardening.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was interviewed at the presidential palace, La Moneda.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Question: How would you characterize the U.S.-Chile relationship?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Answer: It is now going through one of its best moments. In the political realm, we share the same values. We both believe in representative democracy as the best form of government and we both place a lot of emphasis on the respect for human rights.

Chile has a very open economy. More than 50% of our products are imports. Very few countries have this level of openness. Our <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is very well-balanced. About one-third of it is with Europe, 25% to 20% with the U.S. and a similar percentage with Asia.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: But your main trading partner is the Mercosur <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> bloc, isn't it?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: With Mercosur, we have a political agreement more than an economic alliance. You do your foreign policy from your own region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you think the influence of the United States over Latin American countries has diminished since the end of the Cold War?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Most evidently. One of the effects of the Cold War was that the whole world understood Latin America was under the U.S. sphere of influence. I realize what I am going to tell you sounds a bit paradoxical, but the end of the Cold War brings a higher degree of independence to Latin America . . . as long as the United States continues to be the undisputed economic, political and military power.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Can you negotiate a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> agreement with the U.S. if the U.S. president lacks fast-track authority?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In Chile, I can negotiate any agreement, but our Congress decides whether to approve it or not as a package. I would expect the same from the U.S. I can't negotiate one agreement with the executive, then negotiate the same thing with the Congress.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Why does Chile want to get more involved in the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Because economic integration must be followed by a common political mission. I want to believe that someday there will be a free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hemispheric zone. Within it, Latin America could form an important bloc for negotiations with the U.S.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: How advanced are negotiations with the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Politically, things are going very well. We, the presidents of the countries in the region, have found common ground. But if we understand Mercosur just as an agreement to deal with tariffs and customs, then the agreement is not advancing at the right speed. As you know, Chile's tariffs are very low, in comparison with those of other countries in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Is it true that Chile supports the idea of including Mexico in a larger version of the Mercosur?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I think Mexico can play an important role precisely because Mexico is already in <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Aren't these economic groups often formed not to promote free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> but to increase protectionism?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes. But we should not forget that there is another debate on the hemispheric free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> zone underway. Every country in the hemisphere must understand that to make this hemispheric agreement happen, every nation must prepare itself for that moment. We should all understand that the free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> hemispheric zone would be one of the big blocs that will be in play in the 21st century.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: You and Vicente Fox, Mexico's next president, have a very good relationship. How did that happen?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: In 1997, when he was governor of Guanajuato and I was secretary of public works, he came to Chile. We agreed that the spirit of competition and the free market drives life in the global village. At the same time, we live in a world that needs public policies to restore some kind of equilibrium for people in desperate need. The free-market economy doesn't protect them.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Could you elaborate?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I may want to have a free-market economy but I don't want a free-market society. Why? Because that would reproduce the inequalities created by the free-market economy. I want to live in a society that provides free quality education to everyone from elementary school to college. I want a health-care system in which those who can pay will pay, but those who cannot pay can be guaranteed a minimum of health care. Some people believe that by leaving the market free, its benefits will trickle down to the poor. I don't believe the trickling down happens.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Are you concerned about the current political instability in Peru?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: My biggest concern is how to strengthen democracy in the region. It isn't good for Latin America to be perceived as an unstable region, because that hurts us all. That is why I hope the Peruvians can solve their problems. I hope they hold clean and transparent elections. As somebody once said, you may have a good house, but if the neighborhood is no good . . .</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some say Chile has an illegal immigration problem, with Peruvian laborers, in particular. How do you regard them?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: They come here looking for a job because the economic situation in their country, and in many other countries, is not good. I would like to find a way to resolve this situation within a labor framework. They suffer discrimination and often are cheated of many of the benefits they are entitled to as workers. . . . That is terrible. We recently passed a law to allow them to regularize their status, but we won't solve the problem as long as the different economic situations between both countries persist. You know that in California.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In the U.S., the illegal entry of workers takes precedence over their labor rights.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: That would be a problem. When you abuse the rights of a few workers who can't fight for themselves for fear of their immigration status, you hurt all workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Are you concerned that U.S. assistance to the Colombian military might lead to an arms race in the region?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I don't believe it will make us increase our military budgets. My concern is that if the Colombian issue is addressed only in military terms, the problem will not be solved. My other concern is that we will reach a point at which the countries in the region are forced to intervene in the conflict in Colombia. Yet, I can understand why the Colombian military is asking for arms to fight a group financed by drug traffickers who have large economic resources. We should also watch that the weapons the Colombian government receives are adequate for an internal, not external, war. With that kind of weaponry, they can't tilt the balance of power in the region.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Should criticism of human rights violations be construed as a form of interventionism?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: When human rights were violated in Chile, we learned that whenever the rights of human beings are violated, another human being should raise his voice to denounce it. On human rights issues, there can be no borders.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Do you believe current U.S. policy toward Cuba makes sense?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: There is no justification for the embargo.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: We just heard that retired Gen. Manuel Contreras, Augusto Pinochet's intelligence chief, was on the CIA payroll. Does that make him a traitor?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: To work for another country's secret service makes one a traitor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Have you demanded an explanation from the U.S.?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Yes, the Chilean foreign ministry sent a diplomatic note outlining the implications of that report and saying they were unacceptable. We also expressed our hope that such incidents never take place again.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: Some Chileans have told me they believe the U.S. should apologize to Chile for its participation in the 1973 coup against this country's legitimate president. Do you agree?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: I believe so. I think it does a country good to look back and reflect on its actions. Of course, the U.S. can look back and argue that the coup was a byproduct of the Cold War. However, I do believe that an honest explanation honors those who offer it.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: An apology or an explanation?</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A: Well, that will be up to whoever does it.

Just a year ago, no one would have thought that Chile's judicial system was independent enough to lift Sen. Pinochet's immunity. I believe the affair should end with a judicial decision . . . and that includes the possibility of medical exams for anyone over 70 years of age.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Q: In 1973, there was a trucker's strike just before the coup.

When Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama hit the hustings in the Buckeye State, they compete to be <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s biggest critic. But when they jet to Texas, which is also holding its primary Tuesday, the candidates have little or nothing to say about the pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The disparity illustrates two truths about major <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals: They're a magnet for pandering, and they produce both winners and losers. Ohio, like other states in the Rust Belt, is stinging from the loss of manufacturing jobs in the years since <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> took effect. In Texas, however, communities near the border have blossomed with an influx of investment, jobs and workers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And the differences haven't just been regional. The <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals signed since 1980 have helped spur job growth for some types of workers while decreasing jobs for others. Men at the high and low ends of the career ladder have benefited, but those in the middle have suffered, while the opposite holds true for women, according to a recent study by economist Stephen Rose at the Progressive Policy Institute.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The president's job is to take the long view of what's best for the country as a whole. Although it's hard to pinpoint jobs lost or created because of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>, U.S. employment has grown far beyond even pessimistic estimates of the <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deal's costs. You wouldn't know that listening to Obama, who declared in a recent speech that \"<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> deals like <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage.\" His stance is echoed by Clinton, who scolded Obama's campaign for distributing a flier that said she had called <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> a \"boon\" to the economy.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The centerpiece of both candidates' positions on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> is that future deals must include \"good\" or \"strong\" labor and environmental standards. That's vaguely comforting and feel-good-ish, but it's also misleading. Higher standards won't protect jobs and bottle up capital in the U.S. over the long term.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That's why the best course is to embrace free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> and fight for lower tariffs and other barriers to U.S. goods and services overseas. Protecting U.S. workers means giving them the education, training and, if necessary, retraining needed to compete for the higher-paying jobs that result from open markets. The capital and jobs that leave can help U.S. workers too by fostering stronger economies in the rest of the world and thus creating markets in which we can sell our products.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The increasingly global nature of business causes pain, but it's better to adapt to the competition than shake your fist at it.</p>\n"}
{"id": "422327674.xml", "text": "<h2>How to swing arms control</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>President Obama has scored his first foreign policy triumph by persuading the Russians to join him in a major reduction of nuclear arms. But if his initiative is to succeed, he must gain the support of another skeptical bargaining partner: the U.S. Congress. His fate in this second round will probably depend on the constitutional path he takes in gaining legislative approval.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has two choices. He can ask two-thirds of the Senate to ratify the agreement as a treaty under Article II of the Constitution. Or he can ask a simple majority of both the House and the Senate to approve it as a congressional executive agreement under Article I. President Nixon took the latter path when he negotiated our first arms agreement with the Soviet Union in 1972.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In reviving nuclear arms control for a new age, Obama should follow Nixon's constitutional example. Otherwise, he will confront the familiar prospect of Senate obstructionism. It was hard enough for Obama to get the 60 senators he would have needed to prevent a filibuster on healthcare. Going the treaty route would require 67 votes to approve the pact.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Obama submits the agreement to both houses for approval, he will still need 60 Senate votes to avoid a filibuster, but that is a far more manageable number, and final approval will only require a simple majority vote. In these partisan times, passing the agreement won't be easy, but there is a reasonable chance that Obama's initiative will carry the day.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senate opponents will undoubtedly cry foul and try to portray the two-house option as a devious trick to deprive the Senate of its exclusive authority to advise and consent on international agreements. They will note that every president since Nixon has used the treaty route on major nuclear arms accords. But the Arms Control and Disarmament Act recognizes the equal legitimacy of the two-house process, and explicitly gives the president the authority to determine which of the two options he should exercise in respect to an agreement. And the congressional executive agreement has been used in other defense-related matters.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Obama can invoke two basic principles to justify taking this path as well.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First, he can note that the two-house procedure is more democratic. Given Senate malapportionment, members representing only 8% of Americans could provide the 34 votes needed to reject a treaty. By comparison, the 41 required to mount a successful filibuster against a congressional executive agreement seems a large step in the democratic direction.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The two-house process is also more efficient. Even if the Senate does consent to a treaty, the entire lawmaking process must start all over again to approve the necessary implementing legislation, and at that point the Constitution requires the House to function as the Senate's equal partner. Although Article II authorizes the Senate to ratify treaties, Article I requires all legislation to go through both chambers.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In contrast, if Obama calls for a congressional executive agreement, the House is involved from the get-go. This allows him to package the agreement with the Russians and the implementing legislation together for a single vote -- permitting the president and Congress to move on to other pressing business.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The congressional executive agreement is more democratic and less time-consuming than the treaty alternative. Consequently, it has increasingly become the vehicle of choice for many kinds of international agreements.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Consider <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. After an intense nationwide debate catalyzed by Ross Perot, the Senate voted 61 to 38 to approve President Clinton's initiative. Clinton had submitted <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a congressional executive agreement, so this vote sufficed to assure final passage because the House also passed the measure, 234 to 200. If Clinton had proposed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> as a treaty, the Senate vote would have killed the entire effort.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With creative leadership, Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) might well win 61 Senate votes for arms control.

On balance, the pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> side has argued more carefully and, in our view, more persuasively.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But one line of pro-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> argument insults North Americans on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border. Delay or defeat of the treaty, some claim, would have disastrous consequences for U.S. foreign policy in Mexico and throughout Latin America, undermining reformers and speeding a return to the anti-gringo nationalism of the past.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That contention misreads the revolutionary reorientation of economic thinking that in recent years has transformed Latin America between Tierra del Fuego and the Rio Grande. And it ignores the fact that for all President Salinas' accomplishments on economic reform, he and his Institutional Revolutionary Party remain an obstacle to fuller democracy in Mexico.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Parties as diverse as Argentina's Peronists, Chile's Christian Democrats, Venezuela's socialist Democratic Action Party and Mexico's PRI have embraced free-market, free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> policies, welcoming U.S. investments and imports that once were denounced as instruments of neo-colonial bondage.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reason for this changed attitude is plain. For decades, Latin America's protected economies sank into stagnation and debt while those of East Asia, initially more backward, achieved rising living standards through export-led growth. Beginning at the end of the 1970's with Augusto Pinochet's Chile, Latin policy makers abruptly reversed course. Chile's success inspired many imitators.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the past decade democracy and market economics have largely advanced hand-in-hand in Latin America. For years, protectionism and government-sanctioned monopolies had been used to shore up support for the old authoritarian regimes. But those government-provided goodies enriched only the privileged few. Broader democratic electorates seem more interested in lower inflation, less bureaucracy and faster growth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the long run freer political choices are likely to reinforce freer economic choices. And freer political choices -- that is, wider democracy -- ought to the primary goal of U.S. foreign policy, in Latin America as elsewhere.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But in Mexico, politics and economics are on a collision course. President Salinas' PRI has ruled Mexico for more than six decades without interruption, relying heavily on economic patronage and blatant ballot-box fraud. His own election in 1988 was barely credible. And the limited political reforms he has introduced since then augur poorly for next year's vote to choose his successor.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the PRI context, Mr. Salinas is a reformer. But in today's Latin American context, Mexico is not much of a democracy. Americans should decide the fate of <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> on the merits -- its likely effects on the U.S. economy, on the Mexican economy and on the prospects for better understanding and cooperation between two neighboring peoples. The fate of particular political parties or candidates has no obvious place in these calculations.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mexico is going to have reasonably fair elections next year, it would be best that the U.S. not take sides. If it isn't, cross-border relations are in for trouble, with or without <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>.</p>\n"}
{"id": "429366916.xml", "text": "<h2>Public & Private; Over and Out</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've got an idea for a modification to the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement: we'll send Ross Perot to Mexico and in return we'll give the Mexicans anything they want as the gift of a grateful nation.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>After Tuesday's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> debate with Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Perot's career as a pundit without portfolio -- and without specifics -- should be over for good. During that 90 minutes, in a charmless version of his old cracker-barrel act, dogs didn't hunt, lines in the sand were drawn and the tooth fairy was mentioned twice. \"It'll only take a minute to kill this snake.\" \"If you believe that, I got a lot of stuff in the attic I can sell you.\" You know. Ross Perot's easier to imitate than Jimmy Durante.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot had a purpose in American politics for a fleeting moment during the last Presidential election.  He said that the emperor had no clothes, that Washington was a hollow place that ran on incestuous connections among lobbyists, journalists, and elected and appointed officials.  While campaignspeak was filled with smoothie rhetoric, Mr. Perot's was filled with the kind of aphorisms you'd expect to find in a fortune cookie at a Tex-Mex restaurant.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Several things have happened since. One is that the choir learned the song. There's barely a person in America who doesn't suspect that Washington deal-making has as much to do with the public weal as a black widow spider has to do with romance.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>(That common understanding doesn't mean an end to politics as usual: on the same day that Ross and Al did Yosemite Sam and Crusader Rabbit, Ed Rollins, who managed Christine Todd Whitman's successful race for governor of New Jersey, boasted to reporters that the campaign paid black ministers and Democratic regulars not to rally voters for Jim Florio. Yesterday he retracted the story, leaving Mrs. Whitman fuming, the ministers raging and the rest of us scratching our heads.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If Mr. Rollins, who parted bitterly with Mr. Perot after briefly managing his on-again, off-again Presidential race, ever wonders how the man could marshal so much support out of American disillusionment, he might just look in the mirror and wave a ten dollar bill at his own reflection.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Perot's allure evaporated, not only because people got the message, but because the messenger's act wore thin. And the act was all there was -- no action, just a stream of tetchy twang.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ross Perot became the political equivalent of the person who says he could write your column without breaking a sweat. Problem is, he's never sat down at the typewriter. Mr. Perot doesn't have to deal with Congress or run the government -- he only runs his mouth.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I'm in sympathy with those members of Congress who haven't yet decided how to vote on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>. It's fraught with ambiguity: could cost jobs in the short run, boost exports in the long run. But Americans hate ambiguity. That's why so many of them liked Mr. Perot.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The President thought he was killing two birds with one stone with this debate -- win friends for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> and reveal Mr. Perot as a crank. Mr. Perot, accustomed to appearing on \"Larry King Live\" as the centerpiece, was relegated to a place setting, and indeed it made him cranky.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He tried to replay portions of the Presidential race he popped in and out of like a flea with two dogs. (See -- we could probably even teach Al Gore to do this sort of thing.) He had his customary share of hyperbole: is this really \"the biggest lobbying effort in the history of our country\"? He also misjudged his audience, talking about the oppressed working people of Mexico; if <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> fails, it will be because Americans think it will hurt the oppressed working people of the United States.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Usually columnists complain when a debate is lively that it's not substantive enough, or when it's substantive it's dull. This debate was neither. If, as the Vice President said, <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> is right up there with the Louisiana Purchase, people deserved to hear more about both sides than they got on TV.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the evening accomplished one thing: it insures that, from now on, no one need afford Mr. Perot a platform from which to air what pass as his opinions. He's been called a demagogue, a populist and a gadfly. What he is, is over.</p>\n"}
{"id": "432679700.xml", "text": "<h2>And Now There Are Two</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On behalf of all the states that have not yet gone to the polls this year, we're pleased to see that the Democratic primary will still be chugging along when March arrives. True, the crowd has thinned. True, we already know the last man standing is going to be a U.S. senator named John. But in an age when too many elections seem to boil down to a choice between the unimaginable and the hardly bearable, the chance to pick between two perfectly good candidates for the presidential nomination seems like a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For a campaign that began with a love affair between Howard Dean and the angry Democratic base, things have taken a peculiar and definitely dispassionate turn. John Kerry and John Edwards don't seem to disagree on many policy issues, and until now, they have avoided attacking each other. Voters probably like the positive spin the race is taking, but they may also have a nagging feeling that unpleasant surprises are being deferred: bits of biography, personal tics, hard-to-explain votes. What's best known about the two surviving candidates is that Mr. Kerry is a Vietnam combat veteran who seems like a winner, and that Mr. Edwards is a millworker's son who strikes some as even more electable than the front-runner.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Edwards has a terrific stump speech -- people who see him for the first time frequently come away smitten. People who see him 10 or 12 times will discover that he has a talent for staying on message that makes even George Bush look unguarded. His political resume is short: the current Senate term he is completing is his first public office. On the plus side, that means Mr. Edwards has a relatively short record of votes with the potential to haunt him during a long campaign. (When he points out, as he now does constantly, that he didn't vote for the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement, Mr. Edwards does not add that when the Senate passed <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> in 1993, he was still a lawyer in North Carolina.)</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Kerry, who has been in the Senate since 1985, has a far longer paper trail and a harder time restraining himself from wandering off into the complexities of an issue. Listeners can find his explanation of why he voted for President Bush's war resolution either deeply nuanced or practically endless. But his gravitas and long experience with foreign policy issues might provide reassurance to a jittery electorate.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards deserves -- and frequently demands -- credit for speaking so consistently about the problems of the poor and the continuing challenge of racial discrimination in America. He is more conservative than Mr. Kerry about the amount he is willing to commit to a national health care plan. He supports the death penalty, and Mr. Kerry opposes it -- except when it comes to terrorists. Their positions on gay marriage are slightly different and hard to parse, but both come down somewhere in the general area of civil unions.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both men have shown a willingness to take a dive on principle to advance ambition. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry both followed up their support for the Iraq resolution with a vote against the $87 billion authorization needed to support American troops there and in Afghanistan. And it's too bad that their fiercest competition is a battle to see who can outpander the other on <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span>. Mr. Edwards hammered hard on Mr. Kerry's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> vote as he wooed blue-collar workers in Wisconsin, and Mr. Kerry picked up the theme, lashing out at George Bush's economic adviser for daring to suggest that there are positive aspects to outsourcing jobs abroad.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Edwards has won only one primary to Mr. Kerry's 15, but he had a critical victory over expectations in Wisconsin. In the current political culture, nearly winning a supposedly one-sided race counts for a lot. Bill Clinton, after all, became the ''Comeback Kid'' when he succeeded in coming back to second place in New Hampshire. The chances of an Edwards ascendancy still seem minuscule. No candidate with Mr. Kerry's kind of lead has lost a nomination since the modern primary system began.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, we have lived through a lot of impossibilities since this time four years ago, and have stopped counting on the normal thing happening. Besides, we are very glad we're getting the chance to vote.</p>\n"}
{"id": "855167662.xml", "text": "<h2>Mexico's Longest Haul</h2><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It has been 17 years since the United States committed to long-haul cross-border trucking with Mexico as part of the North American Free <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">Trade</span> Agreement. Mexico is still waiting for the U.S. to start trucking. Now the Obama Administration says it's ready to negotiate a pilot program to allow some Mexican long-haul trucks access to the U.S. market. With luck, the U.S. may be compliant in time for <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span>'s 20th anniversary.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What appears to be progress is welcome, of course. But the Administration advised low expectations, attaching the caveat to its own press release that \"this is a very positive development, but it is not a done deal.\" In other words, the usual political suspects could still drive it into a ditch.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Recall how we got here. In 1995 the Teamsters got Bill Clinton to put the kibosh on opening the border to Mexican long-haul competition. Mr. Clinton alleged safety concerns. But this was still a clear violation of America's <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> obligations. Then in 2001 a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">NAFTA</span> panel gave Mexico the right to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. exports. It did not do so immediately.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Hopes were raised in 2007 when the Bush Administration launched a pilot program to monitor the safety of Mexican trucks, which after one year had achieved better safety records than their U.S. counterparts. Mr. Obama killed that program when he took office.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That prompted Mexico in spring 2009 to impose (legal) retaliatory tariffs on $2.4 billion of U.S. exports. American business took a hit. In the first year of the tariffs, the Mexican government says imports of products on the list dropped 81%. It was the pain from those tariffs, not any free-<span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> epiphany, that brought Mr. Obama to the table last week.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mexico and the U.S. will now negotiate a \"reciprocal, phase-in program,\" according to the White House. A document is supposed to be available for public comment by early April. But if Congress has concerns (the Teamsters, naturally, are already complaining) the U.S. may have to go back to Mexico for further negotiations. When a deal is signed, Mexico says it will lift 50% of its retaliatory duties. It will take another two to four months to implement the program, at which time Mexico says it will lift the other half of the tariffs.</p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'></p>\n<p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If all goes as planned, the result is likely to get us back to the equivalent of the 2007 Bush pilot program by 2012. That's what's known as a <span style=\"background-color: yellow\">trade</span> breakthrough during the Obama Presidency.</p>\n"}
