This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination.

Knots of journalists could be seen in animated conversation in the newsroom. \"What do you think?\" one would ask, and then a heated discussion would follow. Were they talking about the Unabomber and the decision of The Post to publish his modest tome? No. The hot subject was a published criticism of The Post's <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> efforts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The venue was the New Republic, and the author was Ruth Shalit. Not only did she find \"racial strife\" at The Post but she accused the paper of so slavishly adhering to its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> goals that it had lowered its standards in both hiring and news coverage. At The Post, she alleged, the best man does not always win -- an assertion that does not conform with what I know. Shalit has that part wrong.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The editor of The Post, Leonard Downie Jr., vividly said as much. \"False,\" \"amateurish,\" \"shameful,\" \"racial McCarthyism\" and \"big-lie propaganda\" are some of the words he used. The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has produced \"racial strife.\" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging. Even apparently thriving ones conduct themselves as if bankruptcy is just around the corner, laying off employees, killing certain editions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of America is like that. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, conceived in an era when economic growth seemed an American birthright, has become a lot harder to sell in a time of economic insecurity. Under those circumstances, it gets a lot harder to accept a program whose central premise -- that race (or sex) ought to be taken into account in hiring or promotion -- runs counter to the American creed. What once seemed worth trying (despite some reservations) is now seen as downright threatening.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond what <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has come to mean to many whites, it is hardly an unalloyed boon to blacks. No doubt, it has done some good. When Colin Powell proclaims himself an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> baby, we are all obligated to pay attention to what he's saying. But attention also should be paid to the pained reaction of black journalists to the New Republic piece. Using unattributed quotes, it charged that some incompetent people had been hired simply on account of race. If such people exist, I don't know them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I admire what The Post is attempting -- and anyway, I can't imagine a newspaper without a diversified staff. I know the paper's managers and their deep commitment to racial justice -- to whites as well as nonwhites. But this utilization of ethnic, racial and sexual categories in hiring inevitably sets one group against another. The standard for success is not in reaching a certain percentage but in turning out a better newspaper. Numerical goals, while understandable, ought to be replaced by only one: absolute nondiscrimination.</p></div>", "displayed_text": "<div><p>`Goals' vs. `Quotas' at The Post</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Washington Post recently has been in a tizzy.

Graham, was equally exercised, and noted that the New Republic \"has never had a full-time black staffer.\" He suggested a motto for the magazine: \"Looking for a qualified black since 1914.\" In the areas of hiring standards and news coverage, The Post's response was so detailed as to be convincing.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, it was deviously clever of Shalit to choose The Washington Post to write about what, in effect, was <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. After all, The Post is a liberal institution -- and I am not talking about its editorial positions (not all that liberal) or its supposed political line (nonexistent).</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I am talking, instead, of its benevolent corporate culture. Firings are rare, layoffs nonexistent. Its journalists are relatively well paid, and they work for an organization about which they feel immense pride. I mean, the Unabomber didn't pick any ol' rag to blackmail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even here <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has produced \"racial strife.\" The Post's announced goal is to have minorities make up 25 percent of its new hires and women 50 percent. To that end, it has established an operation within the newsroom that, among other things, is responsible for recruiting minorities and women. The Post is adamant that its goals not be perceived as quotas, and, as with Ford, quality remains job one.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, to a white male a message has been sent. He feels himself operating under a quota system, and no amount of assurance that goals are not quotas is going to ameliorate the emotional impact. Somehow, a goal feels like a quota, and a quota feels unfair. The Post insists its standards have not been lowered. Okay. But for white males, a barrier appears to have been raised.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Washington Post-New Republic dustup may seem a parody of inside-the-Beltway nonsense, but the issues raised are hardly parochial. The newspaper business is similar to many others -- it's contracting. Newspapers are folding or merging. Even apparently thriving ones conduct themselves as if bankruptcy is just around the corner, laying off employees, killing certain editions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Much of America is like that. <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>, conceived in an era when economic growth seemed an American birthright, has become a lot harder to sell in a time of economic insecurity. Under those circumstances, it gets a lot harder to accept a program whose central premise -- that race (or sex) ought to be taken into account in hiring or promotion -- runs counter to the American creed. What once seemed worth trying (despite some reservations) is now seen as downright threatening.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beyond what <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has come to mean to many whites, it is hardly an unalloyed boon to blacks. No doubt, it has done some good. When Colin Powell proclaims himself an <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> baby, we are all obligated to pay attention to what he's saying. But attention also should be paid to the pained reaction of black journalists to the New Republic piece. Using unattributed quotes, it charged that some incompetent people had been hired simply on account of race. If such people exist, I don't know them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I admire what The Post is attempting -- and anyway, I can't imagine a newspaper without a diversified staff. I know the paper's managers and their deep commitment to racial justice -- to whites as well as nonwhites. But this utilization of ethnic, racial and sexual categories in hiring inevitably sets one group against another. The standard for success is not in reaching a certain percentage but in turning out a better newspaper. Numerical goals, while understandable, ought to be replaced by only one: absolute nondiscrimination.</p></div>"}, "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409936292.xml.txt": {"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/409936292.xml.txt", "text": "<div><p>The Forces That Set the Agenda</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the grand scheme of things, Social Security isn't the nation's biggest fiscal problem. That's not my view. That's the assessment of Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Bush political appointee before he became head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who says that looming financial calamities in Medicare and Medicaid are larger and more immediate worries in a strictly budgetary sense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As economic calamities go, more significant crises confront the states, which are responsible for our kids' education; the nation's hospitals, which bear the brunt of an overburdened health care system; and international institutions, which have to deal with famine, poverty and HIV/AIDS.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>With all these pressing woes, how did Social Security, Terri Schiavo's end-of-life fight and judicial nominations make it to the top of the Washington agenda? It's not merely because the White House or the party in power wants them to be there. It's because deep-rooted, well-heeled organizations have been targeting those issues for years. What seems like serendipity to the public  --  why is Congress talking about trial lawyers again?  --  is more often the result of an interest group's advance work combining with the right circumstances to send an issue hurtling into the limelight.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like it or not, we increasingly live in a stage-managed democracy where highly orchestrated interests filter our priorities. These groups don't have absolute power, of course. In the nation's capital, home to 30,000 registered lobbyists, hundreds of politicians, thousands of journalists and untold numbers of entrenched bureaucrats, no one's in charge. But long-established entities like the AARP, the Family Research Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce mold our collective thinking and regularly dictate the language and tenor of our civic debates.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This notion runs counter to an abiding myth  --  that political leaders actually lead. That's  true sometimes, of course, but more often than not, the ideas and movements that get on the government's to-do list come from the broad middle and not from the top.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A case in point: More than a decade ago, the National Federation of Independent Business, the country's premier small-business lobby, began to methodically contact its half-million members by phone and mail to categorize them by political leanings and their willingness to contact federal lawmakers. The lobby group trained its most eager members at local seminars and sent staffers door-to-door during elections in critical congressional districts. Regular \"grass- roots\" outpourings from this made-to-order machine vaulted NFIB- championed issues onto center stage  --  especially when the Republicans it favored took control of the White House and Congress. In particular, the inheritance tax (which NFIB loyalists redubbed the \"death tax\" for marketing purposes) was repealed (temporarily so far, but Congress is now considering whether to make the repeal permanent). This was the organization's No. 1 priority.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The process is a lot like surfing. Interest groups float along, waiting for the perfect wave of public sentiment or official fiat to carry their issues to victory. They can't create the wave, but they can be ready for the moment when it comes.

Those that do have a shot at winning.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Lobbying is subtle and complicated,\" says John W. Kingdon, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan who studies interest groups. But the most important attribute of a successful lobbying campaign, he says, is persistence --  something that only entrenched organizations possess.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"It takes a sustained organization, mobilized followers and an immense amount of power to get onto a legislative agenda,\" agrees Theodore J. Lowi, a professor of government at Cornell University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, interest groups have replaced political parties as the real influence brokers. Candidates for office rely on these groups for campaign cash, for campaign workers and, increasingly, for campaign issues  --  all of which had once been the domain of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republican ground troops come from such diverse groups as the NFIB, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Family Research Council and the National Rifle Association. Democratic soldiers are recruited from places like labor unions, the trial bar and Moveon.org. \"The standard distinction between interest groups and parties used to be that parties were committed to winning elections and that pressure groups let elections happen and then tried to influence the people who got elected,\" Lowi said. \"Now interest groups through their PACs and a variety of other methods are very much involved in the pre- policy arena.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Such involvement has become a prime factor in agenda-setting. Take Social Security. Few federal programs attract as much scrutiny. AARP, the nation's largest lobbying organization, is dedicated to keeping Social Security alive and well, as are groups such as the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The reason: Large portions of their membership depend on Social Security checks to survive in old age. AARP has taught a million and a half of its 35 million members how to hammer elected officials by mail, phone and in person, primarily about Social Security.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But AARP has learned that it needs to be careful what it wishes for. Its obsession with the issue has made Social Security a front- of-the-mind topic and, therefore, a perennial contender to shoot to Washington's upper tier. Ideological opponents of the current Social Security system have also been active, raising the issue's profile even higher. Free market think tanks such as the Cato Institute and anti-tax-increase lobbies have been churning out position papers for a quarter-century promoting partial privatization of Social Security as a way to undercut what they see as \"big government.\" One appreciator of that work: George W. Bush.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So when the president went looking for a problem to solve that could guarantee him a lasting legacy  --  and, perhaps, realign party domination  --  he went for that old chestnut Social Security. He also embraced a proposal that AARP dislikes  --  the creation of private accounts. That notion has fallen flat largely because of more than $15 million worth of AARP advertising against it. When the process moves to another phase and compromises are explored, AARP is likely to become an important negotiator and perhaps the key indicator of whether the effort will succeed or fail.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The same high-stakes maneuvering couldn't have happened with, say, Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, even though it's in more dire financial straits. Medicaid doesn't have similarly situated citizens' groups beating the bushes on its behalf. So while saving Social Security is the watchword of the day, Medicaid's fate will be to languish and occasionally fend off budget cuts until its finances reach an emergency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Terri Schiavo is another example of interest-group politics at work. The 41-year-old brain-damaged woman was in many ways not out of the ordinary. She was one of thousands of people whose families annually struggle with the question of when a relative's life has ended. But skilled marketers on the well-established, pro-life side of the abortion debate seized on her situation. The National Right to Life Committee, Operation Rescue, Priests for Life, the Family Research Council and others set up Web sites, held news conferences and raised lots of money for lawyers and for themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Their pleas touched a chord with millions of Americans and made Schiavo's plight a cause celebre. The omnipresence of her situation in direct-mail communications from those groups and on talk radio made her synonymous with the battle over life and death issues of all kinds  --  from the womb to the grave. By the time Schiavo's parents had finally exhausted their legal options and her feeding tube was about to be removed permanently, the public policy pump had been thoroughly primed. Republican leaders sympathetic to the cause brought Congress back for an extraordinary weekend session. Only later did it appear, based on various polls, that the majority of Americans did not see Schiavo's case the way the Republican leadership did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a result, the starvation of a solitary middle-class woman in Florida riveted government for a couple of weeks while similar  --  and more severe  --  situations went almost unnoticed. Mass starvation in Sudan, for instance, was a legislative footnote by comparison. Why? It's not only that Sudan is far away and hard to solve. Help for the Sudan catastrophe lacks the backing of as many obsessively focused and widely dispersed interest groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The brewing battle in the Senate over a mere seven judicial nominees is another telling example. Groups on the political left and right are making the coming confrontation seem like World War III. (Witness the use of the word \"nuclear\" to describe the Republicans' effort to force a vote.) In fact, the debate is a warm- up for the more consequential conflict over filling the next Supreme Court vacancy as well as a stand-in for other divisive issues, such as gay rights, abortion rights and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Why such tumult and passion? Organizations with wide and longstanding interest have been on the prowl for supporters on these matters for years. On the anti-Bush side are the Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and People for the American Way, which was instrumental in derailing Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. The president's allies include groups such as the Committee for Justice, Focus on the Family, the Federalist Society, Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks, which have not only raised millions for the purpose but coordinate their activities in conference calls among their leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In an odd way, all this attention to Washington ways is heartening.

But I remember none in modern times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans, members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make student loans -- $692 million to one company alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They bleat about states' rights. But they push through a bill to override the physician-assisted-suicide law twice approved by Oregon voters, and another bill to bar state courts from hearing class actions brought against industries that make big political contributions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unable to do what they want through the regular legislative process, senators have tacked on to appropriation bills a dozen riders stripping away environmental protections. Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime.

I think they were innocent of that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in the back.

But I remember none in modern times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans, members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make student loans -- $692 million to one company alone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>They bleat about states' rights. But they push through a bill to override the physician-assisted-suicide law twice approved by Oregon voters, and another bill to bar state courts from hearing class actions brought against industries that make big political contributions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unable to do what they want through the regular legislative process, senators have tacked on to appropriation bills a dozen riders stripping away environmental protections. Indeed, there hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial measures are increasingly embodied in riders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except one who was absent voted against Justice White. They all did so at the urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of Missouri.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senator Ashcroft charged that Justice White was ''pro-criminal,'' had ''a serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ''a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were lies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In support of his charge that Justice White is biased against the death penalty, Senator Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, Justice White dissented. Senator Ashcroft said the basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had said he ''opposed <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.'' That was a brazen falsehood.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Judge Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties to Republican because ''the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, of course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Kinder's lawyer asked Judge Blackwell to recuse himself because of his hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not ''hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the State Supreme Court said the statement would not ''cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Judge Blackwell. It was from that dubious assertion that Justice White dissented.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Justice White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed him, saying Justice White's record ''has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The real reason for Senator Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical performance -- even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who voted for Justice White twice in committee, and then against him on the floor.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Because Justice White is an African-American, the Republicans were accused of racism in rejecting him.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught \"collaborating\" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico.

No more carnage!</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But that's not the end of the story, because \"peace\" doesn't come cheap. Texas is still a star in Old Glory, but the American flag is put out of view in public places lest it alienate Hispanics. A complex bureaucratic apparatus now links Austin and Mexico City to coordinate social policy. President Bartlet doesn't dare sneeze in Texas without asking the Mexican president's permission, and all statements in relation to the Lone Star state are issued jointly with the Mexican government.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It gets weirder: Every HRA sniper and bomber that the FBI apprehended gets to go home, though many have just started life sentences. Picture a swarthier Timothy McVeigh -- who in our page-turner walks off death row a free man, met by a cheering crowd and a pitcher of margarita. The Texas state police force, which did so much to keep the HRA from killing even more people than it did, is drastically downsized and renamed. Made to feel ashamed, droves of experienced anti-terrorist officers retire early. A powerful police ombudsman is imported from Mexico, as is an \"oversight commissioner\" from France.

No, the president of the U.S. grovels. With no promises from the HRA on disarmament (its representatives have proposed how they might theoretically disarm, but not when), he promises to withdraw the National Guard from Texas and to dismantle its outposts. He announces an amnesty for HRA men on the lam, giving about 60 desperadoes a clean record. He promises the secessionist leadership that convicted felons can infiltrate the Texas police force, and serve on its supervisory board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>All this happens even though a new dissident group is bombing D.C. again. (The \"Real\" HRA comprises disaffected HRA members who still think -- and you can see why, with such an accommodating federal government -- that they can win Texas by force.) Mr. Bartlet dangles the possibility of disbanding the FBI's Domestic Counter-Terrorism Program, which HRA people despise because it's been so effective at catching them red-handed.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>You seem skeptical. Let killers out of jail, having served only one or two years? Not in the U.S. of A! Convicted murderers in the police, supervising police operations? As if! Decisions on the National Guard and FBI made solely on the basis of demands by a bunch of unelected terrorists? A ridiculous book! It'll never sell.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Your mistake.

Awkward formulations like \"putting arms beyond use\" -- in deference to terrorists' delicate sensibilities -- and lofty calls for peace disguise the fact that he is selling out his law-abiding countrymen for the sake of short-term expedience. The details of the latest shenanigans -- London's suspension of Belfast's assembly and its resumption 24 hours later, the equally theatrical submission and retraction of a vague IRA \"offer\" to disarm -- are unimportant, though their bureaucratic and rhetorical complexity, for both parties, is usefully obfuscating.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I cling to the conviction that no U.S. president would make major decisions about American security in accordance with the wishes of people like McVeigh. It's unimaginable that Americans would tolerate a commander-in-chief who installed unrepentant terrorists in executive positions of a state government, invited convicted murderers to join and oversee a virtually dismantled state police force, and released wholesale into the community felons after risibly short sentences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Oklahoma City aside, Americans have been lucky with respect to domestic terrorism. As it becomes easier technologically for small groups to cause mass casualties, that luck may not hold. If we ever are subjected to such a movement within our borders, we are likely to look to places like Northern Ireland for solutions, only to discover that the British government has prostrated itself before killers, lavishing a terrorist movement with every political gratuity it can think of -- throwing pearls before swine.

Never mind that a majority of Texans like being American citizens; these freedom-fighters aren't big on the fine print of democracy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Over three decades, the HRA bombs bars in Austin and Houston, killing about 500 civilians, including (accidents will happen) scores of Mexican immigrants. Its members murder state and federal judges, and any fellow Latinos caught \"collaborating\" with Texas state troopers, including caterers and garbage men. They assassinate over 300 policemen. When Washington activates the National Guard to keep the peace, 700 American servicemen wind up in boxes. And while most decent, hard-working Latinos in Texas don't support the HRA, they also don't mind all the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> coming their way since the ruckus started.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Airport novels must constantly raise the stakes, so we can't have the HRA constraining itself to Texas. Equipped by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, the HRA bombs Wall Street, causing billions of dollars in damage. In fact, the World Trade Center bombing of 1992 could easily be the work of these militants. They mortar-bomb the White House, and make unnervingly near-successful assassination attempts on both Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Is the American public enraged? Quite the opposite: It's bored. Another bombing in El Paso? Big deal. Texas seems far away, and a thorn in the side. Maybe it would be a relief to shed the place, which doesn't even generate much oil revenue anymore.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here the plot may take a turn toward the far-fetched: The sitting U.S. president -- let's call him Bartlet -- initiates a \"peace process.\" Laborious negotiations ensue involving the federal government, the Texas chapters of the Democratic and Republican parties, a political front for the HRA, and Mexico. (As to why the U.S. would negotiate with a foreign country over a state in the union, just suspend your disbelief.)
