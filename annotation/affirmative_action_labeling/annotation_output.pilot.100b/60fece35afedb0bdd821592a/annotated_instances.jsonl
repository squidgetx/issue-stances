Al \"The Mushroom\" Grzyb picked up his own phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a small miracle because the call lasted only 20 seconds. But that was long enough for him to explain that he didn't know anything.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He didn't know anything about the Duffs and Waste Management and the Blue Bag contract from City Hall.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And he didn't have any opinion on how the tough pink guys got $100 million in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> contracts through Mayor Richard Daley's administration. That's odd, since he was Daley's purchasing agent for 11 years, and he was the political firing pin on just about every political deal benefiting Daley's cronies.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Just so you know, if there's anything you have, I haven't read anything about it,\" Grzyb said nervously.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I knew it! That's big news right there.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb is obviously a loyal Sun-Times reader. They buried the Duff story Tuesday. Perhaps they didn't have a new logo they could use to claim it as their own--say a photo of the Duffs drinking with Daley at their legendary Como Inn Christmas parties.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And TV isn't interested in the Duff story much, either. The news broke Monday afternoon as federal prosecutors released court documents outlining their case against the Duffs. A TV reporter who has said publicly that he's not afraid of angering Daley explained why TV isn't interested. He'd like to do the Duff story, really, but there are no \"visuals.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What he meant is that there are no cars in it, or trucks, things that go \"vrrooom\" with lights flashing and so on in the file tape. That's TV news for you. There's not much video excitement in a contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But I thought that $100 million to white guys with Outfit connections who allegedly pretend to be minorities--and convinced their buddy Rich Daley of it too--is an interesting story, especially with the Duff federal fraud trial weeks away.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I'm not with the city anymore,\" Grzyb said, as if we didn't know, since we called him at Elzie Higginbottom's business office.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom's company, East Lake Management, ran that building at 69 W. Washington St., where six people died after being trapped in a stairwell with locked doors.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Higginbottom is a Daley guy, and Grzyb needed a soft place to land after he got too hot for City Hall. It's nice to know that Higginbottom's office can protect at least one person from heat.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb, whose name means \"mushroom\" in Polish, was asked about the Duff-Waste Management-Blue Bag deal that the U.S. attorney's office outlined in federal court filings this week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>According to my reading of the documents, here's how it played out: A City Hall underling figured out that the Duffs were not minorities, then had the audacity to deny their minority certification on the Blue Bag contract.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Sensing a grave injustice by being denied an opportunity to become minorities, one of the Duffs discussed this blatant discrimination with a top trucking boss and a Waste Management official and a \"City Official A.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Soon, Troy Ratliff, a deputy of Grzyb's, overruled the underlings. Grzyb approved the Duff contract for workers to sort out recyclable garbage for Waste Management.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any opinions on it,\" Grzyb said. \"I don't work for the city anymore. If you have any questions, call the city's press office.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Grzyb has been at the center of other deals for Daley. And he was never brought before the Chicago City Council for confirmation, because he didn't have the proper credentials under the State Purchasing Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But he had the one credential that counts. He knew how to say yes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Grzyb? Who was the Waste Management official you met with on the Duff deal?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I don't really have any comment,\" Grzyb said. \"That's it. Thank you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Mushroom then hung up the phone.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He wasn't the only non-chatty type Tuesday. The mayor says he hates corruption. But he had nothing to say.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"First of all, I'm not going to comment on it, it's a pending [federal] case,\" the mayor told me, a bit peeved, which is his usual expression when I come within 1,200 yards of him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I know nothing about it, I tell you,\" Daley insisted. \"I know nothing about it, any other questions?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I've been critical of the Duff-Daley deal, but now it might be time to reconsider.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We Americans tell our children they can grow up to be anything, from cowboys to astronauts. So why can't the white guy Duffs aspire to minority status, even if it's only on paper, and even if they are white men?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What kind of a country do we live in, anyway? Is this the land of opportunity, or is it not?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At least at Chicago's City Hall, miracles do happen, sometimes. And a very large miracle brought the Duffs $100 million of your money.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>----------</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>jskass@tribune.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 8s "}}

Some, like Melville W. Fuller, who presided from 1888 to 1910, inhabit the shadows of the court's history. Others, possessed of deeply held views and blessed with longevity or a favorable political wind at their backs, have touched Americans more profoundly than many presidents.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The fourth chief, John Marshall, was the first to leave his mark. It will surprise many people to learn that nothing in the Constitution explicitly authorizes the Supreme Court to decide whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In Marbury vs. Madison, Marshall deduced this power from the structure of government that the Constitution created -- and thus he created the institution of judicial review. More than a century later, Chief Justice Earl Warren led his colleagues to apply constitutional principles to outlaw racial segregation and to expand the rights of criminal defendants. Racial equality and the right to a lawyer may seem like obvious constitutional principles today; they didn't before Warren.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>When William H. Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court in 1972, he had ambitions that were similar in size but different in substance. Did he succeed? After 33 years on the court, the last 19 as its leader, Rehnquist's record is mixed. The Rehnquist court has slowed the expansion of civil rights but has not reversed it in most areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>A Victim of Cancer</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The chief justice has cancer and is mostly working from home. This comes after years of rumors that back troubles would force his resignation. The cancer diagnosis last fall intensified predictions of his impending retirement and sparked new discussions of his legacy and the court's future direction.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist found his politics early, in dinner-table discussions with his Milwaukee parents and, after Pearl Harbor, as a neighborhood block captain responsible for reporting \"subversive activities\" to the police. His interest in history, forged in high school reenactments of the nation's founding, has endured in his writings, on the bench and off.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In those writings, Rehnquist will often hearken back to the period after the Civil War. Many think of the Reconstruction era as one of brutal repression of minorities and a pinched view of the federal government. Rehnquist, however, finds his legal and ideological touchstones in those years: states' rights, a narrow view of congressional authority and a bone-deep skepticism about the notion that law should protect private behavior. As a Supreme Court clerk, Rehnquist wrote memos urging his boss, Justice Robert H. Jackson, to dissent in voting-rights and school desegregation cases. Young Rehnquist scornfully dismissed pleas from criminal defendants. When Rehnquist became a justice himself, he took his own advice.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist has been least successful in the realm of private behavior. The abortion rights decision, Roe vs. Wade, came a year after he joined the court, and the core of that decision stands three decades later, despite Rehnquist's fierce opposition. The constitutional ban on school prayer also remains. Rehnquist's years saw the court uphold laws forbidding consensual sex among homosexuals and, over his objection, then saw the court reverse itself.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He has had his successes. Rehnquist pushed the court to narrow or reverse many protections the Warren court had declared for criminal suspects, prisoners, racial minorities and students, boosting the authority of police, prosecutors, prison wardens and school officials. He and his colleagues struck down New Deal-era federal laws on the grounds that even the commerce clause of the Constitution -- formerly an all-purpose authority for the use of federal power -- did not authorize them. The Rehnquist court struck down laws concerning gun control, sexual assaults and cigarettes on this basis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>*</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>States' Rights Booster</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The sovereign authority of the states, by contrast, got a boost from Rehnquist. States are now largely free to execute murderers, destroy some inland wetlands and ponds, demote state employees who develop breast cancer or lock up some petty thieves for life, as California has chosen to do.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stopwatch efficiency that has earned Rehnquist high marks as the court's manager is also evident in his often-sparse opinions. Here it has not served him or the court as well. Instead of articulating principles that can guide judges and lawmakers, Rehnquist has often focused on the facts at hand. Your guess is as good as a constitutional scholar's about how the court will rule on any given <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> program. Why some terrorism suspects are entitled to legally challenge their confinement and others are not is similarly mysterious.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Rehnquist's most memorable accomplishment will probably be his most ignominious, and one of the most \"activist\" rulings in the court's history: essentially installing George W. Bush as president in the fatuously reasoned Bush vs. Gore. In the years before 2000, the Rehnquist court had rejected equal-protection claims from death row inmates complaining of racial bias, California homeowners challenging wide disparities in the property tax, gays and lesbians who wanted to serve in the military, and so on. But the same justices found that George W. Bush was a victim of an injustice worthy of the court's intervention.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The selection of Rehnquist's successor, whenever it happens, will be a high-stakes battle. Both sides believe that important precedents, Roe among them, now hang on one vote. Rehnquist's replacement with another conservative may not much change the court's balance, but with eight of the nine justices over 65, the next vacancy could occur soon, allowing Bush to shift the court sharply right and finish the job Rehnquist started.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 55s "}}

This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly,  racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots  of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's  during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim,  county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held  by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Studies of the 1966-69 riots indicate that rioters are especially vulnerable  to feelings of ''relative deprivation'' -that is, they are most likely to resort to violence when they see the conditions of those around them (often other blacks) improving. While many blacks benefited from the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, the mass of blacks in the ghettos remains unaffected, and city after city erupted in racial violence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1980, these conditions exist once again. Over the last 15 years, a class gap between the haves and have-nots has been slowly widening in most urban black communities. While the black middle class has doubled during that time (to between 35 percent and 45 percent of the American black population of 25.8 million), the size of the black lower class has barely diminished, and the proportion of workingclass blacks in menial service jobs may have actually increased. For example, in Miami in 1969 roughly 22 percent of the black work force held white-collar jobs, 23 percent held service jobs, and the unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent. A decade later, 37 percent of the black work force holds white-collar jobs, 27 percent is in service positions, and the unemployment rate is over 9 percent. (The rest of the black work force is in higher-paying blue-collar jobs, and there is a minute percentage in farm work.)  Dillusionment among poor blacks in Miami is also heightened by the fact that bilingual and lighter-skinned Cubans have taken many of the jobs that traditionally have provided openings for blacks.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The dramatic growth of the American black middle class has resulted largely from a wholesale decline of racial discrimination in the labor market since the  1964 Civil Rights Act, but, unfortunately, this decline has not benefited disadvantaged blacks who lack the opportunity to attend college and compete for  corporate and government jobs. These blacks, in urban cores, must seek workingclass jobs that pay a living wage. Unfortunately, desirable bluecollar jobs in craft work and manufacturing are increasingly rare in central cities. Trends in the economy, such as automation and the suburbanization of industrial  production, mean that poor blacks, especially young, uneducated ones, spend most of their time competing for dead-end service jobs such as janitorial work.  These trends remain unaffected by strategies to fight discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our most conspicuous such strategy is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, and, indeed, already we are hearing that the answer to the Miami riot is to invigorate <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> programs. However well-intentioned such responses may be, undoubtedly they will have a perverse effect on race relations. By using race-conscious criteria, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> creates a divisive backlash among ethnic groups and workingclass whites. In addition, such programs also widen the class gap in the black community by helping a small portion of the community to  attend college, graduate school, and compete for desirable jobs, while the most  disadvantaged segments of the black community remain essentially untouched. What poor blacks need, at a minimum, is programs that are drected toward them: programs that will ensure full employment, increase teen-age employment opportunities, and meaningfully reform the welfare system.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Regrettably, these programs, or what is left of them, are being slashed from  the Federal budget. In the absence of these modest efforts, we cannot expect any significant improvement in the lot of poor blacks, regardless of strenuous efforts to combat discrimination. If the Congress and President Carter insist on cutting these programs to provide increased defense spending, then we must also face the perilous prospect that our cities will remain racial tinderboxes.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Whitman is a senior research assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}

As executive director of the Rev. Pat Robertson's very big, influential and conservative Christian Coalition, Reed has vigorously opposed mainstream civil rights leaders on such key issues as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and welfare reform.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But, the idea of Beijing hosting the notoriously Red-baiting Nixon sounded laughable, too, until it happened. At least Reed has a shorter leap to make than Nixon did.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reed has long called on white, Christian conservatives to make amends for centuries they spent on the wrong side of black liberation. In his 1994 book, \"Politically Incorrect: The Emerging Faith Factor in American Politics,\" he wrote that historical cooperation with slavery and segregation \"undermined the moral authority of religious conservatives as they have sought to redress other forms of social injustice--abortion, euthanasia, religious bigotry--in recent times.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To plug the gap, the coalition has announced Samaritan Project, a multiracial program to rejuvenate low-income, inner-city neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Headed by an African-American, the Rev. Earl Jackson, the coalition's national liaison for community development, the Samaritan Project offers compassionate conservatives a chance to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Among other ideas, it proposes a new multiracial partnership to revitalize local churches and rejuvenate the national debate on racial justice. It commits the coalition's members and its network of 125,000 churches to raise funds for partnerships with 1,000 inner-city churches by 2000, particularly for those churches which are helping at-risk youths.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On racial justice, the coalition plans a May conference in Baltimore to which black and white church leaders from across the nation are invited to hammer out an agenda for cooperation \"across racial and cultural lines.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In a conference call with me and six other newspaper columnists last week, Reed and Jackson said the project was inspired by the organization's successful call for white churches to help rebuild black churches destroyed in last year's wave of church burnings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So far, Reed and Jackson said, they have raised $850,000 and given away most of it in grants averaging $20,000 per church to 40 congregations.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"African-American leaders were far more receptive than I ever thought possible,\" Reed said. \"I never asked people whether they were Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative. It has changed us. God took a tragedy and turned it into something good.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The help could hardly go to a better place. The black church has been the African-American community's most durable and liberating institution through times much tougher than these. Black church leaders were the core of the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement and countless independent, self-help neighborhood housing and social service programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unfortunately, their successes usually wind up on the back pages of local newspapers, if at all, making a very small blip on the media's or the public's radar screens.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Christian Coalition can bring the communications network that can help black churches feel less isolated.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It can also bring about public attention that can help change society's prevailing cynicism about the ability of poor people to help themselves.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Publicity does have its virtues. Assignment editors who yawn at the efforts of a little church here or there suddenly perk up when Ralph Reed holds a press conference.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On the less noble side, there is no question that conservatives hope the Samaritan Project will improve not only their moral authority but also their political clout. In return, the coalition hopes it can win black support for an array of ideas liberal leaders tend to oppose: school vouchers, a tax credit (not just a deduction) for charitable donations, tax breaks to encourage business investments in depressed areas and vouchers for schools and drug rehabilitation programs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Each of these ideas is currently being proposed in various forms in the House by Oklahoma's J.C. Watts, Congress' only black Republican, and in the Senate by Republican Daniel Coats of Indiana.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So be it. Black church leaders will have to decide for themselves whether the Samaritan Project is manna from Heaven or a Trojan horse. In the meantime, I am delighted, after years of racially polarized national politics, to see conservatives compete with liberals for black support. It's also refreshing to see churches take the lead again for racial reconciliation. We can use a few miracles.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>GRAPHIC; Caption: GRAPHIC: Illustrtion by David Csicsko.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}

It reads in part, \"Understanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\" and \"I regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\"But Ms. Smith wasn't the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \"cognitive diversity\" is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of -- individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company's race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \"biological causes.\" It included the line, \"Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\"To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important.

The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic  in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v.

{"id": "test_question_pro_testing_2", "displayed_text": "<p>The Trump administration is wrong on Yale admissions</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale is under attack for allegedly doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds. In reality, the university hasn't done enough.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For Yale students and faculty of color, progress has often been slow and incremental. It took 86 years and dozens of protests for Yale to rename a campus residential building dedicated to John C. Calhoun, one of this country's most notorious advocates of slavery. It took 22 years and dozens of petitions for Yale to grant (limited) hiring power to its ethnic studies department. Yale, built for White men at its founding in 1701 and funded in part by slave labor, has only recently begun to seriously investigate its role in the slave trade.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The lack of diversity among faculty remains stark: Black, Hispanic/Latino and Native American faculty together make up fewer than 8 percent of the university's educators, while Asian American faculty are 13.8 percent and White faculty count for 64.2 percent. Although the university has taken substantial steps toward equity and equality, more diversity is needed on campus today and among future leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite the long road ahead, the Trump administration filed suit against Yale this month, alleging discrimination against Asian American and White applicants. It first alleged such discrimination in August, when the Justice Department ordered Yale to stop considering race or national origin in undergraduate admissions for one year.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The administration hopes to set a legal precedent that would end the use of race-conscious admissions at Yale and peer institutions. When a conservative nonprofit sued Harvard in 2014 over allegations similar to the ones against Yale, a federal court in Massachusetts found that eliminating consideration of race in admissions without other policy changes \"would cause the African American representation at Harvard to decline from approximately 14% to 6% of the student population and Hispanic representation to decline from 14% to 9%.\" Simply removing race considerations is likely to have similar detrimental effects at other colleges.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The scope of the challenge in diversifying elite college admissions can be seen in national data on race and ethnicity and school poverty. In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, some 25 percent of U.S. students attended \"high-poverty\" public schools, or those where more than three-quarters of the student body were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Of all White U.S. students, just 8 percent attended such schools. The share among other groups, however, is significantly higher: Black (45 percent), Hispanic (45 percent), Native American (41 percent) and Pacific Islander (24 percent). The breakdown for \"low-poverty\" schools is lopsided in the other direction: Some 31 percent of White and 39 percent of Asian American students attended low-poverty schools in 2017, compared with just 7 percent of Black students and 8 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Beverly Daniel Tatum discusses in her book, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race,\" majorities of Black and Latino students attend segregated schools that are more likely to have less experienced teachers, high levels of teacher turnover, inadequate facilities and fewer classroom resources. Such supports are critical to students' future advancement.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Yale College will not change its admissions processes,\" Yale President Peter Salovey rightly pledged in August. The university \"will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yale students from an array of racial and ethnic backgrounds criticized the Trump administration's allegations this summer, and we will continue to both push back against these claims and support Yale's administration in defending its admissions policies in court.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Justice Department's lawsuit is, unfortunately, the latest action in the Trump administration's campaign against race-conscious admissions. The Education Department opened an investigation into Princeton University last month after Princeton's president spoke about the university's efforts to grapple with the effects of systemic racism. It is possible the cycle of lawsuits and appeals might ultimately bring a case about race and admissions to the Supreme Court. The likely expansion of the high court's conservative majority could mean that the very existence of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and race-conscious university admissions is at risk.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Last month marked the end of my tenure as the first Black student-body president in Yale's 319-year history. I don't want the university to go years and years before its next Black student-body president. Although Yale is being attacked for doing too much to support students from underrepresented backgrounds, the truth is that Yale still has far to go.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Where our university community has worked to take steps forward, the Trump administration wants to drag us back. This lawsuit seeks to impede efforts for equity in higher education and destroy the foundation on which so many seek to build. My fellow students and I refuse to let that happen.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The writer is an undergraduate at Yale University.

But then, on a cold day in March, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The new president pulled no punches, laying blame for the country's financial woes squarely on Wall Street speculators -- and, by implication, on their benefactors in Washington. \"They have no vision,\" he said, citing a passage from the Bible, \"and when there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Roosevelt, by contrast, clearly articulated a vision that reawakened the hope of a beleaguered nation. He spoke that day of the country's greatest need -- putting people back to work -- and he laid out a plan for achieving that goal.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Decades later, when Americans faced a serious recession, Bill Clinton reflected on the same biblical passage when accepting the presidential nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention. \"I hope nobody ... in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision,\" he said. \"I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Americans today aren't interested in slogans and sound bites. They want the candidates to offer them a vision, but so far neither Mitt Romney nor President Obama has done so.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Republicans are recycling tired promises from the Reagan era, preaching a gospel of small government and fiscal responsibility. But their words ring hollow. Republicans have been sounding that theme for decades, but they've never put it into practice. Reagan tripled the national debt. George W. Bush nearly doubled it, and left a legacy of debt from two unfunded wars and unfunded tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As a messaging strategist who has worked with office-seekers and officeholders at all levels of government, including the presidency, I have closely examined the reaction of voters to the standard Republican narrative about taking care of \"job creators\" and eliminating \"red tape that's strangling business.\" The response of voters across the political spectrum is lukewarm. Americans may yet elect Romney, but it won't be because they really buy what he's selling.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Voters aren't hearing a clear message from Obama either. On the one hand, he's pushing for more stimulus, but he is also the architect of a \"grand bargain\" that will cut more than $2 trillion from the 2013 federal budget, imposing the same kind of \"austerity\" that has proved so counterproductive in Europe.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So why hasn't either candidate offered a clear vision that resonates with the American people?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One reason is that, in a time that requires boldness, the two presidential candidates are both cautious by nature. But there are other reasons as well.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One is the role of money in politics. Roosevelt attacked Wall Street in his first speech as president, and backed up his rhetoric with one piece of legislation after another to limit its power. He used government money to put Americans directly to work -- something no one had dreamed of doing before -- and created Social Security, a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. In today's political culture, presidential candidates and legislators are beholden to Wall Street to support their campaigns, which has made the passage of such measures inconceivable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The second reason for the paucity of vision is historical. For nearly 50 years, the Roosevelt legacy guided Democratic and Republican presidents alike. Dwight Eisenhower scoffed at the idea, proposed by his right flank, of dismantling New Deal programs, and instead expanded the role of the federal government by creating the interstate highway system. Richard Nixon greatly extended the federal government's role in protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink by creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Then came Ronald Reagan, who drew on his charisma to undo as much of what Roosevelt built as he could. He did so by sounding themes that resonated with voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One was based on a legitimate concern that once a government program was created, it developed barnacle-like constituencies that made it as difficult to dismantle as a barrier reef. A second theme was racial, with talk of Cadillac-driving \"welfare queens.\" This was a continuation of Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" that served to solidify the GOP stronghold in the South. A third spoke to the aftershock of the 1960s, one of the most rapid periods of social change in history. This was a note that resonated with many Americans, particularly with white working-class males who'd been left frightened and angry by the women's movement and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, which challenged them both at home and at work.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But at its heart Reagan's critique was of a government that was too powerful, too large, too intrusive. What he didn't mention was that the radical deregulation that he set in motion was also making government more corrupt with every passing campaign dollar. The result was a rising tide of inequality and insecurity for ordinary Americans unseen since the Depression.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Today, the parties and their standard-bearers continue to labor under the broken ideology of Reagan -- an ideology that led, in the hands of George W. Bush, to the Great Recession of 2008. The struggles of working- and middle-class Americans four years later reflect the failure of any leader to transcend Reagan's ideology. Romney continues to claim it as his own, while Obama hasn't offered a coherent alternative.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1987, when Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, was considering a run for the presidency, he was casting about for campaign themes when a friend urged him to take some time to think about what vision he wanted to offer the American people. Oh yeah, Bush responded dismissively, \"the vision thing.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>He was the only one-term Republican president in the last 80 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University and the author of \"The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\" His consulting firm, Westen Strategies, is not working for either candidate in this year's presidential race.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: (no caption); PHOTOGRAPHER:Danny Schwartz For The Times</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1370789528.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Supreme Court can tune up the Voting Rights Act (Posted 2013-06-25 02:35:16)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Not every law that's constitutional is also wise. Keep that in mind as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It seems like an easy case. How could a federal statute designed to end the historic suppression of African American voting not be constitutional? The 15th Amendment gives voters of all races equal rights and expressly grants Congress the power to enforce those rights -- which Congress exercised by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act (VRA) for 25 years in 2006.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The vote was 98 to 0 in the Senate and 390 to 33 in the House; a conservative Republican president from Texas, George W. Bush, signed the legislation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>If judicial restraint means anything, surely it counsels Supreme Court affirmation of the VRA -- against the pending challenge by Shelby County, Ala., which says it has basically ended voter discrimination so Congress has no right to subject it, or other mostly Southern jurisdictions, to Justice Department \"pre-clearance\" of its election rules, as prescribed in Section 5 of the law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As Judge David Tatel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit wrote for the majority of a three-judge panel last year,\"in this context, we owe much deference to the considered judgment of the People's elected representatives.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Here's the problem: Although hugely successful at securing the franchise for individual black voters, the Voting Rights Act has had corrosive unintended consequences, including, ironically, greater political polarization along racial lines.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As construed by courts, modified by Congress and enforced by the Justice Department, the act all but requires covered jurisdictions to maximize the concentration of African American and other minority voters in legislative districts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In theory, this enables minorities to elect candidates \"of their choice.\" In practice, it divides many states into a small number of majority-black districts, which usually pick liberal African American Democrats, and a larger number of overwhelmingly white districts, which choose conservative white Republicans. Moderates get squeezed out.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Voting Rights Act is one reason House debates so often pit upstart tea party Republicans from Southern suburbs against veteran African American Democrats from Southern cities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Civil rights organizations defend the legislation's current incarnation as if the risks to minority enfranchisement were unchanged since 1965. This is understandable. Much as <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in universities helped build a middle class after segregation, \"opportunity districts\" for minority candidates helped create a cadre of black elected officials. The act's pre-clearance showed continuing relevance as a check on potentially discriminatory voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Still, the law too often produces anomalies such as the 2003 case Georgia v. Ashcroft, in which civil rights organizations sided with a Republican Justice Department against a state redistricting plan on the grounds that it did not create enough majority-minority districts -- even though Georgia's African America Democratic officeholders overwhelmingly supported the plan because they wanted to spread black votes, and influence, more widely.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For the most part, minority voters no longer face the kind of blunt denial of voting rights that gave rise to the 1965 act; in 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, according to a Pew Research center analysis.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In such a world, the corrosive political effects of racial gerrymandering under the VRA loom larger -- even compared with the benefits to minority candidates. The creation of safe minority districts put a floor under the number of blacks elected but also, arguably, a ceiling over how high they can rise.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the South, the message and ideology that win in a majority-minority district rarely work at the (majority-white) statewide level.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Congress didn't really tackle such issues when it extended the Voting Rights Act in 2006. Small wonder: Incumbents of both parties and all races owe their positions to the current system. A shake-up of the status quo might have exposed them, and then-President Bush, to election-year charges of racial insensitivity.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Fact is, by 2006 the Supreme Court had expressed concerns about the real-world consequences of the Voting Rights Act in several cases,and it has again since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It should surprise no one if the Roberts Court invokes precedent requiring that federal impositions on the states be \"congruent and proportional\" to the civil rights violations they remedy, and it strikes down, or guts, pre-clearance -- holding that rules based on mid-1960s political realities are simply out of sync with the 21st century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That would be a pretty activist ruling. But it might just start a healthy debate about how we can protect voting rights while restoring the nation's political center.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>lanec@washpost.com</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 13s "}}
