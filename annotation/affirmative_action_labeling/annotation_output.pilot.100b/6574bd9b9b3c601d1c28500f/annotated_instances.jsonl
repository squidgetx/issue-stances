They then invoked an obscure Senate rule that required the judicial candidates to be re-nominated. (Yes, these are the same Republicans who used to loudly demand that every one of President George W. Bush's nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, regardless of their qualifications.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The most prominent of the five repeaters is Goodwin Liu, a law professor and legal scholar who would be the only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Liu went to Stanford, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and graduated from Yale Law School. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before beginning a teaching career at the University of California, Berkeley,  School of Law.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Indeed, it is largely his stellar background that is fueling Republican opposition. Mr. Liu, who is 39, is seen as a strong possibility to be on President Obama's short list for a future Supreme Court vacancy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives do not like Mr. Liu's support for same-sex marriage rights, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and his view that the Constitution is a living document that evolves over time. But his views fall well within the legal and political mainstream. His warnings that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito would turn out to be extremely conservative were accurate. But Mr. Liu is no rigid liberal ideologue, as his support of school vouchers and charter schools attest. Kenneth Starr, the conservative lawyer who investigated President Bill Clinton, co-signed a letter vouching for Mr. Liu's \"independence and openness to diverse viewpoints.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It would be nice if some Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr. Liu and the four other re-nominees (along with three other new nominees). Whether they do or not, the White House and Senate Democrats should persist in fighting for their confirmation and the confirmation of the 16 other pending nominees already approved by the committee.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At the comparable point in the Bush presidency, the Senate had confirmed 61.4 percent of Mr. Bush's nominees. For Mr. Obama, it's under 50 percent. His nominees are no radicals. That description applies to Republicans holding up well-qualified choices like Mr. Liu.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 47s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/434126284.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Meet The New Elite, Not Like The Old</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- They are the children of 1969 -- the year that America's most prestigious universities began aggressively recruiting blacks and Latinos to their nearly all-white campuses.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No longer would Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia be the domain of the privileged. Instead, in response to the national soul-searching prompted by the civil rights movement, America's premier colleges would try to become more representative of the population as a whole.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Forty years later, America is being led, to a striking extent, by a new elite, a cohort of the best and the brightest whose advancement was formed, at least in part, by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> policies. From Barack and Michelle Obama (Columbia, Princeton, Harvard) to Eric Holder (Columbia) to Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale) to Valerie Jarrett (Michigan, Stanford),  the country  is now seeing, in full flower, the fruition of this wooing of  minorities to institutions that for much of the nation's history have groomed America's leaders.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And yet the consequences of that change remain unresolved, as became  clear on Friday, when Mr. Obama grappled a second time with the arrest of the Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his own home.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The incident, the president said, offered the potential to soothe  longstanding distrust between minorities and police officers. But it also laid bare another reality, that the children of 1969, even those who now occupy niches at the top of society, regard their status as complicated, ambiguous and vulnerable.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"Whether I were black or white, I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive -- as opposed to negative -- understandings about the issue, is part of my portfolio,\" Mr. Obama said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was a reminder that Mr. Obama, in addition to being the most powerful American, is also the fulfillment of the ideals embraced by Ivy League minority recruiters in 1969. Mr. Gates entered Yale that year, as one of 96 black freshmen. Today that number seems small. But there had been only six black students just three years before.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Gates belonged to the first <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> wave at top universities -- a wave that continued into the 1970s and the 1980s. I was one of its beneficiaries. A black 17-year-old from Monrovia, Liberia, I was one of some 200 black freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1983.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My first roommate was a white student from Seagrove, N.C., whose SAT scores and grade-point average were higher than mine. Privately, I consoled myself that I had qualifications that she didn't: I could name the capital of every country in Africa; countries she had never heard of. I knew where the Zambezi River emptied into the Indian Ocean. None of that had been on the SAT.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But every now and then I feared I was faking it, that my white classmates had something I didn't. There were things they seemed to know instinctively, that I had to look up. I remember  getting laughed at during a game of Pictionary when I couldn't come up with the word for a giant bird landing on a lawn with a baby in its mouth.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My feelings of inadequacy were not unusual, said David L. Evans, the Saturn/Apollo electrical engineer hired by Harvard in 1969 to help lead its <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> program. When Mr. Evans visited public high schools in Arkansas in search of promising black students, he was met with skepticism. \"Even people who didn't have any mean-spiritedness would say to the students, 'You going to be up there with the Kennedys?' \" he recalled. \" 'How do you think you can make it there?' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There was  anxiety, too, among  the originators of race-based <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> programs. \"The idealistic version of why these universities embraced racial <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is that they said, 'Hey, we're in the business of training elites, it would be better for America if there were a diverse elite,' \" said Nicholas Lemann,  dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and  author of \"The Big Test,\" a history of the SAT and the rise of America's meritocracy. To its architects, the minority recruitment was the next phase for universities that for years had paved the way for whites, particularly the offspring of upper-class alumni, Mr. Lemann said.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"The cynical version of why they did this is they said, 'We can't control this country, it's becoming too diverse, we need to socialize the brighter minorities and make them more like us.' \"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In many ways, being molded into people \"more like us\" gave the children of 1969 an advantage denied most of their white counterparts. They learned to navigate within a second world. They also absorbed some of its ideas and values. And they paved the way for the next generation.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"We had to go through this phase of larger integration for Barack Obama to be possible,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview a few days  after his arrest. \"It would have been impossible for Barack Obama to go from a historic black school to become president, at this time. The whole point is that a broad swath of America had to be able to identify with him.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It also enabled Mr. Obama to run \"the most race-blind campaign\" of any black presidential candidate, said Gwen Ifill, the PBS news reporter whose book \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama\" examines the rise of African-Americans in politics.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Perhaps. But the children of 1969 dwell in a complex world. They retain  an ethnic identity that includes its own complement of cultural, historical and psychological issues and considerations. This emerged at Judge Sotomayor's confirmation hearings. And it emerged again last week, when Mr. Obama joked in the White House East Room that if he ran afoul of the police, \"I'd get shot.\" In saying this, he seemed to draw on the fears of black men across the United States, including those within the new power elite.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>What Mr. Obama seemed to be demonstrating was what Mr. Lemann of Columbia calls a \"double consciousness\" that allows the children of 1969 to flow more easily between the world which their skin color bequeathed them and the world which their college degree opened up for them.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It's the same double consciousness I acquired at U.N.C., though I didn't think about it that way as a student. Sure, my white friends were learning a little more about black (and African) culture from me. But I was absorbing much more from them, since they surrounded me in such great number. At the time it seemed I had the advantage;   I would leave college having gotten much more from my interactions with my white friends than they could possibly have gotten from me. And the principal thing I learned was how to make them feel at ease around me.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Except, of course, on those occasions when one can't. Life outside the university doesn't duplicate the conditions of university life.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"I can't wear my Harvard gown everywhere I go,\" Professor Gates said. \"We -- all of us in the crossover generation -- have multiple identities, and being black trumps all of those other identities.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Friday Mr. Obama said he hoped Mr. Gates's incident might become a \"teachable moment.\" It is a daunting task for the children of 1969: finding out whether the double consciousness they honed in the Ivy League can actually get this country to listen -- and react -- to race in a different way.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>HELENE COOPER           Helene Cooper, a White House correspondent for The Times, is the author of \"The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Princeton: Sonia Sotomayor.

The searing news of the disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Black Americans has added to the urgency of this moment.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But not for Donald Trump. His long record of embracing racism as a political tool -- from his promotion of the \"birther\" lie about Barack Obama to his defense of white supremacists -- has made him the most racially polarizing president in the last century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Yet while many Republican \"Never Trumpers\" condemn Trump for his brazen appeals to white supremacy, they are curiously silent on Ronald Reagan's record on race and civil rights. It's no accident that the Party of Reagan morphed so easily into the Party of Trump.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Long before Trump descended his golden escalator, promising to \"Make America Great Again,\" Reagan was the first to use the slogan \"Let's Make America Great Again,\" vowing to return America to its past glory before the civil rights movement toppled Jim Crow in the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Whenever the issue of Reagan's hostility to civil rights and unpopularity with Black Americans is broached, conservatives leap to Reagan's defense and stress his apparent lack of personal racism. That view has been shredded by the disclosure last year of a phone call in October 1971 between Richard Nixon and Reagan, in which Reagan described African diplomats as \"monkeys\" who were still \"uncomfortable wearing their shoes.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan's sunny vision of America as a \"shining city\" may be the antithesis of Donald Trump's dystopian American \"carnage,\" he masterfully deployed racially coded language and other dog whistles like \"states' rights,\" \"law and order\" and \"welfare queens\" that resonated with middle-class taxpayers without appearing racist.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One telling illustration is Reagan's decision to give a major speech in his 1980 campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., only miles from where three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered in 1964. Looking back, it is eerily similar to Trump's decision to hold a campaign rally on the day after Juneteenth in Tulsa, Okla., the site of the worst racial massacre in the 20th century.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan was the first presidential nominee of a major political party to attend that fair since it started in 1889, and that fact was not lost on the 20,000 white people gathered there on Aug. 3, 1980, many proudly waving Confederate flags and chanting, \"We want Reagan! We want Reagan!\" The crowd was exhilarated with his declaring his fidelity to states' rights, which for a century had been the South's rallying cry to prevent the federal government from interfering with its racial customs.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>That speech helped Reagan sweep every Southern state except President Carter's home state of Georgia. Since then, the Old Confederacy has been the heart of the GOP. On the eve of Reagan's inauguration, Black Americans feared an assault on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>These fears were well-founded. After all, Reagan began his political career with his 1966 campaign for California governor by denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while running radio ads referring to urban areas as \"jungles.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Only months after the Watts riots, Reagan made \"law and order\" and opposition to California's far-reaching Fair Housing Act the centerpiece of his campaign to oust the liberal incumbent, Pat Brown.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan repeatedly said, \"If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes in the sale or renting of his property, it is his right to do so.\" This stance resonated with millions of middle-class white voters, many of whom had never voted for a Republican, but voted for Reagan in part because they feared African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's success in making inroads with white working-class voters in the booming suburbs of Southern California was a template for the \"law and order\" and \"silent majority\" rhetoric that fueled Nixon's presidential victory in 1968. Reagan mounted an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1968, in which he crisscrossed the South and white enclaves across the country thrilling conservative audiences with his scorching attacks on lawless civil rights agitators and his tough talk of law and order. Just hours after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Reagan called King's assassination \"a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In 1976, Reagan, in challenging Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, popularized the racist trope of a \"welfare queen,\" repeating at virtually every campaign stop, before white audiences, the fictitious story of a Black welfare cheat, subsidized by hardworking white taxpayers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Overall, Reagan's two-term presidency marked a new nadir in race relations. His administration tried to dilute the Voting Rights Act, vitiated the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and vowed to abolish <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, arguing that white men were the only victims -- of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Reagan's attitudes on civil rights were reflected in his refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa; he vetoed a 1986 bill imposing sanctions, which Congress overrode. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu was so incensed that he declared Reagan \"a racist, pure and simple.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most egregiously, Reagan was instrumental in ratcheting up the \"war on drugs,\" which has led to the mass incarceration of Black and poor people of color and the destruction of families and communities. His administration adopted a series of draconian laws that resulted in the imprisonment rate of African Americans on drug charges that is almost six times that of whites, even though whites use illicit drugs at a similar rate.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While Reagan eschewed the overt racism of Trump, his racial politics paved the way for Trump. In fact, Reagan's brand of racism was perhaps more sinister than Trump's because he did it with a genial smile. In reckoning with Trump, we need to reckon with Reagan's legacy. And that began with his appeal to white voters in Southern California.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Caption: PHOTO: RONALD REAGAN, at the 1976 GOP National Convention, repeatedly used the trope of the Black \"welfare queen\" to appeal to white voters.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>PHOTOGRAPHER:David Hume Kennerly Getty Images</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Credit: Daniel S.

The lessons here are instructive. The ballot measure claimed to end \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in state schools. It resulted in a 25% reduction in Black student enrollment at state colleges and universities \u2014 the largest decline among all groups. Two decades later, UC\u2019s Black enrollment is about 5%; it was slightly more than 7% pre-Prop. 209.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As the executive director of Black College Success \u2014 a community-based nonprofit that provides academic pathways to colleges and universities for hundreds of Black students in South Los Angeles \u2014 I\u2019m forced to reckon with the difficulty of improving such statistics. You should know that 75% of Black students from the Los Angeles Unified School District don\u2019t enroll in and 85% don\u2019t graduate from a four-year college or university. They come from communities where the median family income is less than $48,000 a year, and where less than 10% of community members have a college degree.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Despite these terrible odds, in May, the Black College Success team celebrated the admission of 208 students to more than 40 colleges and universities, including prestigious institutions such as Stanford, Pepperdine, Pitzer, Tulane and New York University.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>It was far from easy for these students. For instance, Jackson, 18 and headed to a competitive school in the northeast, grew up in a single-parent household with a hardworking father who drives for Amazon, faced the challenges of being a Black man in L.A., avoiding gang life and supporting his siblings.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ajaa, 17, will be a freshman at an HBCU \u2014 a historically Black college or university \u2014 in Georgia. She won more than $100,000 in scholarships while working part time to support her family, including take care of her younger brother so that her mother could attend school too.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We\u2019re not only trying to shatter the boundaries Black students from South Los Angeles face in gaining access to college, but to also help make clear the transformative opportunity that college offers their families financially for the future.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of the students we work with will be the first in their families to go to college. And our help doesn\u2019t stop there. To get them to graduation (our first cohort hasn\u2019t yet reached that milestone), we follow them wherever they enroll, with continued counseling about class choices and majors and career possibilities.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>So, how do we do it? And how will we do it in a post-<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> world?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>There\u2019s just one way: one student at a time.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>First comes the work of finding and recruiting high schoolers for the program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Beginning as early as sophomore year (as we continue to expand, we\u2019ll eventually work with students starting the moment they enter high school), a team of \u201ccollege access managers,\u201d who are from the same neighborhoods as our students and have backgrounds in college recruitment, go into our partner high schools, which have expressed an interest in working with us.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The managers figuratively and literally meet the students where they are and offer them an array of supports, starting with academic planning assistance for their A-G requirements, the classes students must complete with a grade of C or better to be eligible to enter the Cal State or UC systems. No matter where students apply, the A-G standards are an objective demonstration that they\u2019re college ready.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>At times, the students\u2019 need for mentoring is far greater than our capacity, so we partner with in-school resources, such as the newly created Black Student Achievement Program, and lock arms with other nonprofits like Brotherhood Crusade, 826LA, Los Angeles Urban League and others that can help us provide writing workshops, access to advanced courses and a range of extracurricular activities, stipends for summer internships, career guidance and scholarships.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Once our students become seniors, they receive one-on-one college application assistance, personal statement workshops and financial aid advice. We take them on college and university visits and help them evaluate their choices. Our aim is to provide them with everything they need to level the landscape against peers who often enjoy significant advantages, such as private tutors and schools with more funding and resources than those in South L.A.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In doing this work, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not how high a student\u2019s GPA is or how impressive their test scores are that gets results. It\u2019s an all-of-the-above mix of academics, guidance and the students\u2019 own determination \u2014 the ability of a Jackson or an Ajaa to persevere.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I\u2019ve seen stories like theirs by the dozens. My fear is that, in the unfortunate new world of colorblind admissions, the opportunities available to them will diminish. If colleges and universities look past the distinctive experiences of Black applicants, it\u2019s not just the students who will lose, but society.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Ibert Schultz is the executive director of Black College Success, a project of the LA Promise Fund.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"In Favor/Supports": "stance:::In Favor/Supports"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/1878508466.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>What to ask Judge Gorsuch; Look beyond politics and his resume. Make him talk seriously about his judicial philosophy.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court seat that has been vacant since the death more than a year ago of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The cynical conventional wisdom is that Republicans will lob softballs at the nominee, Democrats will try to portray his decisions on the federal appeals court in Denver as hostile to \"the little guy,\" and the judge himself will say as little as possible about controversial legal questions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>We'd like to suggest a different approach: Senators should engage the nominee in a serious discussion of his views about the Constitution, the role of precedent and how the court should adapt general principles to changing social and scientific circumstances. And Gorsuch should respond in kind by speaking as frankly as he can, demurring only about specific cases that are likely to come before him.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Granted, Democrats are justifiably angry that the Republican majority never allowed hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland, President Obama's eminently qualified nominee to replace Scalia. One consequence of that power play is that Democratic senators are under extreme pressure from their liberal base to oppose Gorsuch. Beyond that, they have legitimate concerns about how Gorsuch's confirmation could affect progressive causes, from gay and transgender rights to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> and reproductive rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Democrats are free to remind their Republican colleagues -- and Gorsuch -- of the injustice done to Obama and Garland. They also have every right to question the nominee about his rulings on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and his previous work, such as the role he played as a Justice Department lawyer in defending the George W. Bush administration's policies on interrogating and detaining suspected terrorists.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the main focus should be how Gorsuch would approach the role of a Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch is only 49; if confirmed, he could sit on the court for decades and outlast several presidents and Congresses. In particular, they should explore how Gorsuch would interpret the Constitution and, to a lesser extent, acts of Congress.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Like Scalia, Gorsuch has been described as an \"originalist,\" someone who interprets the Constitution according to the meaning its provisions had at the time they were adopted. In a speech at Case Western Reserve University Law School last year, Gorsuch said judges should strive to \"apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This formula is much less straightforward than it seems. For one thing, \"text\" and \"history\" can be at odds because language can have different connotations at different times. For example, to Americans in the 19th century, the \"equal protection of the laws\" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment might seem to protect only racial equality; in the 20th century it seemed obvious to many Americans that it also prohibited some forms of sexual discrimination. Does Gorsuch object to that updated interpretation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Does he believe that a constitutional provision must be viewed through the eyes of the generation in which it was adopted and can't be interpreted to deal with situations its authors couldn't have imagined, such as cellphone signals being used to track suspects without a warrant? The U.S. Constitution has never been that sort of rigid document.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Scalia, for whom Gorsuch has expressed great admiration, was zealous in defending relatively specific rights mentioned in the Constitution, including freedom of speech and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures -- even in circumstances that the Constitution's framers couldn't have anticipated, such as the sale of video games or the use by police of GPS technology. But Scalia's version of originalism led to him dissent stridently from rulings recognizing rights, such as abortion or marriage equality for gays and lesbians, that his colleagues rightly read into more general language in the Constitution about \"liberty\" and \"equal protection of the laws.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Those decisions were a natural outgrowth of earlier rulings in which the court secured other rights that the Constitution didn't explicitly guarantee, such as a right to marry someone of another race (or the right to marry at all) or the right to use contraceptives in the privacy of one's bedroom. An America in which those decisions had come out the other way would not be an America in which most of us would want to live.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Senators should ask Gorsuch whether he shares Scalia's disdain for the court's decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage and, if so, whether he would nevertheless accord those decisions respect as precedents of the court. It's entirely possible that Gorsuch would not have joined the decisions legalizing abortion or same-sex marriage but also wouldn't agitate to overturn those rulings if he joined the court. Gorsuch reportedly told Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that he didn't believe a long-established precedent should be overruled simply because five current justices think it was wrongly decided. That's a possibility the committee should look into, but as part of a broader inquiry into Gorsuch's view of the importance of precedent and predictability in the law. (Some precedents, after all, should be overturned -- witness Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 ruling that approved segregation in public facilities.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if Gorsuch wouldn't upset existing precedents, he could make it harder for the court to adapt to future changes in American society if he took too constrained an \"originalist\" approach going forward. That's why it's important that senators engage him in a dialogue about his view of the court's role that goes beyond hot-button issues such as abortion, guns and gay rights.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Gorsuch is obviously an accomplished jurist. He has been rated \"well qualified\" by the American Bar Assn. (as was Garland, who never was permitted to appear before the Judiciary Committee). Unlike some Trump appointees, he is neither a crony nor someone whose professional credentials can be questioned. But the Senate has a right to look beyond a sterling resume to inquire about the philosophy that will help shape the court for decades to come.</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}

Few experts in the press or academe wanted to probe this most politically incorrect topic until Louisiana's David Duke seized the issue and became a political force.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>General population polls conducted by Gordon Black Associates in 1984 and by the National Opinion Research Center in 1990 suggest that 1-in-10 white men has been injured by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. This figure alone adds up to millions. Circumstantial evidence suggests even larger numbers.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Preferential policies were instituted during an intensely competitive era when huge cohorts of baby boomers crowded job markets increasingly constrained by international competition, lean-and-mean downsizing movements, and tax revolts. Thus, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> often occurred in zero-sum contexts; someone was quota-ed in at another's expense.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>My research indicates that reverse discrimination's bite has varied by age, geography, occupation, and private or public sector. Most vulnerable have been public-sector white men under the age of 45 with people-oriented skills. Their phone calls flood radio talk-show programs on this topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Many more white men may not have been fully aware that they were being injured by behind-the-scenes tactics such as \"race-norming\" of employment tests by public testing agencies, and many private ones. (The EEOC only recently stopped pressuring corporations to use such procedures.) Nor have they been told of the drive to tie managers' bonuses to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hiring and promotion records.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>I became curious about the impact of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while working in the increasingly quota-crazy higher education systems of California -- where policies moved far beyond the Supreme Court's 1978 Bakke dictum that race could be considered as one of several factors in selection processes.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>During the 1980s, a state mandate for the community college system (AB1725) ordered a 30% minority-faculty hiring \"goal\" until the year 2005 -- when faculty must mirror the ethnic diversity of the entire state; the University of California began advertising \"targets of diversity\" faculty positions and substantially boosted minority-female representation in administrative staff positions to 72%; and the California State University system implemented set-aside faculty positions, set-aside grant and fellowship programs for graduate students -- while the politically correct faculty union lobbied (successfully) for higher pay for \"underrepresented\" junior faculty. And \"parity goals\" for the entire state work force were monitored in annual reports by the State Personnel Board.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>As my quiet interest in <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> leaked out -- a professionally dangerous development -- students, colleagues, friends and relative strangers began to report encounters with reverse discrimination. In 1984-85, two graduate assistants and I supplemented this rising tide of informal data -- and scattered press reports -- with 32 in-depth interviews with California-based, mostly middle-class white men who reported that preferential policies prevented them from obtaining jobs or disrupted or ended extant careers. Some findings:</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A community college instructor repeatedly lost tenure-track appointments to less qualified minorities after he moved to California from Michigan. \"At first, you think it's you,\" he said. \"You blame yourself.\" (He finally obtained an appointment at another college.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- A mid-management bank administrator -- and an ardent liberal -- began to have second thoughts as he watched women he'd hired the year before move by him on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative-action</span> fast-track. (Rapid increases in female mid-management employees in his bank and at others lent credence to his account.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>-- Public-sector workers reported that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> barriers eventually became obvious and quietly acknowledged by most employees. After 13 years of being bypassed by minorities or women, one upper-middle-management California state official reported being offered a promotion -- with some public fanfare -- only to have the appointment rescinded because, as an agency head told him, \"Let's face it, you're not the right color.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Most of these men avoided open complaints or protests out of fear they wouldn't be believed or would be labeled racist. (No one said he feared being thought sexist.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Six resigned from the organizations that discriminated against them. Three circumvented reverse discrimination problems through various organizational means. Three filed suits, none of which was successful. No government agency offered redress. (EEOC guidelines effectively insulate employers from reverse discrimination complaints if the employer has taken \"reasonable\" voluntary <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> to remedy \"deficiencies\" in minority representation.)</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The majority of our subjects simply acquiesced in their treatment with varying degrees of bewilderment, resignation or anger. Most subjects voiced temporary, if not long-term, frustration and cynicism about social institutions. \"A lot of us were sold a bill of goods,\" complained a California state middle-management worker. \"We were told if you went to college you could write your own ticket. But . . . <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has lowered standards to the point where education counts against you.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>No subject expressed hostility toward minorities per se, but many felt alienated from a society that refused to acknowledge whites' victimization. A teacher, transferred to a distant school in a racial balancing plan, commented: \"My friends couldn't handle this. They experienced cognitive dissonance. They didn't want to be seen as racists.\" Another teacher noted: \"I found out what it was like to be a victim. Nobody likes a victim.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Research sponsored and then suppressed by the Democratic Party in 1985 and 1987 suggests a possible class split in white reactions to <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Political analyst Stanley Greenberg's \"Report on Democratic Defections\" by blue-collar white \"Reagan Democrats\" in Michigan found fury over quotas for blacks and immigrants. (This anger, Mr. Greenberg concluded, undercut Democratic campaign themes of \"fairness\" and \"justice.\") These data, in combination with the record of lawsuits filed by blue-collar groups (overtly or covertly aided by unions), indicate a more militant, angry working-class response. This is perhaps because of more intense zero-sum problems wrought by a shrinking blue-collar jobs market.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Until Pete Wilson, Jesse Helms and David Duke began to attack quotas in statewide election campaigns last year, a curious bipartisan paralysis thwarted any open political response to rank-and-file whites.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Radicals and liberals have neutralized whites' complaints with swift, categorical denials, such as \"white males can't be victims.\" Indeed, much liberal and multicultural theory today embodies a colorized version of Marx's class struggle. White men (regardless of individual backgrounds) are regarded as a privileged modern-day \"bourgeoisie,\" while women and people of color (again, regardless of individual or subgroup circumstances) are the oppressed \"proletariat.\" Any mention of a white working class -- once prominently represented in labor histories -- is simply met with more rationalizations or with awkward silence.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Conservatives have been inclined to dismiss white men's complaints of reverse discrimination because of conservatism's rugged individualistic and free-market underpinnings. White men injured by <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are likely to be told to \"take it like a man\" and get on with their lives. Conservatives are also likely to harbor the assumption that an injured white man can simply quit the offending organization and get another job or start his own business. And there's been more than a hint of class bias. Conservatives are not overly fond of historically Democratic, unionized, white, blue-collar and public-sector workers. Some right-of-center writers have sneered at \"firefighters\" (presumably racist brethren of Archie Bunker) who complain of reverse discrimination.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The stereotype of \"racist\" working-class white men has made most journalists, academics and politicians fearful of acquiring a \"racist\" label themselves if they even raise the white-male problem. Thus, most of the recent debate over <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has focused on the safer topics of costs to employers and the stigmatization of officially favored groups.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Unwanted, inadvertent findings about whites and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> have been buried. Just as the Greenberg studies were suppressed in the mid-1980s, a 1990 study by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, designed to provide impetus for the 1991 civil rights bill, was bottled up. News leaks indicated the study uncovered substantial white anger toward <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> preferences.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>One study not buried was the recent, well-publicized Urban Institute study in which matched black/white pairs of job seekers were sent out to test discrimination in hiring. In 67% of the outcomes, neither applicant was offered a job; in 13%, both the black and white applicants were offered the job; in 15% of the cases, only the white applicant was offered the job, while in 5% of the cases the black received the offer-indicating only minimal levels of reverse discrimination. However, the institute study ignored the public sector entirely, as well as people-oriented, liberal-arts types of jobs. Would the institute be willing to dispatch black/white teams to apply for openings in California state agencies? In universities?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'><span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">Affirmative action</span>'s impact upon white males must also be viewed as a legitimate topic of discussion if we are to understand how these policies have both functioned and malfunctioned. An earlier, fair hearing of whites' complaints might have led to the recognition that, in practice, <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> has become what George Will has aptly termed a racial spoils system with all attendant corruptions.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lingering white racism is to be condemned. But it is unjust and inaccurate to automatically attribute whites' criticisms of flawed policies to racism. Further suppression will only obscure troubling realities and lead to emotional exploitation of an important topic.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>---</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Lynch is visiting associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California, and author of \"Invisible Victims: White Males and the Crisis of Affirmative Action\" (Praeger Paperbacks, 1991).</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Against/Opposes": "stance:::Against/Opposes"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}

{"id": "aa_opeds_sample/txt/432415722.xml.txt", "displayed_text": "<div><p>Fixing the Race Gap in 25 Years or Less</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>THE Supreme Court decision upholding <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> in university admissions seemed to carry an expiration date. ''We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in her 5-to-4 majority opinion last week.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>While the justices have in the past said that <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> should not be used forever, never before has a justice placed a specific time limit on it. Having now done so, Justice O'Connor has raised tough questions, both broad and specific.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Are her views merely idle musings, or will they become an iron-clad legal principle? Should the goal be parity in graduation rates of white, black and Hispanic high school students? Or should it be equality in financing between poor school districts, which tend to have more minority students, and middle-class white ones? Can the gap between black and white students on the SAT be bridged in the next generation?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In The Chicago Tribune, Justice O'Connor said in a rare interview that the country can tackle many of these challenges. ''I hope it looks as though we don't need artificial help to fill our classrooms with highly qualified students at the graduate level,'' she said. ''And if we do our job on educating young people, we can reach that goal.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But closing the disparities in educational achievement and opportunities for college applicants across racial and ethnic lines will involve vociferous debate over the relative importance of school financing, social inequality and student study habits.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Statistics tell the story. On every major indicator of academic success -- the SAT, the A.C.T. and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (given to elementary and secondary students) -- the gap between white and minority students has persisted for decades. Though it narrowed somewhat on the national assessment exams from the 1980's through the early 90's, the divide has only widened since then.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''There is some serious heavy lifting to do before we get to the dream scenario Justice O'Connor is envisioning,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Some liberals say the gap can be closed only by equalizing the amount of money spent on educating whites and minorities. The school districts that many blacks and Hispanics attend spend $902 less per student on average than mostly white districts, according to a national study conducted last year by the Education Trust, a group focused on closing the achievement gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To some degree, federal and state governments can, and do, try to fix this imbalance by sending more money to schools serving poor -- and, by extension, disproportionately minority -- students. Federal assistance for poor students is increasing, and state governments gave an average of $27 more per pupil to disproportionately minority schools in 2000 than to predominately white schools, though that hardly had a perceptible impact on the financing gap.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even if federal and state lawmakers were bent on eliminating the financial discrepancies between white and minority districts, they couldn't have much affect. On average, states and the federal government have never accounted for more than 56 percent of schools' revenues over the last decade or so; the remainder has come from local sources, mostly property taxes. This financial structure makes parity unlikely at best.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>And conservatives argue that the focus on financial parity misses the point, and point to some minority-dominated city school districts that have high spending per student but still lag well behind less flush districts, particularly in rural areas.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Moreover, educational parity may be linked to bigger, more complex economic factors. Most beneficiaries of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> are middle-income. According to a study by Anthony Carnevale, vice president of the Educational Testing Service, 74 percent of students at the 146 most prestigious colleges and universities -- where competition for admissions is most intense and where <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is practiced -- come from families in the top 25 percent of the nation's socioeconomic scale (as measured by income, educational attainment and occupations of the parents). Only 3 percent of the students at these highly selective schools come from the bottom 25 percent of the socioeconomic scale. As Lani Guinier, a law professor at Harvard University, puts it, ''<span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> is less an escalator up than it is a bridge across.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But even middle-class black and Hispanic children who are burdened with issues of crime, troubled homes and poor schools have not been able to close the test-score gap with their white counterparts.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>''The gap persists across all income levels,'' said Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, who has written extensively on improving the academic achievement of black students. ''We're talking about generations of habits in too many homes,'' said Mr. Hrabowski, who is black. ''Unfortunately, reading is not the No. 1 priority as a habit. There is much more emphasis on television watching.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Both sides on the <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> issue agree on the need to close the education gap, but not much else. Some supporters of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> hope that Justice O'Connor's 25-year time frame will protect <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> while the country makes headway in closing that rift.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But the decision last week does not invalidate laws in California and Washington State that ban the use of race in public university admissions, hiring and government contracting. Ward Connerly, the black California businessman who was the force behind passing those laws, has already vowed to make Michigan his next target.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Demographic pressures will also come into play. The Educational Testing Service estimates that from 1995 to 2015, the percentage of whites on college campuses will decline from 71 percent to 63 percent, while Hispanics will increase to 15 percent, from the current 11 percent, with blacks holding steady at 13 percent.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But with minorities making up a larger proportion of students going to college -- and with the children of young immigrants approaching college age toward the end of Justice O'Connor's 25-year target -- Hispanic and black parents may be clamoring even more forcefully that their children not be shut out of top schools.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>In the end, the debate has not changed. Opponents of <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> will continue to say that such programs keep the country from focusing on what needs to be done -- namely, helping minority students meet higher standards. The supporters of race preferences counter that the country cannot end <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span> without first fixing the education system. All agree that unless a commitment is made -- by society and minority families themselves -- the old arguments will still be around in 25 years.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Lisa Navarette, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said, ''If all we do over the 25 years is <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>, then we will still need <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>.''</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Diversity, 1964: The University of Michigan Law School yearbook reflects the times.

The parties promised to sin no more and before long, the affair had faded into the misty regions of memory.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The media turned to other pursuits and today, as Nicholas Lemann writes in the Atlantic Monthly, \"The press, which pays close attention to politics and government through deeply ingrained reflex, largely ignores foundations, or treats them, in a polite but faintly bored tone, as innocuous do-gooders rather than significant actors.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Our interest in these institutions flickered briefly a couple of years ago when conservative elements in Congress started asking questions and proposing legislation to curb the political activities of foundations and the thousands of tax-exempt special interest groups that have spread like kudzu during the past 25 years. They now occupy a respectable share of the available office space in Washington. The \"public interests\" they represent range from the World Association of Alcohol Beverage Industries and the Dairy Recognition Foundation to the League of Women Voters and the YMCA.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Tax exemption, as Lemann reminds us, is granted to foundations and their \"public interest\" cousins on condition that they forswear any \"attempt to influence political or legislative outcomes, except by providing technical information. This rule is violated widely. In fact, it's difficult to think of a significant policy initiative taken by the federal government or voiced in a recent presidential campaign that didn't have some foundation undergirding.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The problem is complicated by the federal government, which provides funding to many politically active nonprofits -- the National Council of Senior Citizens, for example -- that administer various federal educational and job-training programs. Republican critics in Congress claim that through bookkeeping devices these federal grants can be misused to finance political activities. They lost the fight last year, and the subject has more or less vanished from media agendas. That is unfortunate because foundations and the \"public interest\" nonprofits are a big, influential and expanding industry. Lemann reports that during the past 15 years or so the number of foundations has nearly doubled, from 22,000 to 39,000. Their assets now exceed $200 billion, half of it controlled by fewer than 200 foundations, according to another student of the industry, Alan Reynolds of the Hudson Institute.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>This wealth, he writes, represents \"enormous influence over which public policy, social program or artistic endeavor will succeed or fail.\" Lemann makes a similar point. Big foundations, \"which have a distinctly liberal cast use their tax-exempt dollars to fund everything from the civil rights movement to studies supporting the expansion of the welfare state to disarmament and population control abroad.\" As conservative foundations have prospered since 1980 they \"have been particularly successful in training cadres of activists and policymakers to serve their cause, by subsidizing books that change the tenor of public discourse (for example, Dinesh D'Souza's `Illiberal Education') and supplying the government with policy ideas (the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the early Reagan Administration . . . ).\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The reach of the foundations is felt in ostensibly private affairs as well. Peter Skerry, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, recalls in the Wilson Quarterly the 1994 upheaval within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The incumbent executive director, Benjamin Chavis, was ousted. \"But it was seldom noted {in the press},\" Skerry observes, \"that his removal was instigated not by the membership but by the Ford Foundation, which withheld a major grant until the NAACP's finances were put in order. One of the few observers who did note it was Washington Post columnist William Raspberry {who asked} . . . how such a venerable organization, still 600,000 members strong, has come to the point . . . of being beholden to a private foundation for its survival?\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Foundations may even work through relatively hollow organizational fronts. Skerry cites the case of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) \"which seeks to represent not only all Mexican Americans but all of the nation's 27 million Latinos. This claim is widely accepted, and the organization has played a prominent role in recent debates over immigration and <span style=\"background-color:yellow;\">affirmative action</span>. Yet it has no members and gets most of its funding from corporations and foundations, especially the Ford Foundation, which played the critical role in establishing it in the late 1960s. Lacking members, MALDEF has no real bonds of accountability to the communities it strives to represent.\"</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The Kettering Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia foundation, are less well-known than the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. But they have had a significant impact on a number of nongovernmental institutions, including the American press. Their intellectual leadership and money have been largely responsible for the \"civic journalism\" movement that has been taken up by the media in more than 40 cities. The guiding principle of \"civic journalism\" is that the public, through polls and \"focus groups\" usually financed by the foundations, should play an important role in setting the news and editorial agendas of the press. Newspapers and broadcasters that have embraced the movement are generally pleased with the results.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>But many critics such as William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, believe the press risks its independence and credibility by aligning itself and becoming financially beholden to foundations with \"a very ideological view of America, a very definite view of the road America should take.\" He puts Pew in that category.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>To Lemann, the broader problem is that foundations \"have no voters, no customers, no investors.\" So they operate in an unexamined environment, ignored by the press and public alike. No one asks the \"main policy questions about them -- How, exactly, should their economic and political activities be restricted in return for their tax-exempt status? Does the tax exemption still make sense ?</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>\"This {isolation} ought to change. Foundations are becoming so much more significant so rapidly that they deserve to be brought into the company of central institutions whose course is the subject of constant public scrutiny and debate.\"</p></div>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"None/Not Discussed": "stance:::None/Not Discussed"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}

For that reason alone, President Clinton's national town meeting on race, held in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday evening, was an important contribution to the national debate. The discussion lacked focus and spark, but the President showed courage, skill and persistence in probing the most problematic social issue of the day.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>For two hours, before a national television audience, Mr. Clinton spoke to 67 college students, civic leaders and business people in the first of his scheduled town meetings on race. He said he wanted to ''drop a pebble in the pond'' that would ripple into a broad, national discussion. The participants spoke guardedly but often movingly on issues of racial identity, <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and education. But there were few real ripples until Mr. Clinton raised the issue of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span>, bluntly confronting one of the evening's panelists who is critical of the policy. Turning to the writer Abigail Thernstrom, Mr. Clinton asked if she would abolish the kind of <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> the Army used to produce Gen. Colin Powell, the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>The question was to the point, given that the Army's strategies for recruiting and promoting minority soldiers have long been recognized as a resounding success. Ms. Thernstrom's response -- that there was a difference between <span style='background-color:yellow;'>affirmative action</span> and racial preferences -- was worthy of longer discussion than it got. The exchange could have boosted the energy level had it occurred at the beginning of the evening. The question of how the Army did what it did -- and why the other armed services lagged far behind -- could profitably have taken up a large portion of the evening, or an entire program.</p><p style='font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;'>Mr. Clinton was visibly frustrated that the participants were less open and candid than he had hoped. But full candor would be difficult, given the delicate nature of the subject. The remaining town  meetings could be more fruitful if they are better planned, with each segment of the program devoted to a different issue -- discussed with concrete examples and provocative guests.</p>", "label_annotations": {"stance": {"Neutral": "stance:::Neutral"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 0s "}}
